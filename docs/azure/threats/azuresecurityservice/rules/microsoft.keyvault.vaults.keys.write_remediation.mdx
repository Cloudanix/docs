### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.KeyVault.vaults.keys.write event in AzureRealTime for AzureSecurityService refers to the action of writing or creating a new key in an Azure Key Vault.
- This event indicates that a user or application has performed a write operation to create a new key within the specified Azure Key Vault.
- It is important to monitor this event as it can help track key creation activities and ensure proper access controls and permissions are in place for managing keys in the Azure Key Vault.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.KeyVault.vaults.keys.write event in Azure Security Service is compromised, it could potentially allow unauthorized users to create or modify keys within an Azure Key Vault. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources protected by those keys.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and monitor the Azure Key Vault access policies to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to create or modify keys.
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users accessing the Azure Key Vault.
- Enable Azure Key Vault logging and monitoring to detect any suspicious activities related to key creation or modification.
- Consider implementing Azure Key Vault soft delete feature to enable recovery of deleted keys within a specified retention period.

Example CLI command to enable soft delete for an Azure Key Vault:
```
az keyvault update --name <key_vault_name> --enable-soft-delete true
```

2. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.KeyVault.vaults.keys.write event in Azure Security Service is triggered by an unauthorized user, they could potentially overwrite or delete existing keys within an Azure Key Vault. This could result in the loss of access to encrypted data or resources.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and monitor the Azure Key Vault access policies to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to create or modify keys.
- Implement Azure Key Vault access policies with the principle of least privilege, granting only the required permissions to specific users or applications.
- Enable Azure Key Vault logging and monitoring to detect any suspicious activities related to key creation or modification.
- Implement Azure Key Vault backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure that keys can be restored in case of accidental deletion or overwrite.

Example CLI command to set access policies for an Azure Key Vault:
```
az keyvault set-policy --name <key_vault_name> --object-id <user_or_service_principal_object_id> --key-permissions create delete get list update
```

3. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.KeyVault.vaults.keys.write event in Azure Security Service is triggered by a malicious insider, they could potentially create new keys with elevated privileges or modify existing keys to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls and segregation of duties to minimize the risk of insider threats.
- Regularly review and monitor the Azure Key Vault access policies to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to create or modify keys.
- Enable Azure Key Vault logging and monitoring to detect any suspicious activities related to key creation or modification.
- Implement Azure Key Vault auditing to track and investigate any unauthorized changes to keys.

Example CLI command to enable auditing for an Azure Key Vault:
```
az keyvault update --name <key_vault_name> --enable-purge-protection true
```
