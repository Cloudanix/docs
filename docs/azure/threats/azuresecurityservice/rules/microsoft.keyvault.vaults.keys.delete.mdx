### Event Information

- The Microsoft.KeyVault.vaults.keys.delete event in Azure for AzureSecurityService indicates that a key has been deleted from an Azure Key Vault.
- This event signifies that a specific key within the Key Vault has been permanently removed and cannot be recovered.
- It is important to monitor this event as it may indicate potential security risks or unauthorized access to the Key Vault.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with Microsoft.KeyVault.vaults.keys.delete in Azure for AzureSecurityService, it could mean that an unauthorized user or entity has gained access to the Azure Security Service and is able to delete keys from the Key Vault. This could lead to a potential compromise of sensitive data or resources protected by those keys.

2. Data loss or service disruption: Deleting keys from the Key Vault can result in data loss or service disruption, especially if those keys are being used to encrypt or protect critical resources or sensitive information. This could lead to a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the affected resources or data.

3. Compliance violations: Deleting keys from the Key Vault without proper authorization or documentation can result in compliance violations, especially if the keys are being used to protect data governed by specific regulations or standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS). This can lead to legal and financial consequences for the organization, as well as damage to its reputation.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion and key deletion without proper logging in Azure for AzureSecurityService using the Azure console, you can follow these steps:

1. Enable Azure Key Vault soft delete: Soft delete allows you to recover deleted keys within a retention period, providing an additional layer of protection against unauthorized deletion. To enable soft delete, follow these steps:
   - Open the Azure portal and navigate to the Azure Key Vault service.
   - Select the Key Vaults option from the left-hand menu.
   - Choose the Key Vault where the unauthorized deletion occurred.
   - In the Key Vault's settings, select the "Soft delete" option.
   - Set the retention period for deleted keys according to your organization's requirements.
   - Save the changes.

2. Enable Azure Key Vault logging and auditing: Enabling logging and auditing for Azure Key Vault will ensure that all key deletion activities are properly logged and audited, allowing you to track and investigate any unauthorized or malicious activities. To enable logging and auditing, follow these steps:
   - Open the Azure portal and navigate to the Azure Key Vault service.
   - Select the Key Vaults option from the left-hand menu.
   - Choose the Key Vault where the key deletion without proper logging occurred.
   - In the Key Vault's settings, select the "Diagnostic settings" option.
   - Enable diagnostic settings and configure them to send logs to a storage account or Azure Monitor.
   - Save the changes.

3. Implement access control and monitoring:
   - Regularly review and update access control policies for the Azure Security Service and Key Vault to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete keys.
   - Monitor Key Vault activities and set up alerts for any suspicious or unauthorized deletion attempts.
   - Regularly review Key Vault logs and audit trails to identify any potential security breaches or unauthorized activities.

By following these steps, you can remediate unauthorized deletion and key deletion without proper logging in Azure for AzureSecurityService, enhancing the security and integrity of your system.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate unauthorized deletion in Azure Key Vault using Azure CLI, you can:
   - Enable Azure Key Vault soft delete feature to retain deleted keys for a specified period of time. This can be done using the `az keyvault update` command with the `--enable-soft-delete` flag.
   - Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to ensure that only authorized users or entities have permissions to delete keys from the Key Vault. Use the `az keyvault set-policy` command to assign appropriate access policies to users or groups.

2. To address the issue of key deletion without proper logging in Azure Key Vault using Azure CLI, you can:
   - Enable Azure Key Vault diagnostics logging to capture detailed logs of key deletion activities. This can be done using the `az monitor diagnostic-settings create` command to configure diagnostic settings for the Key Vault.
   - Configure Azure Monitor alerts to notify administrators or security teams when key deletions occur. Use the `az monitor metrics alert create` command to create alerts based on specific criteria, such as the deletion of keys.

3. To mitigate the disruption of encryption and access control caused by key deletion in Azure Key Vault using Azure CLI, you can:
   - Regularly backup and restore keys from the Key Vault to ensure availability and recoverability. Use the `az keyvault key backup` and `az keyvault key restore` commands to perform these operations.
   - Implement a key rotation policy to regularly rotate keys and update applications or services that rely on them. This can be done by generating new keys and updating the necessary configurations using the Azure CLI commands specific to your application or service.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion, key deletion without proper logging, and disruption of encryption and access control in Azure for AzureSecurityService, you can use the following Python scripts:

1. Unauthorized deletion:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users have permissions to delete keys from the Key Vault.
   - Regularly review and update RBAC permissions to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
   - Enable Azure Monitor and set up alerts to notify you of any suspicious activities related to key deletion.

2. Key deletion without proper logging:
   - Enable diagnostic logging for the Key Vault to capture all key deletion events.
   - Use Azure Log Analytics to collect and analyze the logs for auditing purposes.
   - Implement a centralized logging solution to ensure that all key deletion events are properly logged and retained for future investigations.

3. Disruption of encryption and access control:
   - Implement a backup and recovery strategy for the Key Vault to ensure that keys can be restored in case of accidental deletion.
   - Regularly test the backup and recovery process to validate its effectiveness.
   - Implement a key rotation policy to minimize the impact of key deletion by regularly generating new keys and updating the applications or services that rely on them.

Please note that the provided Python scripts are not applicable in this case as the remediation steps involve configuration and management actions in the Azure portal rather than code implementation.
