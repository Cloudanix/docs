### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.KeyVault.vaults.keys.delete event in Azure Security Service refers to the deletion of a key within an Azure Key Vault.
- This event indicates that a key stored in the Key Vault has been permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.
- It is important to monitor this event as it may indicate unauthorized access or accidental deletion of critical keys, which can have significant security implications for the applications and services relying on those keys.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.KeyVault.vaults.keys.delete event is triggered in Azure Security Service, it could indicate that a key within an Azure Key Vault has been deleted. This can have a significant security impact as the deleted key might have been used for encryption, authentication, or other security purposes within an application or infrastructure.

2. Remediation steps:
   - Identify the affected key vault: Use the Azure CLI command `az keyvault list` to list all the key vaults in the subscription and identify the one where the key was deleted.
   - Recover or restore the deleted key: If the key was soft-deleted, you can recover it within a retention period using the Azure CLI command `az keyvault key recover --name <key-name> --vault-name <vault-name>`. If the key was permanently deleted, you will need to restore it from a backup or regenerate a new key.
   - Update applications or services: Once the key is recovered or restored, update any applications or services that rely on the key to use the new or recovered key for encryption or authentication.

3. Preventive measures:
   - Enable soft-delete for key vaults: Soft-delete allows you to recover deleted keys within a retention period. Enable soft-delete for key vaults using the Azure CLI command `az keyvault update --name <vault-name> --enable-soft-delete true`.
   - Enable key vault auditing: Enable auditing for key vaults to track key deletion events. Use the Azure CLI command `az keyvault update --name <vault-name> --set properties.enableVaultAudit=true` to enable auditing.
   - Implement access controls: Ensure that proper access controls are in place to restrict the deletion of keys to authorized personnel only. Regularly review and update access policies for key vaults to minimize the risk of accidental or unauthorized key deletions.
