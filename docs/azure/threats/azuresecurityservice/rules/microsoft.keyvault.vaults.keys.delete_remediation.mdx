### Event Information

- The Microsoft.KeyVault.vaults.keys.delete event in Azure for AzureSecurityService indicates that a key has been deleted from an Azure Key Vault.
- This event signifies that a specific key within a Key Vault has been permanently removed and cannot be recovered.
- It is important to monitor this event as it may indicate potential security breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive cryptographic keys.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with Microsoft.KeyVault.vaults.keys.delete in Azure for AzureSecurityService, it could mean that an unauthorized user or entity has gained access to the Azure Security Service and is able to delete keys from the Key Vault. This could lead to a potential compromise of sensitive data or resources protected by those keys.

2. Data loss or service disruption: Deleting keys from the Key Vault can result in data loss or service disruption, especially if those keys are being used to encrypt or protect critical resources or sensitive information. This could lead to a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the affected data or services.

3. Compliance violations: Deleting keys from the Key Vault without proper authorization or documentation can result in compliance violations, especially if the keys are being used to protect data governed by specific regulations or standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS). This can lead to legal and financial consequences for the organization, as well as damage to its reputation.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion of keys from Azure Key Vault in Azure Security Service using the Azure console, follow these steps:

1. Review and update access controls:
   - Identify and review the existing access controls for the Azure Security Service and the Key Vault.
   - Ensure that only authorized users or entities have the necessary permissions to delete keys from the Key Vault.
   - Remove any unnecessary or excessive permissions that could potentially allow unauthorized deletion.

2. Enable auditing and monitoring:
   - Enable auditing and monitoring for the Key Vault and Azure Security Service.
   - Configure logging and monitoring tools to track and alert on any deletion events or suspicious activities related to the Key Vault.
   - Regularly review the audit logs to identify any unauthorized deletion attempts or suspicious activities.

3. Implement backup and recovery measures:
   - Set up regular backups of the Key Vault and its keys to ensure that data can be restored in case of accidental or unauthorized deletion.
   - Test the backup and recovery process to ensure its effectiveness and reliability.
   - Consider implementing versioning for keys to enable easy recovery in case of accidental deletion.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of keys from Azure Key Vault, minimize data loss or service disruption, and maintain compliance with regulatory standards.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate unauthorized deletion of keys from Azure Key Vault in Azure Security Service, you can take the following steps using Azure CLI commands:

- Identify the unauthorized deletion: Use Azure Monitor or Azure Security Center to detect any suspicious activities related to key deletions in the Key Vault.

- Disable the unauthorized user or entity: Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) to revoke the access of the unauthorized user or entity from the Azure Security Service. You can use the `az ad user delete` or `az ad sp delete` command to delete the user or service principal.

- Implement access controls and monitoring: Review and update the access policies and permissions for the Key Vault to ensure that only authorized users or entities have the necessary permissions to delete keys. Enable auditing and monitoring features in Azure Security Center to track and alert on any future unauthorized deletion attempts.

2. To remediate potential data loss or service disruption caused by key deletions in Azure Key Vault, you can follow these steps using Azure CLI commands:

- Restore deleted keys: If the keys were accidentally deleted, you can restore them from the Key Vault's soft-delete functionality. Use the `az keyvault key recover` command to recover the deleted keys.

- Implement backup and recovery mechanisms: Regularly backup the keys stored in the Key Vault using Azure Key Vault backup and recovery services. This ensures that even if keys are deleted, they can be easily restored from the backups.

- Implement redundancy and failover: Configure Azure Key Vault in a geo-redundant manner to ensure high availability and minimize the impact of service disruptions. This can be done using Azure Traffic Manager or Azure Front Door to route requests to multiple Key Vault instances.

3. To remediate compliance violations related to unauthorized key deletions in Azure Key Vault, you can take the following steps using Azure CLI commands:

- Enable auditing and logging: Enable Azure Key Vault diagnostics logs and Azure Monitor logs to capture all key deletion activities. Use the `az monitor diagnostic-settings create` command to configure the diagnostic settings for the Key Vault.

- Implement access controls and permissions: Ensure that access policies and permissions for the Key Vault are aligned with compliance requirements. Use the `az keyvault set-policy` command to define and enforce access controls for the Key Vault.

- Regularly review and analyze logs: Regularly review the audit logs and monitor for any unauthorized key deletions. Use Azure Log Analytics or Azure Sentinel to analyze the logs and generate alerts for any non-compliant activities.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of keys from Azure Key Vault in Azure Security Service, you can take the following steps:

1. Implement strong access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or entities have the necessary permissions to delete keys from the Key Vault. Use Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to assign appropriate roles and permissions to users and service principals. Regularly review and update access controls to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

2. Enable auditing and monitoring: Enable Azure Key Vault logging and monitoring to track any deletion activities. Configure Azure Monitor to collect and analyze logs related to key deletions. Set up alerts or notifications to promptly detect and respond to any unauthorized deletion attempts.

3. Implement backup and recovery mechanisms: Regularly back up the keys stored in the Key Vault to a secure location. This ensures that even if a key is accidentally or maliciously deleted, it can be restored from the backup. Azure Key Vault provides options for automated backups and recovery, which can be leveraged to minimize the impact of key deletions.

Here's an example Python script that demonstrates how to implement these remediation steps:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.keys import KeyClient
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create Key Vault client
key_client = KeyClient(vault_url="https://your-key-vault-url.vault.azure.net/", credential=credential)

# Enable logging and monitoring for Key Vault
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id="your-subscription-id")
monitor_client.diagnostic_settings.create_or_update(
    resource_uri="your-key-vault-resource-uri",
    parameters={
        "name": "key-vault-logs",
        "storage_account_id": "your-storage-account-id",
        "logs": {
            "category": "AuditEvent",
            "enabled": True
        }
    }
)

# Implement access controls and backup mechanisms as mentioned above

# Code to delete a key from Key Vault
def delete_key(key_name):
    key_client.begin_delete_key(key_name)

# Example usage
delete_key("your-key-name")
```

Please note that you need to replace the placeholders (`your-key-vault-url`, `your-subscription-id`, `your-key-vault-resource-uri`, `your-storage-account-id`, `your-key-name`) with the actual values specific to your Azure environment.
