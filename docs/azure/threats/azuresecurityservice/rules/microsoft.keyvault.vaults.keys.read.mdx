### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.KeyVault.vaults.keys.read event in AzureRealTime for AzureSecurityService refers to the event of reading a key from an Azure Key Vault.
- This event indicates that a user or application has accessed and retrieved a key from the specified Key Vault.
- It is important to monitor this event as it can help track key usage and identify any unauthorized access attempts to the Key Vault.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.KeyVault.vaults.keys.read event in Azure Security Service is compromised, it could indicate unauthorized access or retrieval of encryption keys from an Azure Key Vault. This event could potentially lead to unauthorized decryption of sensitive data or unauthorized access to protected resources.

Remediation:
- Monitor and investigate the event: Review the logs and audit trails to identify the source and extent of the unauthorized access. This will help in understanding the impact and taking appropriate actions.
- Rotate compromised keys: If unauthorized access to encryption keys is confirmed, it is crucial to rotate the compromised keys immediately. This will prevent further unauthorized access and ensure the security of the encrypted data.
- Review and strengthen access controls: Evaluate the access policies and permissions assigned to the Azure Key Vault. Ensure that only authorized users and applications have the necessary permissions to read or manage the keys. Regularly review and update access controls to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

Azure CLI command to rotate a key in Azure Key Vault:
```
az keyvault key rotate --name <key-name> --vault-name <vault-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>
```

2. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.KeyVault.vaults.keys.read event in Azure Security Service is triggered frequently or by unauthorized entities, it could indicate a potential brute-force attack or an attempt to enumerate the keys in the Azure Key Vault. This event could lead to a potential security breach if successful.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access policies: Ensure that the access policies for the Azure Key Vault are properly configured. Use the principle of least privilege and grant access only to the necessary users or applications. Avoid granting excessive permissions that could be exploited.
- Enable Azure Key Vault logging and monitoring: Enable logging and monitoring for the Azure Key Vault to capture and analyze the events. This will help in identifying any suspicious or frequent key read events and take appropriate actions.
- Implement IP restrictions: Restrict access to the Azure Key Vault by configuring IP restrictions. This will limit access to trusted networks or specific IP addresses, reducing the attack surface.

Azure CLI command to configure IP restrictions for Azure Key Vault:
```
az keyvault network-rule add --name <vault-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --ip-address <ip-address>
```

3. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.KeyVault.vaults.keys.read event in Azure Security Service is triggered by a compromised or malicious application, it could indicate an attempt to exfiltrate encryption keys from the Azure Key Vault. This event could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources protected by those keys.

Remediation:
- Review and revoke application permissions: Identify the compromised or malicious application and review its permissions. Revoke any unnecessary or excessive permissions granted to the application. Ensure that only trusted and authorized applications have access to the Azure Key Vault.
- Enable Azure Key Vault soft delete: Enable soft delete for the Azure Key Vault to provide an additional layer of protection. Soft delete allows recovery of deleted keys within a specified retention period, reducing the risk of permanent data loss in case of accidental or malicious deletion.
- Implement application-level security controls: Implement additional security controls within the application itself to prevent unauthorized access or exfiltration of encryption keys. This may include encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit, secure storage of credentials, and regular security assessments of the application.

Azure CLI command to enable soft delete for Azure Key Vault:
```
az keyvault update --name <vault-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --enable-soft-delete true
```
