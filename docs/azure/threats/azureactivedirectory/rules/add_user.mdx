### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Add user" event in Azure Active Directory refers to the action of creating a new user account within the Azure AD tenant.
- This event signifies the addition of a new user to the directory, allowing them to authenticate and access resources within the Azure environment.
- The event can be triggered through various methods, such as using the Azure portal, Azure AD PowerShell module, or programmatically through Azure AD Graph API or Microsoft Graph API.

#### Example

Example of how security can be impacted with an Add user event in Azure Active Directory:

1. Unauthorized user creation: If an attacker gains access to the Azure portal or has compromised user credentials, they can potentially create new user accounts with elevated privileges. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources and data within the Azure environment.

Remediation:
- Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.
- Regularly review and monitor user accounts for any suspicious activity or unauthorized changes.
- Enable Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enforce just-in-time access and reduce the attack surface.

2. Privilege escalation: If an attacker gains access to a low-privileged user account, they may attempt to escalate their privileges by adding themselves or other malicious users to higher privileged groups or roles within Azure Active Directory. This can provide them with unauthorized access to sensitive resources and data.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and audit group and role memberships to ensure they are aligned with the principle of least privilege.
- Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to enforce granular access controls and limit the ability to add users to privileged roles.
- Enable Azure AD Identity Protection to detect and mitigate suspicious activities related to privilege escalation.

3. Data exfiltration: An attacker with access to Azure Active Directory can potentially add a user account and use it to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within Azure resources, such as Azure Storage or Azure SQL Database. They can then exfiltrate this data for malicious purposes.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls and encryption mechanisms for sensitive data stored within Azure resources.
- Regularly monitor and analyze logs and audit trails to detect any unauthorized access attempts or data exfiltration.
- Enable Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel for advanced threat detection and response capabilities.

Note: The provided remediation steps are high-level recommendations. The actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements and configurations of the Azure environment.
