### Event Information

- The Delete group event in Azure Active Directory refers to the action of permanently removing a group from the Azure AD tenant.
- This event signifies that all the associated resources, permissions, and memberships of the group have been deleted and cannot be recovered.
- It is important to note that this event can have significant implications on the access control and collaboration within the Azure AD environment, and should be performed with caution and proper authorization.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of a group: If security is impacted with the Delete group operation in Azure Active Directory, one example could be an unauthorized user gaining access to the Azure portal or API and deleting a group that they should not have access to. This can result in the loss of important group resources, permissions, and potentially compromise the security of the associated applications and data.

2. Accidental deletion of a critical group: Another example could be a scenario where a user with legitimate access accidentally deletes a critical group in Azure Active Directory. This can lead to disruption of business operations, loss of access to important resources, and potential security vulnerabilities if the group was responsible for managing access controls and permissions.

3. Malicious deletion of a group: A third example could be a targeted attack where an attacker gains unauthorized access to an Azure Active Directory account and intentionally deletes a group as part of a larger security breach. This can result in the compromise of sensitive data, unauthorized access to resources, and potential disruption of business operations. It is important to have proper security measures in place, such as multi-factor authentication and access controls, to mitigate the risk of such attacks.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized deletion of a group:
- Step 1: Identify the unauthorized deletion by monitoring Azure Active Directory audit logs or using a third-party monitoring tool.
- Step 2: Immediately revoke the access of the unauthorized user by disabling their account or removing their permissions.
- Step 3: Restore the deleted group from a recent backup or use the Azure Active Directory recycle bin feature to recover the deleted group and its associated resources.
- Step 4: Conduct a thorough investigation to determine how the unauthorized user gained access and take necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future, such as enabling multi-factor authentication and regularly reviewing and updating access control policies.

2. Accidental deletion of a critical group:
- Step 1: Identify the accidental deletion by monitoring Azure Active Directory audit logs or using a third-party monitoring tool.
- Step 2: Restore the deleted group from a recent backup or use the Azure Active Directory recycle bin feature to recover the deleted group and its associated resources.
- Step 3: Communicate with the user who accidentally deleted the group to understand the cause of the incident and provide additional training or guidance to prevent similar accidents in the future.
- Step 4: Implement safeguards such as implementing role-based access control (RBAC) to limit the ability to delete critical groups and regularly backing up Azure Active Directory to minimize the impact of accidental deletions.

3. Malicious deletion of a group:
- Step 1: Immediately revoke the access of the compromised account by disabling the account or removing its permissions.
- Step 2: Restore the deleted group from a recent backup or use the Azure Active Directory recycle bin feature to recover the deleted group and its associated resources.
- Step 3: Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the extent of the attack, identify any other compromised accounts or potential vulnerabilities, and take necessary steps to mitigate the impact and prevent future attacks.
- Step 4: Enhance security measures such as implementing strong password policies, enabling multi-factor authentication, regularly reviewing and updating access control policies, and monitoring Azure Active Directory audit logs for suspicious activities.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion of a group:
- Identify the unauthorized user and revoke their access to the Azure portal or API.
- Restore the deleted group from a backup or use the Azure AD recycle bin feature to recover the group and its associated resources.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access to Azure AD accounts.

2. Accidental deletion of a critical group:
- Restore the deleted group from a backup or use the Azure AD recycle bin feature to recover the group and its associated resources.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit the ability to delete critical groups to only authorized users.
- Regularly review and monitor group changes to quickly identify and rectify accidental deletions.

3. Malicious deletion of a group:
- Immediately revoke the compromised user's access to the Azure portal or API.
- Restore the deleted group from a backup or use the Azure AD recycle bin feature to recover the group and its associated resources.
- Enable Azure AD audit logging and monitor for suspicious activities to detect and respond to any further malicious actions.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of a group in Azure Active Directory, you can take the following steps:

1. Enable Azure AD audit logging: Enable audit logging in Azure Active Directory to track all changes made to groups. This will help you identify any unauthorized deletion of groups and investigate the source of the action. You can enable audit logging using the Azure portal or PowerShell commands.

2. Implement role-based access control (RBAC): Ensure that proper RBAC is in place to restrict access to group management operations. Only authorized users should have the necessary permissions to delete groups. Regularly review and update RBAC assignments to ensure that access is granted based on the principle of least privilege.

3. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA for all user accounts in Azure Active Directory. This adds an extra layer of security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to the Azure portal or API. Even if an attacker gains access to a user's credentials, they would still need the second factor (e.g., a mobile app notification or a hardware token) to complete the authentication process.

Here's an example of a Python script that enables Azure AD audit logging:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.audit import AzureActivityLog

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create the Azure Activity Log client
activity_log_client = AzureActivityLog(credential)

# Enable audit logging for Azure Active Directory
activity_log_client.activity_logs.create_or_update(
    resource_group_name='<resource_group_name>',
    provider_namespace='Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory',
    resource_type='auditservices',
    resource_name='default',
    parameters={
        'properties': {
            'State': 'Enabled'
        }
    }
)
```

Please note that this is just an example and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements and environment.
