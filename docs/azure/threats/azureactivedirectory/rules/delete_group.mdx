### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Delete group" event in Azure Active Directory refers to the action of deleting a group within the Azure AD tenant.
- This event indicates that a group, along with its associated members and permissions, has been permanently removed from the Azure AD environment.
- The event can be triggered by an administrator or by an automated process, and it is important to ensure that proper authorization and access controls are in place to prevent accidental or unauthorized deletions.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with the deletion of a group in Azure Active Directory, it can lead to unauthorized access to resources and potential data breaches. For instance, if a group with elevated privileges is deleted, users who were part of that group may still retain those privileges, posing a security risk.

- Remediation steps using Azure console:
  1. Sign in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) with appropriate credentials.
  2. Navigate to the Azure Active Directory service.
  3. In the left-hand menu, select "Groups" to view the list of groups.
  4. Identify the deleted group from the list or search for it using the search bar.
  5. Select the deleted group to open its properties.
  6. In the group properties, click on the "Restore" button to restore the group.
  7. Once the group is restored, review its membership and ensure that the appropriate users are added back.
  8. Verify that the group's permissions and access rights are correctly configured.
  9. Monitor the group and its associated resources for any unusual activity or unauthorized access.

Note: It is important to have proper access controls and regular backups of Azure Active Directory to mitigate the impact of accidental or malicious deletions. Additionally, implementing RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and regularly reviewing and auditing group memberships can help prevent security issues.

#### Using CLI

1. Example of security impact with Delete group in Azure Active Directory:
   - If a group is deleted in Azure Active Directory, it can result in the loss of access permissions and resources associated with that group. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and disruption of business operations.

2. Remediation for Azure Active Directory using Azure CLI:
   - To remediate the security impact of deleting a group in Azure Active Directory using Azure CLI, you can restore the deleted group within a certain retention period. Here are the CLI commands to achieve this:

   ```
   # List deleted groups within the retention period
   az ad group list-deleted

   # Restore a deleted group using its object ID
   az ad group restore --id <group-object-id>
   ```

   Note: Replace `<group-object-id>` with the actual object ID of the deleted group.

3. Additional considerations:
   - It is important to regularly review and validate the deletion of groups in Azure Active Directory to avoid accidental or unauthorized deletions.
   - Implementing proper access controls, role-based access management, and monitoring mechanisms can help prevent and detect unauthorized deletions of groups in Azure Active Directory.

#### Using Python

- Example of security impact: If a user accidentally deletes a group in Azure Active Directory (AAD), it can lead to the loss of important permissions and access controls associated with that group. This can result in unauthorized access to resources and potential data breaches.

- Remediation steps using Python:
  1. Implement a backup and restore mechanism: Create a script that periodically backs up the Azure Active Directory groups and their associated permissions. This can be achieved using the Azure AD Graph API or Microsoft Graph API in Python. The script should store the backup in a secure location, such as Azure Blob Storage or a separate database.
  
  ```python
  import requests
  import json
  
  # Authenticate and get access token
  # ...
  
  # Get all groups in Azure Active Directory
  url = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups"
  headers = {
      "Authorization": "Bearer " + access_token,
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
  response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
  groups = response.json()
  
  # Backup groups and associated permissions
  backup = []
  for group in groups['value']:
      backup.append(group)
  
  # Store the backup securely (e.g., Azure Blob Storage)
  # ...
  ```
  
  2. Implement access controls and permissions validation: Create a script that regularly checks the existence and permissions of critical groups in Azure Active Directory. This can be done by querying the Azure AD Graph API or Microsoft Graph API in Python. If any discrepancies or unauthorized changes are detected, appropriate actions can be taken, such as restoring from the backup or notifying the administrators.
  
  ```python
  import requests
  import json
  
  # Authenticate and get access token
  # ...
  
  # Get a specific group in Azure Active Directory
  group_id = "<group_id>"
  url = f"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups/{group_id}"
  headers = {
      "Authorization": "Bearer " + access_token,
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
  response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
  group = response.json()
  
  # Validate group permissions and access controls
  if group['securityEnabled'] == False:
      # Group is not security-enabled, take appropriate action
      # ...
  else:
      # Group is security-enabled, validate permissions
      # ...
  ```
  
  3. Implement RBAC and least privilege principles: Ensure that users and service principals have the minimum required permissions to perform group deletion operations in Azure Active Directory. This can be achieved by assigning appropriate roles and permissions using Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) in combination with Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM). Regularly review and audit the assigned roles to minimize the risk of accidental or unauthorized deletions.
  
  ```python
  import requests
  import json
  
  # Authenticate and get access token with appropriate permissions
  # ...
  
  # Delete a specific group in Azure Active Directory
  group_id = "<group_id>"
  url = f"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups/{group_id}"
  headers = {
      "Authorization": "Bearer " + access_token,
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
  response = requests.delete(url, headers=headers)
  
  # Check the response status code for success or failure
  if response.status_code == 204:
      # Group deletion successful
      # ...
  else:
      # Group deletion failed, take appropriate action
      # ...
  ```
