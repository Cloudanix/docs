### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Hard delete service principal event in Azure Active Directory refers to the permanent removal of a service principal object from the directory.
- This event occurs when a service principal is deleted using the "Remove-AzADServicePrincipal" or similar command with the "-Force" parameter, ensuring that the deletion is irreversible.
- It is important to note that this action cannot be undone, and all associated permissions and access granted to the service principal will be permanently revoked.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If a service principal with high privileges is hard deleted in Azure Active Directory, it can potentially impact the security of the Azure environment. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security risks.

- Remediation steps using the Azure portal:
  1. Sign in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) with appropriate credentials.
  2. Navigate to the Azure Active Directory service.
  3. In the left-hand menu, click on "App registrations" or "Enterprise applications" depending on where the service principal was created.
  4. Search for the deleted service principal using the search bar or filters.
  5. Once found, select the deleted service principal.
  6. Click on the "Restore" button to restore the service principal.
  7. Review the restored service principal's permissions and ensure they are appropriate.
  8. If necessary, update the service principal's credentials and access permissions.
  9. Monitor the service principal's activities and consider enabling auditing and logging for better visibility.

Note: It is important to regularly review and manage service principals to prevent security incidents. Additionally, implementing RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and least privilege principles can help mitigate the impact of a hard delete of a service principal.

#### Using CLI

1. Impact of Hard Delete Service Principal in Azure Active Directory:
   - Hard deleting a service principal in Azure Active Directory can have significant security implications. It permanently removes the service principal and all associated credentials, making it impossible to recover or restore them. This can lead to service disruptions, loss of access, and potential security breaches if the service principal was being used for critical operations or access control.

2. Remediation for Azure Active Directory using Azure CLI:
   - To remediate the impact of hard deleting a service principal in Azure Active Directory, you can follow these steps using Azure CLI:

     1. Identify the deleted service principal:
        ```
        az ad sp list --deleted
        ```

     2. Restore the deleted service principal:
        ```
        az ad sp undelete --id <deleted_service_principal_object_id>
        ```

     3. Verify the restoration:
        ```
        az ad sp show --id <restored_service_principal_object_id>
        ```

     Note: The `<deleted_service_principal_object_id>` and `<restored_service_principal_object_id>` should be replaced with the actual object IDs of the deleted and restored service principals, respectively.

3. Additional Considerations:
   - It is important to regularly review and monitor the service principals in your Azure Active Directory to prevent accidental or unauthorized deletions. Implementing proper access controls, role-based access control (RBAC), and multi-factor authentication (MFA) can help mitigate the risk of unauthorized actions. Additionally, maintaining backups or snapshots of critical service principals can provide an additional layer of protection against accidental deletions.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with Hard delete service principal in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):
   - If a service principal is hard deleted in Azure AD, it cannot be recovered or restored. This can lead to potential security risks if the service principal was being used by applications or services for authentication and authorization purposes.
   - Hard deleting a service principal without proper investigation or understanding of its dependencies can result in service disruptions or unauthorized access to resources.

2. Remediation for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) using Python:
   - To remediate the security impact of hard deleting a service principal in Azure AD, it is recommended to follow a cautious approach and perform the following steps:
     1. Identify the dependencies of the service principal: Before deleting the service principal, identify all the applications, services, or resources that rely on it for authentication or authorization.
     2. Revoke access and update dependencies: Once the dependencies are identified, revoke the access granted to the service principal and update the affected applications or services to use an alternative service principal or authentication mechanism.
     3. Soft delete the service principal: Instead of hard deleting the service principal, consider soft deleting it. Soft deletion allows the service principal to be recovered within a certain time frame, providing an additional layer of safety in case of accidental deletion.

3. Python script for soft deleting a service principal in Azure AD:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.graphrbac import GraphRbacManagementClient

   # Authenticate using default credentials
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

   # Create a Graph Rbac Management client
   graph_client = GraphRbacManagementClient(credential, "<your-tenant-id>")

   # Soft delete a service principal
   graph_client.service_principals.delete("<service-principal-object-id>", True)
   ```
   Note: Replace `<your-tenant-id>` with your Azure AD tenant ID and `<service-principal-object-id>` with the object ID of the service principal you want to soft delete.
