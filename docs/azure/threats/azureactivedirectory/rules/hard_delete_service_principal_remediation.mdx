### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Hard delete service principal event in Azure Active Directory refers to the permanent removal of a service principal object from the directory.
- This event signifies that the service principal, which represents an application or service in Azure, has been completely deleted and cannot be recovered.
- It is important to note that this action is irreversible and all associated permissions and access granted to the service principal will be revoked.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If a hard delete service principal event occurs in Azure Active Directory, it can potentially lead to unauthorized access and compromise of resources. This is because service principals are used to authenticate and authorize applications and services to access Azure resources. If a service principal is deleted without proper authorization or by mistake, it can result in the loss of access controls and potentially allow unauthorized entities to gain access to sensitive data or perform malicious actions.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and monitor service principals in Azure Active Directory to identify any unauthorized or unnecessary ones.
- Implement a backup and recovery strategy for service principals to ensure they can be restored if accidentally deleted.
- Enable Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to provide just-in-time access to service principals and enforce approval workflows for their deletion.
- Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to restrict the permissions of service principals and ensure they only have the necessary access to resources.
- Utilize Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center to detect and alert on any suspicious activities related to service principals.

Example CLI command to list service principals in Azure AD:
```
az ad sp list --query "[].{DisplayName:displayName, AppId:appId}"
```

Example CLI command to restore a deleted service principal in Azure AD:
```
az ad sp restore --id <deleted_service_principal_object_id>
```

Note: The above commands require the Azure CLI to be installed and authenticated with appropriate permissions.
