### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Delete group" event in Azure Active Directory refers to the action of deleting a group within the Azure AD tenant.
- This event signifies the removal of a group and all associated members, permissions, and settings from the Azure AD environment.
- It is important to note that this event can have significant implications on access control and collaboration within the organization, and should be carefully managed and monitored to ensure compliance and security.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If a Delete group event occurs in Azure Active Directory, it can potentially lead to unauthorized access or data loss. For instance, if a group containing sensitive resources or permissions is accidentally deleted, it can result in users losing access to those resources or unauthorized individuals gaining access.

Remediation:
- Regularly backup Azure Active Directory to ensure that deleted groups can be restored if needed.
- Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to restrict the ability to delete groups to only authorized individuals.
- Enable Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to require approval and time-bound access for group deletion.
- Monitor and audit group deletion events using Azure Monitor or Azure Sentinel to detect any unauthorized or accidental deletions.

Example CLI command to enable Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM):
```
az ad pim update --id <directory-id> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --enable-group-creation
```

2. Example of security impact: If a malicious actor gains unauthorized access to an account with sufficient privileges, they can perform a Delete group event in Azure Active Directory to disrupt the organization's operations or delete critical resources.

Remediation:
- Implement strong password policies and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts to prevent unauthorized access.
- Regularly review and update user permissions to ensure that only necessary privileges are granted.
- Enable Azure AD Conditional Access policies to enforce additional security controls, such as IP restrictions or device compliance checks.
- Monitor and analyze Azure AD sign-in logs and audit logs to detect any suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.

Example CLI command to enable MFA for a user:
```
az ad user update --id <user-id> --password <new-password> --force-change-password-next-login true
az ad user update --id <user-id> --password <new-password> --password-policies DisablePasswordExpiration
```

3. Example of security impact: If a misconfiguration or vulnerability exists in the Azure Active Directory environment, it can be exploited to perform a Delete group event by an attacker. This can result in the deletion of critical groups, leading to unauthorized access or disruption of services.

Remediation:
- Regularly scan and assess the Azure Active Directory environment for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities using tools like Azure Security Center or Azure Advisor.
- Implement Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enforce just-in-time access and approval workflows for group deletion.
- Enable Azure AD Identity Protection to detect and mitigate suspicious activities or risky sign-ins that could lead to unauthorized group deletions.
- Implement Azure AD Conditional Access policies to restrict access to Azure Active Directory management interfaces based on user location, device, or other factors.

Example CLI command to enable Azure AD Identity Protection:
```
az ad identity-protection update --id <directory-id> --is-enabled true
```
