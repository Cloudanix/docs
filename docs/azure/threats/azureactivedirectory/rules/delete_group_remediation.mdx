### Event Information

- The Delete group event in Azure Active Directory refers to the action of permanently removing a group from the Azure AD tenant.
- This event signifies that a group, along with all its associated members and permissions, has been deleted and can no longer be accessed or used within the Azure AD environment.
- The Delete group event is important for auditing and compliance purposes, as it allows administrators to track and monitor the removal of groups, ensuring proper governance and security measures are in place.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of a group: If security is impacted with the Delete group operation in Azure Active Directory, one example could be an unauthorized user gaining access to the Azure portal or API and deleting a group that they should not have access to. This can result in the loss of important group resources, permissions, and potentially compromise the security of the associated applications and data.

2. Accidental deletion of a critical group: Another example could be a scenario where a user with legitimate access accidentally deletes a critical group in Azure Active Directory. This can lead to disruption of business operations, loss of access to important resources, and potential security vulnerabilities if the group was responsible for managing permissions and access controls.

3. Malicious deletion of a group: A third example could be a targeted attack where an attacker gains unauthorized access to an Azure Active Directory account and intentionally deletes a group to disrupt business operations or gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources. This can result in data breaches, unauthorized access to applications and services, and potential financial and reputational damage to the organization.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized deletion of a group:
- Step 1: Identify the unauthorized deletion by monitoring Azure Active Directory audit logs or using a third-party security monitoring tool.
- Step 2: Immediately revoke the access privileges of the unauthorized user to prevent further unauthorized actions.
- Step 3: Restore the deleted group from a recent backup or use Azure Active Directory's soft delete feature to recover the group and its associated resources.

2. Accidental deletion of a critical group:
- Step 1: Identify the accidental deletion by reviewing Azure Active Directory audit logs or user reports.
- Step 2: Restore the deleted group from a recent backup or use Azure Active Directory's soft delete feature to recover the group and its associated resources.
- Step 3: Implement additional safeguards, such as enabling multi-factor authentication and implementing role-based access controls, to prevent similar accidents in the future.

3. Malicious deletion of a group:
- Step 1: Immediately revoke the compromised user's access privileges and reset their credentials.
- Step 2: Investigate the incident by analyzing Azure Active Directory audit logs and any other available logs to determine the extent of the attack and identify any other compromised accounts or resources.
- Step 3: Restore the deleted group from a recent backup or use Azure Active Directory's soft delete feature to recover the group and its associated resources. Implement additional security measures, such as enabling Azure AD Privileged Identity Management and regularly reviewing and updating access controls, to prevent future attacks.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion of a group:
- Identify the unauthorized user and revoke their access to the Azure portal or API.
- Restore the deleted group from a backup or use the Azure AD recycle bin feature to recover the group and its associated resources.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong access controls to prevent unauthorized access to Azure AD.

2. Accidental deletion of a critical group:
- Use the Azure AD recycle bin feature to restore the deleted group and its associated resources.
- Educate users on the importance of verifying actions before performing them and provide training on how to recover deleted groups.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit the ability to delete critical groups to only authorized users.

3. Malicious deletion of a group:
- Immediately revoke the compromised user's access to the Azure portal or API.
- Investigate the incident to determine the extent of the attack and any potential data breaches.
- Implement security measures such as threat detection, monitoring, and anomaly detection to identify and prevent future attacks.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of a group in Azure Active Directory, you can take the following steps:

1. Enable Azure AD audit logging: Enable Azure AD audit logging to track and monitor all changes made to groups, including deletions. This can be done through the Azure portal or by using Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI commands.

2. Implement role-based access control (RBAC): Ensure that proper RBAC is in place to restrict access to group management operations. Only authorized users should have the necessary permissions to delete groups. Regularly review and update RBAC assignments to ensure that access is granted based on the principle of least privilege.

3. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA for all user accounts with administrative privileges. This adds an extra layer of security and helps prevent unauthorized access to the Azure portal or API, reducing the risk of unauthorized group deletions.

Here's an example of a Python script that can enable Azure AD audit logging:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.audit import AzureActivityLog

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create the Azure Activity Log client
activity_log_client = AzureActivityLog(credential)

# Enable audit logging for Azure AD
activity_log_client.activity_logs.create(
    resource_group_name='<resource_group_name>',
    provider='Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory',
    category='AuditLogs',
    enabled=True
)
```

Please note that you need to install the `azure-identity` and `azure-mgmt-audit` packages for this script to work.
