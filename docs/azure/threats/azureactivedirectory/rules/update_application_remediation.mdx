### Event Information

- The "Update application" event in Azure Active Directory refers to a change made to an application's configuration or settings within the Azure AD environment.
- This event typically occurs when an administrator or developer modifies the properties of an application registered in Azure AD, such as updating the application's display name, changing the redirect URI, or modifying the permissions granted to the application.
- The "Update application" event is important for tracking changes and ensuring the security and compliance of Azure AD applications, as it allows administrators to monitor and audit any modifications made to the application's configuration.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized access: When updating an application in Azure Active Directory, there is a risk of introducing vulnerabilities that could potentially allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources. For example, if the update process does not properly validate user input or enforce proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, it could lead to unauthorized users gaining access to the application.

2. Data breaches: Updating an application in Azure Active Directory without proper security measures can also increase the risk of data breaches. For instance, if the update introduces a vulnerability that allows attackers to exploit the application and gain access to sensitive data, such as user credentials or personally identifiable information, it could result in a data breach.

3. Compliance violations: If security is impacted during the update process, it can lead to compliance violations with various regulatory standards, such as GDPR or HIPAA. For example, if the update introduces a vulnerability that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of sensitive data, it could result in non-compliance with data protection regulations and potentially lead to legal and financial consequences.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate inadequate access controls, vulnerable dependencies, and misconfiguration of security settings in Azure Active Directory (AAD) using the Azure console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Inadequate access controls:
   - Sign in to the Azure portal and navigate to the Azure Active Directory service.
   - Select "App registrations" from the left-hand menu.
   - Locate the application that needs access control remediation and click on it.
   - In the application's overview page, click on "Manifest" to open the application manifest.
   - Review the "appRoles" section and ensure that the assigned roles have appropriate permissions.
   - Make any necessary changes to the access controls, such as removing excessive permissions or adding additional roles.
   - Save the changes to the application manifest.

2. Vulnerable dependencies:
   - Sign in to the Azure portal and navigate to the Azure Active Directory service.
   - Select "App registrations" from the left-hand menu.
   - Locate the application that needs dependency remediation and click on it.
   - In the application's overview page, click on "Authentication" to open the authentication settings.
   - Review the "Redirect URIs" and "Implicit grant" settings to ensure they are properly configured.
   - If any vulnerable dependencies are identified, update the application's code or configuration to use secure and up-to-date dependencies.
   - Test the application to ensure it functions correctly with the updated dependencies.

3. Misconfiguration of security settings:
   - Sign in to the Azure portal and navigate to the Azure Active Directory service.
   - Select "App registrations" from the left-hand menu.
   - Locate the application that needs security settings remediation and click on it.
   - In the application's overview page, click on "Authentication" to open the authentication settings.
   - Review the authentication settings, such as the supported account types, default client type, and advanced settings.
   - Make any necessary changes to the security settings, ensuring they align with best practices and compliance requirements.
   - Save the changes to the authentication settings.

Note: These instructions provide a general guideline for remediating the mentioned issues in Azure Active Directory using the Azure console. The specific steps may vary depending on the exact requirements and configurations of your application. It is recommended to consult Azure documentation and follow best practices for securing Azure Active Directory applications.

#### Using CLI

1. Inadequate access controls: To remediate inadequate access controls in Azure Active Directory (AAD), you can use the Azure CLI to update the application's access permissions. First, identify the application's object ID using the following command:

```
az ad app list --display-name <application_name>
```

Once you have the object ID, you can update the application's permissions using the `az ad app permission` command. For example, to grant the application read access to a specific resource, you can use the following command:

```
az ad app permission add --id <application_object_id> --api <resource_id> --api-permissions <permission_id>=<permission_value>
```

Replace `<application_object_id>`, `<resource_id>`, `<permission_id>`, and `<permission_value>` with the appropriate values for your scenario.

2. Vulnerable dependencies: To remediate vulnerabilities introduced by updating the application in AAD, you should regularly review and update the application's dependencies. You can use the Azure CLI to list the dependencies of the application and check for any known vulnerabilities. For example, you can use the following command to list the dependencies of an application:

```
az ad app show --id <application_object_id> --query "appRoles[].allowedMemberTypes | []"
```

Once you identify any vulnerable dependencies, you should update them to the latest secure versions or consider alternative libraries that do not have known vulnerabilities.

3. Misconfiguration of security settings: To remediate misconfigurations in the security settings of an application in AAD, you can use the Azure CLI to review and update the relevant configurations. For example, you can use the following command to view the authentication settings of an application:

```
az ad app show --id <application_object_id> --query "authentication"
```

Once you identify any misconfigurations, you can update them using the appropriate Azure CLI commands. For example, to update the authentication settings, you can use the `az ad app update` command with the `--set` parameter to modify the desired properties.

Remember to thoroughly test any changes made to ensure they do not introduce new security risks or impact the functionality of the application.

#### Using Python

To remediate inadequate access controls in Azure Active Directory (AAD) using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the application's current access control settings using the Azure AD Graph API or Microsoft Graph API. You can use the `requests` library in Python to make API calls.

```python
import requests

# Make a GET request to retrieve the application's access control settings
response = requests.get('https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/{application_id}/appRoleAssignments',
                        headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer {access_token}'})
access_controls = response.json()
```

2. Review the access control settings and identify any excessive permissions or misconfigurations. You can analyze the `access_controls` JSON response to determine if the application has been granted unnecessary permissions.

3. Update the access control settings to ensure proper access controls. You can use the Azure AD Graph API or Microsoft Graph API to modify the application's permissions. For example, you can remove any unnecessary app role assignments or adjust the application's manifest file.

```python
# Make a PATCH request to update the application's access control settings
response = requests.patch('https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/{application_id}',
                          headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer {access_token}'},
                          json={'appRoles': [{'id': 'role_id', 'allowedMemberTypes': ['User']}])
```

Remember to replace `{application_id}` with the actual ID of the application and `{access_token}` with a valid access token for authentication.

Note: The above code snippets provide a basic outline of the steps involved in remediating inadequate access controls in Azure Active Directory using Python. You may need to modify and adapt the code based on your specific requirements and the Azure AD API version you are using.
