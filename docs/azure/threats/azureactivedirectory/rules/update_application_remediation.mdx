### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Update application" event in Azure Active Directory refers to a change made to an application's configuration or properties within the Azure AD tenant.
- This event typically occurs when an administrator or developer modifies the settings of an application registered in Azure AD, such as updating the application's display name, redirect URIs, permissions, or other attributes.
- The event can be useful for tracking changes and auditing purposes, ensuring that any modifications to the application's configuration are properly recorded and monitored.

#### Example

Example of how security can be impacted with an Update application event in Azure Active Directory:

1. Unauthorized access: If an attacker gains access to the Azure Active Directory and updates an application's permissions or roles, they can potentially grant themselves elevated privileges or access to sensitive data. This can lead to unauthorized access to resources and compromise the security of the system.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and monitor application permissions and roles in Azure Active Directory.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users to prevent unauthorized access.
- Enable Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to manage and control access to privileged roles.
- Implement just-in-time (JIT) access controls to limit the exposure of privileged roles.

2. Malicious code injection: An attacker may exploit an Update application event to inject malicious code into an application's configuration or codebase. This can lead to the execution of unauthorized actions, data breaches, or compromise of the entire system.

Remediation:
- Implement code review processes to detect and prevent malicious code injection.
- Regularly scan applications for vulnerabilities using tools like Azure Security Center or third-party vulnerability scanners.
- Enable Azure AD Conditional Access policies to enforce additional security controls based on user and device context.
- Implement Azure AD Application Proxy to securely publish on-premises applications without exposing them directly to the internet.

3. Data leakage: If an attacker gains access to an application's configuration during an Update application event, they may modify settings that result in data leakage. This can include exposing sensitive data to unauthorized users or making it publicly accessible.

Remediation:
- Implement data loss prevention (DLP) policies to detect and prevent the unauthorized sharing of sensitive data.
- Regularly review and audit application configurations to ensure they align with security best practices.
- Enable Azure AD Identity Protection to detect and respond to suspicious activities related to application configurations.
- Implement Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to monitor and control access to application configurations.

Note: The provided remediation steps are high-level recommendations. The actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements and configurations of the Azure environment.
