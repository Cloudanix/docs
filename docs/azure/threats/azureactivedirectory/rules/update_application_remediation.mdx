### Event Information

- The "Update application" event in Azure Active Directory refers to a change made to an application's configuration or settings within the Azure AD environment.
- This event typically occurs when an administrator or developer modifies the properties of an application registered in Azure AD, such as updating the application's display name, changing the redirect URI, or modifying the permissions granted to the application.
- The "Update application" event is important for tracking changes and ensuring the security and compliance of Azure AD applications, as it allows administrators to monitor and audit any modifications made to the application's configuration.


### Examples

1. Inadequate access controls: Updating the application in Azure Active Directory (AAD) without proper access controls can lead to security risks. For example, if the update grants excessive permissions to the application, it may have access to sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions within the AAD environment.

2. Vulnerable dependencies: Updating the application in AAD may introduce new dependencies or libraries that have security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or compromise the application and its associated resources.

3. Misconfiguration of security settings: Updating the application in AAD without reviewing and configuring the security settings appropriately can result in misconfigurations that impact security. For instance, if the update changes the authentication settings without proper consideration, it may weaken the overall security posture of the application and expose it to potential attacks.

   - Review the dependencies listed under "Redirect URIs" and "Implicit grant" sections.
   - Remove any unnecessary or vulnerable dependencies.
   - Save the changes to the authentication settings.

3. Misconfiguration of security settings:
   - Sign in to the Azure portal and navigate to the Azure Active Directory service.
   - Select "App registrations" from the left-hand menu.
   - Locate the application that needs security settings remediation and click on it.
   - In the application's overview page, click on "Authentication" to configure authentication settings.
   - Review the security settings, such as token lifetimes, multi-factor authentication, and conditional access policies.
   - Make any necessary changes to ensure proper security configuration.
   - Save the changes to the authentication settings.

Note: These instructions provide a general guideline for remediating the mentioned issues in Azure Active Directory using the Azure console. The specific steps may vary depending on the version of Azure portal and the configuration of your environment. It is recommended to consult the official Azure documentation or seek assistance from Azure support for detailed and up-to-date instructions.

#### Using CLI

1. Inadequate access controls: To remediate inadequate access controls in Azure Active Directory (AAD), you can use the Azure CLI commands to update the application's access permissions. 

- First, identify the application that needs to be remediated by running the following command:
  ```
  az ad app list --display-name <application_name>
  ```

- Once you have identified the application, you can update its permissions using the following command:
  ```
  az ad app permission update --id <application_id> --add <permission>
  ```

- Make sure to review and carefully consider the permissions being added to avoid granting excessive access. You can also remove unnecessary permissions using the `--remove` flag in the above command.

2. Vulnerable dependencies: To remediate vulnerable dependencies in Azure Active Directory (AAD), you can update the application's dependencies or libraries to their latest secure versions.

- Identify the vulnerable dependencies by analyzing the application's dependencies using a vulnerability scanning tool or reviewing the dependency manifest file.

- Update the dependencies to their latest secure versions by modifying the dependency manifest file or using package management commands specific to the programming language or framework used by the application.

- Regularly monitor for new vulnerabilities and update the dependencies accordingly to ensure ongoing security.

3. Misconfiguration of security settings: To remediate misconfiguration of security settings in Azure Active Directory (AAD), you can review and update the application's security settings using Azure CLI commands.

- Identify the security settings that need to be remediated by reviewing the application's configuration and security documentation.

- Use the Azure CLI command to update the security settings. For example, to update authentication settings, you can use the following command:
  ```
  az ad app update --id <application_id> --set oauth2AllowImplicitFlow=false
  ```

- Make sure to review and configure the security settings appropriately based on the specific requirements and best practices for your application. Regularly audit and monitor the security settings to ensure ongoing compliance and protection against potential attacks.

#### Using Python

To remediate inadequate access controls in Azure Active Directory (AAD), you can use Python scripts to update the application with proper access controls. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. Retrieve the application details: Use the Azure AD Graph API or Microsoft Graph API to retrieve the details of the application that needs to be updated. You can use the `requests` library in Python to make API calls.

2. Review and update permissions: Analyze the existing permissions assigned to the application and identify any excessive or unnecessary permissions. Use the API to remove or modify these permissions to ensure that the application only has the necessary access rights.

3. Implement role-based access control (RBAC): Use the Azure AD Graph API or Microsoft Graph API to assign appropriate roles to the application. RBAC allows you to grant specific permissions based on predefined roles, reducing the risk of granting excessive access. You can use the `requests` library to make API calls and assign roles to the application.

Here's an example of how you can use Python scripts to update access controls in Azure Active Directory:

```python
import requests
import json

# Retrieve access token using client credentials
token_url = 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}/oauth2/token'
client_id = 'your_client_id'
client_secret = 'your_client_secret'
resource = 'https://graph.windows.net'
tenant_id = 'your_tenant_id'

payload = {
    'grant_type': 'client_credentials',
    'client_id': client_id,
    'client_secret': client_secret,
    'resource': resource
}

response = requests.post(token_url, data=payload)
access_token = response.json()['access_token']

# Retrieve application details
app_id = 'your_application_id'
app_url = f'https://graph.windows.net/{tenant_id}/applications/{app_id}?api-version=1.6'

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get(app_url, headers=headers)
app_details = response.json()

# Update permissions
# Modify the app_details dictionary to remove or modify permissions as needed

# Update application with modified details
response = requests.patch(app_url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(app_details))
```

Please note that you need to replace the placeholders (`your_client_id`, `your_client_secret`, `your_tenant_id`, `your_application_id`) with your actual values. Also, make sure you have the necessary permissions and authentication set up to access the Azure AD Graph API or Microsoft Graph API.
