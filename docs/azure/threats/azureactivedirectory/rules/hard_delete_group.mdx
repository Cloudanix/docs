### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Hard Delete group event in Azure Active Directory refers to the permanent removal of a group from the directory.
- When this event occurs, all associated resources and permissions tied to the group are also permanently deleted.
- This event is irreversible and should be used with caution, as it can result in data loss and impact user access and permissions within the Azure AD environment.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with Hard Delete group in Azure Active Directory, it means that when a group is deleted, it is permanently removed without any possibility of recovery. This can lead to data loss and potential security risks if important groups are accidentally deleted.

- Remediation steps using Azure portal:
  1. Sign in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) with appropriate credentials.
  2. Navigate to the Azure Active Directory service.
  3. In the left-hand menu, click on "Groups" to view the list of groups.
  4. Locate the group that needs to have the Hard Delete option disabled.
  5. Click on the group to open its settings.
  6. In the group settings, click on "Properties" tab.
  7. Under "Delete", toggle the "Hard delete" option to "No" to disable it.
  8. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

- Note: Disabling Hard Delete for groups in Azure Active Directory allows deleted groups to be recoverable within a certain retention period, providing an additional layer of security and data protection.

#### Using CLI

1. Impact of Hard Delete Group in Azure Active Directory on Security:
   - When Hard Delete Group is enabled in Azure Active Directory, it permanently deletes groups and their associated resources without the possibility of recovery. This can have a significant impact on security as it removes the ability to restore accidentally deleted groups or recover important data associated with those groups.

2. Remediation for Azure Active Directory using Azure CLI:
   - To remediate the impact of Hard Delete Group in Azure Active Directory, you can disable the Hard Delete Group feature. This will allow deleted groups to be recoverable within a certain retention period, enhancing security and providing a safety net for accidental deletions.

3. Azure CLI commands to disable Hard Delete Group in Azure Active Directory:
   - To disable Hard Delete Group in Azure Active Directory using Azure CLI, you can use the following commands:

   ```
   # Sign in to Azure CLI
   az login

   # Set the context to the Azure Active Directory tenant
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>

   # Disable Hard Delete Group feature
   az ad feature update --id 8c3fcc1e-0f56-4d1b-8b9b-61fe12e4e24d --disable
   ```

   Note: Replace `<subscription_id>` with the actual subscription ID where the Azure Active Directory is located.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with Hard Delete group in Azure Active Directory:
   - If the Hard Delete group feature is enabled in Azure Active Directory, it allows the permanent deletion of groups without any possibility of recovery. This can lead to accidental or malicious deletion of important groups, resulting in the loss of access control and potential security breaches.

2. Remediation for Azure Active Directory using Python:
   - To remediate the security impact of Hard Delete group in Azure Active Directory using Python, you can implement a script that disables the Hard Delete feature and enforces a soft delete mechanism. Here's an example script:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.graphrbac import GraphRbacManagementClient

# Authenticate to Azure using DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
graph_client = GraphRbacManagementClient(credential, "<your-tenant-id>")

# Get the Azure Active Directory policy
policy = graph_client.policies.get_directory_policy("<your-directory-id>")

# Disable Hard Delete group feature
policy.group_lifetime_in_days = 30  # Set the desired soft delete period
policy.update()

print("Hard Delete group feature disabled successfully.")
```

Note: Make sure to replace `<your-tenant-id>` and `<your-directory-id>` with the appropriate values for your Azure environment.

3. Additional considerations:
   - Before implementing any changes to the Azure Active Directory policy, thoroughly review the impact and ensure it aligns with your organization's security requirements and compliance standards.
   - Regularly monitor and audit group management activities to detect any unauthorized changes or deletions.
   - Consider implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to further enhance the security of Azure Active Directory.
