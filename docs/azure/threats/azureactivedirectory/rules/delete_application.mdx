### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Delete application" event in Azure Active Directory refers to the action of permanently removing an application registration from the Azure AD tenant.
- This event signifies that the application and its associated credentials, permissions, and configurations have been deleted and can no longer be accessed or used.
- It is important to note that deleting an application in Azure AD is an irreversible action and should be performed with caution, as it may impact any services or users relying on the application for authentication or authorization.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with the deletion of an application in Azure Active Directory, it can lead to unauthorized access or loss of data associated with that application. For instance, if a critical application is deleted without proper authorization, it can result in a breach of sensitive information or disruption of business operations.

- Remediation Steps using Azure Console:
  1. Sign in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) using your Azure AD credentials.
  2. Navigate to the Azure Active Directory service by clicking on "Azure Active Directory" in the left-hand menu.
  3. In the Azure Active Directory blade, select "App registrations" under the "Manage" section.
  4. Locate the deleted application from the list of registered applications. You can use the search bar or filter options to find it.
  5. Once you have identified the deleted application, click on it to open the application details.
  6. In the application details page, click on the "Restore" button to restore the deleted application.
  7. Follow the on-screen prompts and confirm the restoration of the application.
  8. After the application is restored, review the application settings and permissions to ensure they are configured correctly.
  9. If necessary, update the access control policies and permissions associated with the application to prevent similar incidents in the future.
  10. Regularly monitor and audit the application registrations in Azure Active Directory to detect any unauthorized changes or deletions.

Note: It is recommended to have proper access controls and permissions in place to prevent unauthorized deletion of applications. Additionally, enabling Azure AD audit logs and monitoring them can help in identifying and investigating any security incidents related to application deletions.

#### Using CLI

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and deletes an application, it can lead to a loss of critical resources and data associated with that application. This can disrupt business operations and compromise the security of the organization's identity and access management.

2. Remediation using Azure CLI: To remediate this security issue in Azure Active Directory using Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

   - Step 1: Identify the deleted application using the Azure CLI command:
     ```
     az ad app list --deleted
     ```

   - Step 2: Restore the deleted application using the Azure CLI command:
     ```
     az ad app restore --id <deleted_application_id>
     ```

   - Step 3: Verify the application is restored by listing all applications:
     ```
     az ad app list
     ```

   By restoring the deleted application, you can regain control over its resources and ensure the security of your Azure AD environment.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions and access to perform these actions.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact: If an application is deleted in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) without proper authorization or validation, it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources. This can result in data breaches, unauthorized account access, or disruption of critical services.

2. Remediation for Azure Active Directory using Python:
   - Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or administrators have the necessary permissions to delete applications in Azure AD. This can be achieved by assigning appropriate roles and permissions using Azure AD RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
   - Enable auditing and monitoring: Enable Azure AD auditing and monitoring features to track and log any application deletion activities. This will help in identifying any unauthorized or suspicious activities and take appropriate actions.
   - Implement automation and validation checks: Use Python scripts to automate the application deletion process while incorporating validation checks. For example, before deleting an application, the script can verify the user's identity, check for proper authorization, and prompt for confirmation. Here's an example Python script using the Azure SDK for Python (azure-identity and azure-graphrbac packages):

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.graphrbac import GraphRbacManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
graph_client = GraphRbacManagementClient(credential, "<your-tenant-id>")

# Define the application ID to be deleted
application_id = "<your-application-id>"

# Check if the user has sufficient permissions to delete the application
permissions = graph_client.applications.list_owned_objects("<your-user-object-id>")
if any(permission.object_id == application_id for permission in permissions):
    # Prompt for confirmation before deleting the application
    confirmation = input("Are you sure you want to delete the application? (y/n): ")
    if confirmation.lower() == "y":
        # Delete the application
        graph_client.applications.delete(application_id)
        print("Application deleted successfully.")
    else:
        print("Application deletion cancelled.")
else:
    print("You do not have sufficient permissions to delete the application.")
```

Please note that you need to install the required packages (`azure-identity` and `azure-graphrbac`) before running the script.
