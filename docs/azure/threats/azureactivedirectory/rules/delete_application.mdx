### Event Information

- The "Delete application" event in Azure Active Directory refers to the action of permanently removing an application registration from the Azure AD tenant.
- This event signifies that the application and its associated credentials, permissions, and configurations have been deleted and can no longer be accessed or used.
- It is important to note that deleting an application in Azure AD is an irreversible action, and it is recommended to carefully review and assess the impact before proceeding with this event.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with the deletion of an application in Azure Active Directory (AAD), one example could be an unauthorized user gaining access to the AAD portal and deleting an application without proper authorization. This could result in the loss of critical data and disruption of services.

2. Data exposure: Another example could be the inadvertent deletion of an application that contains sensitive data. If proper backup and recovery mechanisms are not in place, this could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, potentially violating compliance regulations and compromising the security of the organization.

3. Access control issues: Deleting an application in Azure Active Directory can impact security if it is not properly managed. For example, if an application is deleted without revoking the associated user access permissions, it could result in unauthorized access to resources or data. This can lead to data breaches and compromise the overall security posture of the organization.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion, data exposure, and access control issues in Azure Active Directory (AAD), you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Unauthorized deletion:
   - Enable Azure AD audit logging: Go to the Azure portal, navigate to Azure Active Directory, and select "Audit logs" under "Monitoring". Enable audit logging to track any changes made to applications.
   - Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Assign appropriate roles and permissions to users and groups to ensure that only authorized individuals can access and modify applications.
   - Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for all users accessing the Azure AD portal to add an extra layer of security.

2. Data exposure:
   - Regularly backup critical data: Implement a backup strategy to ensure that sensitive data is regularly backed up and can be restored in case of accidental deletion.
   - Implement data classification and encryption: Classify sensitive data and apply appropriate encryption mechanisms to protect it from unauthorized access.
   - Implement data loss prevention (DLP) policies: Use Azure Information Protection or Azure DLP to detect and prevent the accidental exposure of sensitive data.

3. Access control issues:
   - Review application dependencies: Before deleting an application, identify any dependencies it may have on other resources or users. Ensure that appropriate access controls are in place for these dependencies.
   - Use Azure AD Application Proxy: Instead of deleting an application, consider using Azure AD Application Proxy to disable access to the application while preserving its dependencies and access controls.
   - Regularly review and manage access controls: Conduct periodic reviews of access controls to identify and remove any unnecessary or excessive permissions granted to applications, resources, or users.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of an application in Azure Active Directory (AAD), you can follow these steps using Azure CLI commands:

- Identify the deleted application using the application's object ID or display name:
  `az ad app list --filter "displayName eq '<application_name>'" --query "[].{objectId: objectId}"`

- Restore the deleted application using its object ID:
  `az ad app restore --id <application_object_id>`

- Verify the application has been restored successfully:
  `az ad app show --id <application_object_id>`

2. Data exposure: If a deleted application had access to sensitive data stored in Azure, it is crucial to take immediate action to mitigate data exposure. Here are the steps using Azure CLI commands:

- Identify the deleted application's service principal using the application's object ID or display name:
  `az ad sp list --filter "displayName eq '<application_name>'" --query "[].{objectId: objectId}"`

- Revoke the application's access to sensitive data by removing its role assignments:
  `az role assignment delete --assignee <service_principal_object_id>`

- Monitor and investigate any potential data breaches or unauthorized access to ensure compliance.

3. Access control issues: To address access control issues when deleting an application in AAD, it is important to consider its dependencies and associated access controls. Here are the steps using Azure CLI commands:

- Identify the application's dependencies, such as resources or users, using its object ID:
  `az ad app show --id <application_object_id> --query "requiredResourceAccess[].resourceAppId"`

- Review and update the access controls for the dependent resources or users to ensure they are not impacted by the application's deletion.

- Once the access controls are properly managed, you can safely delete the application using its object ID:
  `az ad app delete --id <application_object_id>`

- Regularly review and manage access controls to prevent unintended access or privilege escalation for entities associated with the application.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion, data exposure, and access control issues in Azure Active Directory (AAD), you can use Python scripts to automate the process. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. Unauthorized deletion:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to the AAD portal. Only authorized users should have permissions to delete applications.
   - Monitor and log all activities in the AAD portal, including application deletions. Use Azure Monitor or Azure Sentinel to set up alerts for any unauthorized deletion attempts.
   - Create a Python script that periodically checks for deleted applications and restores them if necessary. You can use the Azure AD Graph API or Microsoft Graph API to retrieve the list of deleted applications and restore them programmatically.

2. Data exposure:
   - Encrypt sensitive data stored in Azure using Azure Key Vault or Azure Storage Service Encryption. This ensures that even if an application is deleted, the data remains protected.
   - Implement data classification and labeling to identify sensitive data and apply appropriate access controls. Use Azure Information Protection or Azure Data Classification to automatically classify and protect sensitive data.
   - Regularly backup critical data stored in Azure to a separate location or storage account. This ensures that even if an application is deleted, you can restore the data from the backup.

3. Access control issues:
   - Before deleting an application, review its dependencies and associated access controls. Identify any resources or users that rely on the application's permissions.
   - Use the Azure AD Graph API or Microsoft Graph API to retrieve the list of resources and users with permissions granted by the application.
   - Update the permissions or reassign them to another application or user before deleting the original application. This ensures that there are no unintended access or privilege escalation issues.

Note: The provided steps are high-level guidelines. You may need to customize the Python scripts based on your specific requirements and environment.
