### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Delete application" event in Azure Active Directory refers to the action of permanently removing an application registration from the Azure AD tenant.
- This event signifies that the application and its associated credentials, permissions, and configurations have been deleted and can no longer be accessed or used.
- It is important to note that deleting an application in Azure AD is an irreversible action, and all data and access associated with the application will be lost. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the application is no longer needed before performing this action.

#### Example

Example of how security can be impacted with a Delete application event in Azure Active Directory:

1. Unauthorized deletion: If an attacker gains access to the Azure Active Directory and deletes an application, it can lead to a potential security breach. This can result in the loss of critical data, unauthorized access to resources, and disruption of services.

2. Data loss: Deleting an application in Azure Active Directory can result in the loss of associated data, such as user information, access permissions, and configuration settings. This can have a significant impact on the organization's operations and may require extensive recovery efforts.

3. Unauthorized access: Deleting an application can remove the associated access controls and permissions. This can potentially allow unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive resources or perform malicious activities within the organization's environment.

Remediation:

1. Enable auditing and monitoring: Implement auditing and monitoring mechanisms to track changes made to Azure Active Directory applications. This can help detect and investigate any unauthorized deletion events promptly.

2. Implement access controls: Ensure that proper access controls are in place to restrict the ability to delete applications in Azure Active Directory. Only authorized personnel should have the necessary permissions to perform such actions.

3. Regular backups and recovery: Regularly backup the Azure Active Directory applications and associated data. This will enable quick recovery in case of accidental or malicious deletion. Azure provides the ability to backup and restore applications using Azure AD PowerShell module. Here's an example of a PowerShell script to backup an application:

```powershell
Connect-AzureAD
$application = Get-AzureADApplication -Filter "DisplayName eq 'YourApplicationName'"
Backup-AzureADApplication -ObjectId $application.ObjectId -FilePath "C:\Backup\YourApplicationBackup.json"
```

Note: Replace 'YourApplicationName' with the actual name of the application and specify the desired backup file path.
