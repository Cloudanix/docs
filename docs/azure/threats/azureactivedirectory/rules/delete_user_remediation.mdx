### Event Information

- The "Delete user" event in Azure Active Directory refers to the action of permanently removing a user account from the Azure AD tenant.
- This event indicates that a user account has been deleted and will no longer have access to any resources or services associated with the Azure AD tenant.
- The "Delete user" event can be useful for auditing and tracking purposes, as it allows administrators to monitor user account deletions and ensure that proper access controls are being followed.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with the "Delete user" action in Azure Active Directory, one example could be an unauthorized user gaining access to administrative privileges and deleting user accounts without proper authorization. This can lead to data loss, disruption of services, and potential security breaches.

2. Data loss: Another example could be accidental or malicious deletion of user accounts that results in the loss of important data associated with those accounts. This can include sensitive information such as personal identifiable information (PII), access credentials, and other critical data that can be used for unauthorized access or identity theft.

3. Service disruption: Deleting a user account in Azure Active Directory can also impact the availability and functionality of various services and applications that rely on that user account for authentication and authorization. This can lead to service disruptions, loss of productivity, and potential financial implications for the organization. It is important to carefully manage user account deletions to avoid unintended consequences.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion in Azure Active Directory using the Azure console, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement access controls:
   - Ensure that only authorized users have administrative privileges in Azure Active Directory.
   - Regularly review and update user roles and permissions to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):
   - Enable MFA for all user accounts in Azure Active Directory to add an extra layer of security.
   - This will help prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to administrative privileges and deleting user accounts.

3. Enable auditing and monitoring:
   - Enable auditing and monitoring features in Azure Active Directory to track and detect any unauthorized deletion activities.
   - Regularly review audit logs and monitor for any suspicious or unusual activities related to user account deletions.

4. Implement regular backups:
   - Regularly backup user account data and associated information to prevent data loss in case of accidental or malicious deletion.
   - Use Azure Backup or other backup solutions to automate the backup process and ensure data integrity.

5. Define a user account deletion process:
   - Establish a well-defined process for deleting user accounts in Azure Active Directory.
   - This process should include proper authorization and documentation, ensuring that only authorized personnel can perform user account deletions.
   - Maintain audit trails of all user account deletion activities for accountability and traceability.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized deletion in Azure Active Directory and ensure the security and availability of your cloud environment.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unauthorized deletion in Azure Active Directory using Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have administrative privileges and access to perform user deletion actions. Use Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to assign appropriate roles and permissions to users.

2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for all administrative accounts to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access to user deletion actions. You can enable MFA using the Azure CLI with the following command:

   ```
   az ad user update --id <user-id> --force-change-password-next-login true
   ```

3. Enable auditing and monitoring: Enable Azure Active Directory auditing to track and monitor user deletion activities. This will help in detecting any unauthorized or suspicious actions. You can enable auditing using the Azure CLI with the following command:

   ```
   az ad diagnostic-settings create --name <diagnostic-settings-name> --resource <resource-id> --logs '[{"category": "AuditLogs", "enabled": true}]'
   ```

By implementing these measures, you can mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized deletion in Azure Active Directory and ensure the security and integrity of user accounts and data.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion in Azure Active Directory using Python, you can utilize the Azure AD Graph API to implement access controls and monitoring mechanisms. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. Implement access controls:
   - Use the Azure AD Graph API to retrieve the list of users and their permissions.
   - Identify and remove any unauthorized administrative privileges assigned to user accounts.
   - Regularly review and update access control policies to ensure only authorized users have the necessary permissions.

2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):
   - Use the Azure AD Graph API to enable MFA for user accounts.
   - Implement MFA policies that require additional verification steps for critical actions like user deletion.
   - Regularly monitor MFA usage and enforce MFA for all privileged accounts.

3. Implement monitoring and alerting:
   - Use the Azure AD Graph API to monitor user account activities, including deletions.
   - Set up alerts or notifications for any suspicious or unauthorized deletion activities.
   - Implement logging and auditing mechanisms to track user account deletions and identify potential security breaches.

Please note that the Azure AD Graph API is being deprecated, and Microsoft recommends using Microsoft Graph API for new development. You can find Python code examples and documentation for working with Azure AD using Python on the Microsoft Graph API documentation website.
