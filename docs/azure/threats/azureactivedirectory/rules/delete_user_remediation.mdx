### Event Information

- The "Delete user" event in Azure Active Directory refers to the action of permanently removing a user account from the Azure AD tenant.
- This event indicates that a user account has been deleted and will no longer have access to any resources or services associated with the Azure AD tenant.
- The "Delete user" event can be triggered by an administrator or by an automated process, such as when a user account is no longer needed or when an employee leaves the organization.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized Deletion: If security is impacted with the "Delete user" action in Azure Active Directory, one example could be an unauthorized user gaining access to the Azure portal and deleting a user account without proper authorization. This could result in the loss of important data and disruption of business operations.

2. Data Breach: Another example could be if a user account with elevated privileges is compromised, an attacker could use the "Delete user" action to delete multiple user accounts, potentially leading to a data breach. This could result in the exposure of sensitive information and compromise the security and privacy of the affected users.

3. Impact on Access Controls: Deleting a user account without proper consideration can also impact access controls within the organization. For example, if a user account with administrative privileges is deleted, it could result in the loss of access to critical resources and services, leading to operational disruptions and potential security vulnerabilities. It is important to carefully manage user deletion to ensure that access controls are properly maintained.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion, lack of audit trail, and inadequate access controls in Azure Active Directory, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Unauthorized deletion:
   - Implement strong authentication measures: Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts to prevent unauthorized access to the Azure portal.
   - Regularly review and update user roles and permissions: Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to perform actions like "Delete user."
   - Enable activity logs and alerts: Configure Azure Monitor to track and alert on any suspicious activities related to user deletions.

2. Lack of audit trail:
   - Enable Azure AD audit logging: Go to the Azure portal, navigate to Azure Active Directory, and enable audit logging for user deletion events.
   - Configure log retention: Set up a log retention policy to retain audit logs for an appropriate duration, considering compliance requirements.
   - Regularly review audit logs: Periodically review the audit logs to identify any unauthorized or suspicious user deletion events.

3. Inadequate access controls:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC): Define and assign roles with appropriate permissions to users based on their responsibilities.
   - Regularly review and update access controls: Conduct periodic reviews of user roles and permissions to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.
   - Enable just-in-time (JIT) access: Utilize Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to grant temporary, time-bound access to perform critical actions like user deletion.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized deletion, lack of audit trail, and inadequate access controls in Azure Active Directory.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion in Azure Active Directory, you can follow these steps using Azure CLI commands:

- Identify the user account that was deleted without authorization:
  `az ad user list --query "[?userPrincipalName=='<user_principal_name>']"`

- Restore the deleted user account:
  `az ad user undelete --upn-or-object-id <user_principal_name_or_object_id>`

- Review and update access controls:
  Ensure that proper access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized users from performing the "Delete user" action. This includes regularly reviewing and updating user roles and permissions.

2. Lack of audit trail: To remediate the lack of audit trail for user deletion events in Azure Active Directory, you can:

- Enable Azure Active Directory audit logging:
  `az ad diagnostic-settings create --name <diagnostic_settings_name> --resource <azure_ad_resource_id> --logs '[{"category": "AuditLogs", "enabled": true}]'`

- Monitor and analyze audit logs:
  Use Azure Monitor or other log analysis tools to monitor and analyze the audit logs generated by Azure Active Directory. This will help in tracking and investigating any suspicious or malicious activities related to user deletions.

3. Inadequate access controls: To remediate inadequate access controls in Azure Active Directory, you can:

- Review and update user roles and permissions:
  `az ad user list --query "[?userPrincipalName=='<user_principal_name>']"`
  `az ad user update --id <user_object_id> --add <role_id>`

- Implement just-in-time access:
  Consider implementing just-in-time access controls, such as Azure AD Privileged Identity Management, to limit the duration and scope of user permissions. This helps in reducing the risk of unauthorized users performing the "Delete user" action.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion, lack of audit trail, and inadequate access controls in Azure Active Directory using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. Unauthorized deletion:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict the permissions of users and ensure that only authorized individuals have the ability to delete user accounts.
   - Use the Azure AD PowerShell module in your Python script to manage user accounts and their permissions. You can use the `Remove-AzureADUser` cmdlet to delete a user account, but make sure to validate the user's authorization before executing the command.

2. Lack of audit trail:
   - Enable Azure AD audit logging to capture user deletion events. You can use the Azure AD PowerShell module to configure audit settings using the `Set-AzureADAuditDirectorySetting` cmdlet.
   - Retrieve and analyze the audit logs using the `Get-AzureADAuditDirectoryLogs` cmdlet in your Python script. You can filter the logs based on the deletion events and perform further analysis or alerting as needed.

3. Inadequate access controls:
   - Regularly review and update user roles and permissions to ensure that only authorized users have the ability to delete user accounts.
   - Use the Azure AD Graph API in your Python script to programmatically manage user roles and permissions. You can use the `PATCH` method to update the user's `assignedRoles` property and remove the ability to delete user accounts.

Please note that the provided steps are high-level and may require additional customization based on your specific requirements and environment.
