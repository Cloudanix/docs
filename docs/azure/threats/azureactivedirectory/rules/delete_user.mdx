### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Delete user" event in Azure Active Directory refers to the action of permanently removing a user account from the Azure AD tenant.
- This event signifies that a user's account and associated data, such as group memberships, access permissions, and application assignments, have been deleted.
- It is important to monitor and track "Delete user" events in Azure Active Directory to ensure proper user lifecycle management and to maintain data security and compliance.

#### Example

Example of how security can be impacted with a Delete user event in Azure Active Directory:

1. Unauthorized deletion: If an attacker gains access to a privileged account or compromises a user's credentials with sufficient permissions, they can delete user accounts in Azure Active Directory. This can lead to unauthorized access to resources, data loss, and disruption of business operations.

Remediation:
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) to protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
- Regularly review and update user permissions to ensure that only necessary privileges are granted.
- Enable auditing and monitoring of user activities in Azure Active Directory to detect and respond to suspicious behavior.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit the number of users with administrative privileges.

2. Malicious insider threat: An insider with legitimate access to Azure Active Directory may intentionally delete user accounts to cause harm or disrupt operations. This can result in data loss, service interruptions, and potential security breaches.

Remediation:
- Implement a least privilege principle, granting users only the permissions necessary to perform their job functions.
- Regularly review and monitor user activities, especially those with administrative privileges.
- Enable Azure Active Directory's soft delete feature, which allows for recovery of deleted users within a specified retention period.
- Implement a robust identity and access management (IAM) strategy, including regular access reviews and revocation of unnecessary privileges.

3. Accidental deletion: Human error or misconfiguration can lead to accidental deletion of user accounts in Azure Active Directory. This can result in data loss, disruption of services, and impact on user productivity.

Remediation:
- Implement backup and recovery mechanisms for Azure Active Directory, such as Azure AD Connect with password writeback, to restore deleted user accounts.
- Regularly train and educate administrators and users on best practices for managing user accounts and avoiding accidental deletions.
- Enable Azure Active Directory's recycle bin feature, which allows for recovery of deleted users within a specified retention period.
- Implement change management processes and controls to ensure that user account deletions are properly authorized and documented.

Note: The provided remediation steps are general recommendations and may need to be adapted based on specific organizational requirements and compliance standards.
