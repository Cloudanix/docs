### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Delete user" event in Azure Active Directory refers to the action of permanently removing a user account from the Azure AD tenant.
- This event indicates that a user account has been deleted and will no longer have access to any resources or services associated with the Azure AD tenant.
- The "Delete user" event can be useful for auditing and tracking purposes, as it allows administrators to monitor user account deletions and ensure that proper access controls are being followed.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with the "Delete user" action in Azure Active Directory, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access or data loss if a user account is mistakenly deleted or intentionally compromised.

- Remediation steps using the Azure portal:
  1. Sign in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) with appropriate credentials.
  2. Navigate to the Azure Active Directory service.
  3. Select "Users" from the left-hand menu to view the list of users.
  4. Locate the user that needs to be deleted and select it.
  5. In the user details page, click on the "Delete" button.
  6. A confirmation dialog will appear, asking for confirmation to delete the user. Review the details and click "Delete" to proceed.
  7. Optionally, you can choose to reassign the user's resources to another user or delete the user's resources as well.
  8. Once the user is deleted, ensure that any associated permissions, access rights, or resources are appropriately adjusted to maintain security and compliance.

Note: It is crucial to follow the principle of least privilege and ensure that only authorized individuals have the necessary permissions to perform user deletion actions. Additionally, enabling multi-factor authentication and regularly reviewing user access can help mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletions.

#### Using CLI

1. Example of security impact: When a user is deleted in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), it can lead to potential security risks such as unauthorized access to resources, data loss, and disruption of business operations. This is because the deleted user's access permissions and privileges may still be active in various Azure services and applications.

2. Remediation using Azure CLI: To remediate the security impact of deleting a user in Azure Active Directory, you can follow these steps using Azure CLI:

   a. Identify the user's Object ID: Retrieve the Object ID of the user you want to delete by running the following command:
      ```
      az ad user show --upn-or-object-id <user-upn-or-object-id> --query objectId --output tsv
      ```

   b. Revoke user's tokens: To ensure the deleted user's active sessions are terminated, revoke their tokens by running the following command:
      ```
      az rest --method post --uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/<user-object-id>/revokeSignInSessions"
      ```

   c. Delete the user: Finally, delete the user from Azure Active Directory using the following command:
      ```
      az ad user delete --upn-or-object-id <user-upn-or-object-id>
      ```

   Note: Replace `<user-upn-or-object-id>` with the actual user's UPN (User Principal Name) or Object ID.

3. Additional considerations:
   - It is important to ensure that the user's access to all Azure resources and applications is properly revoked or reassigned before deleting the user.
   - Regularly review and audit user access permissions to identify and mitigate any potential security risks.

#### Using Python

- Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Azure Active Directory and deletes a user, it can lead to unauthorized access to resources, data loss, and disruption of business operations.

- Remediation for Azure Active Directory using Python:
  1. Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete users in Azure Active Directory.
  2. Monitor and log all user deletion activities in Azure Active Directory using Azure Monitor or Azure Log Analytics.
  3. Implement automated alerts and notifications to promptly detect and respond to any unauthorized user deletion activities.

Python script example to remediate this issue by implementing RBAC:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.authorization import AuthorizationManagementClient

# Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create AuthorizationManagementClient
authorization_client = AuthorizationManagementClient(credential, <subscription_id>)

# Define the role assignment
role_assignment = {
    'properties': {
        'role_definition_id': '/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/<role_definition_id>',
        'principal_id': '<principal_id>',
        'scope': '/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group_name>/providers/Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory/<directory_name>'
    }
}

# Create the role assignment
authorization_client.role_assignments.create(
    scope='/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group_name>/providers/Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory/<directory_name>',
    role_assignment_name='<role_assignment_name>',
    parameters=role_assignment
)
```

Note: Replace `<subscription_id>`, `<role_definition_id>`, `<principal_id>`, `<resource_group_name>`, and `<directory_name>` with the appropriate values for your Azure environment.
