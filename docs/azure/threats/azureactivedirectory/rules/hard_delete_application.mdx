### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Hard Delete" application event in Azure Active Directory refers to the permanent removal of an application from the directory.
- When an application is hard deleted, all associated data and configurations are permanently erased and cannot be recovered.
- This event is typically triggered when an administrator explicitly chooses to delete an application, either through the Azure portal or using the Azure AD PowerShell module.

#### Example

Example of how security can be impacted with a Hard Delete application event in Azure Active Directory:

1. Accidental deletion: If a user with sufficient permissions accidentally deletes an application in Azure Active Directory, it can lead to security issues. This can happen due to human error or lack of proper access controls.

2. Unauthorized access: If an attacker gains access to an account with sufficient permissions, they can intentionally delete an application to disrupt the organization's operations or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

3. Data loss: When an application is hard deleted, all associated data, configurations, and permissions are permanently removed. This can result in data loss and impact the organization's ability to function properly.

Remediation:

1. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete applications in Azure Active Directory. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit the number of users with such permissions.

2. Enable soft delete: Azure Active Directory provides a feature called "soft delete" that allows applications to be recovered within a specified retention period. Enable this feature to provide an additional layer of protection against accidental or malicious deletions.

3. Regular backups: Take regular backups of critical applications and their configurations. This will help in restoring the application and its associated data in case of accidental deletion.

Azure CLI command to enable soft delete for Azure Active Directory applications:

```
az ad feature show --id 501c3e99-42be-4aaf-8874-xxxxxxxxxxxx --query "isEnabled"
```

Azure PowerShell command to enable soft delete for Azure Active Directory applications:

```
Set-AzureADMSDeletedDirectoryObject -Id <applicationId> -Restore
```

Note: Replace `<applicationId>` with the actual ID of the deleted application.
