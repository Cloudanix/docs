### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The "Change user password" event in Azure Active Directory refers to the action of modifying the password for a user account in the Azure AD tenant.
2. This event is typically triggered when an administrator or the user themselves initiates a password change for their account.
3. The event provides visibility and auditability of password changes, allowing administrators to track and monitor password-related activities for security and compliance purposes.

#### Example

Example of how security can be impacted with a Change user password event in Azure Active Directory:

1. Weak Passwords: If a user sets a weak password during the password change event, it can make the account vulnerable to brute-force attacks or password guessing. This can lead to unauthorized access to the user's account and potentially compromise sensitive data.

Remediation: Encourage users to follow strong password guidelines, such as using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Implement password complexity policies and enforce regular password changes. You can use Azure AD PowerShell module to enforce password policies:

```powershell
Set-MsolPasswordPolicy -ValidityPeriod "90" -NotificationDays "14" -NotificationBeforePasswordExpires "7" -PasswordHistoryCount "5" -MinPasswordLength "8" -MinPasswordAge "1"
```

2. Password Reuse: If a user reuses their old password or sets a password that has been previously compromised, it increases the risk of unauthorized access. Attackers often target reused passwords across multiple accounts.

Remediation: Implement a password history policy that prevents users from reusing their previous passwords. This can be done using Azure AD PowerShell module:

```powershell
Set-MsolPasswordPolicy -PasswordHistoryCount "5"
```

3. Password Reset Vulnerabilities: If the password change event triggers a password reset process that is vulnerable to exploitation, it can lead to unauthorized access. For example, if the password reset process relies solely on email verification, an attacker with access to the user's email account can reset the password and gain unauthorized access.

Remediation: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security during the password reset process. This can be done using Azure AD Conditional Access policies. Additionally, consider using alternative methods for password reset, such as SMS verification or security questions.

Note: The provided examples are based on Azure AD PowerShell module commands. Make sure to install and import the module before running the commands.
