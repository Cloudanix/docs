### Event Information

- The "User deleted security info" event in Azure Active Directory refers to an action taken by a user to delete their security information associated with their account.
- This event indicates that the user has removed or deleted one or more security factors such as phone numbers, email addresses, or security questions from their account.
- It is important to monitor and investigate this event as it may indicate a potential compromise or unauthorized access to the user's account, as an attacker may attempt to remove security information to make it harder for the legitimate user to regain control.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized access: When a user deletes their security info in Azure Active Directory, it can potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources. For example, if a user's multi-factor authentication (MFA) settings are deleted, it removes an additional layer of security, making it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access to the user's account and any associated resources.

2. Data breaches: Deleting security info in Azure Active Directory can increase the risk of data breaches. For instance, if a user deletes their password reset options or security questions, it becomes easier for an attacker to reset the user's password and gain access to their account and any data stored within it.

3. Compliance violations: Deleting security info without proper documentation or audit trails can lead to compliance violations. Compliance standards often require organizations to maintain a record of security-related changes and actions. If a user deletes their security info without proper documentation, it can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements, potentially leading to penalties or legal consequences.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized access: To remediate unauthorized access resulting from the deletion of security info in Azure Active Directory, follow these steps:

- Enable auditing: Enable auditing for Azure Active Directory to track changes made to security info. This can be done through the Azure portal by navigating to Azure Active Directory > Monitoring > Audit logs and enabling the necessary audit events.
- Set up alerts: Configure alerts to notify administrators when security info is deleted. This can be done using Azure Monitor and Azure Logic Apps to create a workflow that triggers an alert when specific audit events related to security info deletion are detected.
- Implement conditional access policies: Use conditional access policies to enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users, even if their MFA settings are deleted. This ensures an additional layer of security and mitigates the risk of unauthorized access.

2. Data breaches: To remediate the risk of data breaches resulting from the deletion of security info in Azure Active Directory, follow these steps:

- Implement data encryption: Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Use Azure Key Vault to securely store encryption keys and certificates, and configure appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized deletion.
- Regularly backup encryption keys: Regularly back up encryption keys and certificates to a secure location. This ensures that even if security info is accidentally deleted, the encrypted data can still be accessed and decrypted using the backup keys.
- Monitor for unusual activity: Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect any unusual activity related to data encryption and decryption. This can help identify potential data breaches and take immediate action to mitigate the impact.

3. Compliance violations: To remediate compliance violations resulting from the deletion of security info in Azure Active Directory, follow these steps:

- Implement access controls and permissions: Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete security info. Use Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to assign appropriate roles and permissions to users and regularly review and update these permissions.
- Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for Azure Active Directory and retain the logs for the required duration as per regulatory standards. This helps in maintaining a record of security-related changes and provides evidence of compliance.
- Implement change management processes: Establish proper change management processes that require documentation and approval for any changes to security info. This ensures that all changes are properly authorized, documented, and aligned with compliance requirements.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations related to deleting security info in Azure Active Directory, you can take the following steps using Azure CLI:

1. Unauthorized access:
- Monitor and log security-related events in Azure Active Directory using Azure Monitor. This will help you detect any unauthorized access attempts.
- Implement conditional access policies to enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive resources. This will add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access even if security info is deleted.
- Regularly review and audit user accounts to ensure that security info is not deleted without proper authorization.

2. Data breaches:
- Enable Azure Key Vault to securely store encryption keys and certificates. This will prevent users from deleting these critical security components.
- Implement data loss prevention (DLP) policies to classify and protect sensitive data. This will help prevent accidental exposure of encrypted data even if security info is deleted.
- Regularly backup and monitor your encrypted data to detect any unauthorized access or changes.

3. Compliance violations:
- Enable Azure Active Directory auditing to track and record security-related changes. This will help you maintain proper documentation and audit trails.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can delete security info.
- Regularly review and validate compliance requirements for your organization and ensure that security controls are properly documented and followed.

Please note that the specific CLI commands may vary depending on your Azure setup and requirements. It is recommended to refer to the Azure CLI documentation for detailed command usage and syntax.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations related to deleting security info in Azure Active Directory, you can take the following steps using Python:

1. Unauthorized access:
   - Monitor and log security info changes: Implement Azure Monitor to track changes made to security info in Azure Active Directory. You can use the Azure Monitor Python SDK to retrieve and analyze the logs.
   - Set up alerts: Configure Azure Monitor alerts to notify you when security info is deleted or modified. This can help you detect potential unauthorized access quickly.
   - Implement conditional access policies: Use the Azure Active Directory Python SDK to enforce conditional access policies, such as requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) for specific users or roles.

2. Data breaches:
   - Backup and restore security info: Regularly back up security info, including encryption keys and certificates, to prevent data loss. You can use the Azure Key Vault Python SDK to manage and restore encryption keys.
   - Implement data encryption: Encrypt sensitive data using Azure Key Vault and manage encryption keys securely. The Azure Key Vault Python SDK provides functions to encrypt and decrypt data.
   - Monitor data access: Utilize Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics to monitor data access patterns and detect any unusual or unauthorized access attempts.

3. Compliance violations:
   - Implement audit logging: Enable Azure Active Directory audit logging to capture security info changes. Use the Azure Monitor Python SDK to retrieve and analyze audit logs for compliance purposes.
   - Maintain documentation: Ensure that all security info changes are properly documented, including the reason for the change and the authorized personnel involved. You can use Python to automate the documentation process and store the information in a secure location.
   - Regularly review and validate security controls: Conduct periodic reviews of security controls to ensure they align with compliance requirements. Use the Azure Policy Python SDK to enforce and validate compliance policies.

Please note that the provided steps are high-level guidelines, and you may need to adapt them based on your specific requirements and environment.
