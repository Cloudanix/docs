### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "User deleted security info" event in Azure Active Directory refers to an action taken by a user to delete their security information, such as passwords or security questions, associated with their account.
- This event indicates that the user has intentionally removed their security information, which can have implications for the security and access control of their account.
- It is important to monitor and investigate this event to ensure that the user's account remains secure and to take appropriate actions, such as resetting passwords or enabling multi-factor authentication, if necessary.

#### Example

1. Example: If a user accidentally or maliciously deletes security information in Azure Active Directory (AAD), it can impact the security of the organization. For instance, if a user deletes a security group that controls access to sensitive resources, unauthorized users may gain access to those resources.

Remediation:
- Restore the deleted security information from a backup or a previous state, if available.
- If a backup is not available, recreate the security information with the same settings and permissions as before the deletion.
- Monitor the affected resources for any unauthorized access or suspicious activities.
- Educate users about the importance of not deleting security information without proper authorization or understanding of the consequences.

Azure CLI Command to restore a deleted security group:
```
# Get the deleted security group object ID
deleted_group_id=$(az ad group list --filter "isSoftDeleted eq true" --query "[].objectId" -o tsv)

# Restore the deleted security group
az ad group restore --id $deleted_group_id
```

2. Example: Another scenario where security can be impacted is if a user deletes their own security information, such as their multi-factor authentication (MFA) settings. This can potentially allow unauthorized access to their account if an attacker gains access to their credentials.

Remediation:
- Prompt the user to reconfigure their security settings, including enabling MFA again.
- Monitor the user's account for any suspicious activities or unauthorized access.
- Consider implementing additional security measures, such as conditional access policies or IP restrictions, to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.

Azure CLI Command to enable MFA for a user:
```
# Enable MFA for a user
az ad user update --id <user-object-id> --add "strongAuthenticationMethods" '[{"type": "microsoftAuthenticator"}]'
```

3. Example: In some cases, a user may delete security information related to Azure AD application registrations. This can impact the security of applications relying on those registrations, potentially leading to unauthorized access or service disruptions.

Remediation:
- Restore the deleted application registration from a backup or recreate it with the same settings and permissions.
- Update the affected applications to use the restored or recreated application registration.
- Monitor the applications for any abnormal behavior or unauthorized access.
- Regularly review and audit the application registrations to ensure they are up to date and aligned with the organization's security policies.

Azure CLI Command to restore a deleted application registration:
```
# Get the deleted application registration object ID
deleted_app_id=$(az ad app list --filter "isSoftDeleted eq true" --query "[].objectId" -o tsv)

# Restore the deleted application registration
az ad app restore --id $deleted_app_id
```
