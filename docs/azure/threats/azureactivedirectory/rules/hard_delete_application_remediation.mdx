### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Hard Delete application event in Azure Active Directory refers to the permanent removal of an application from the directory.
- When this event occurs, all associated resources and data related to the application are permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.
- This event is typically triggered when an administrator or user explicitly chooses to delete an application, either through the Azure portal or using the Azure AD PowerShell module.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with Hard Delete application in Azure Active Directory, it means that when an application is deleted, all associated data and resources are permanently removed without any possibility of recovery. This can lead to data loss and potential security breaches if sensitive information is not properly handled.

- Remediation steps using Azure console:
  1. Sign in to the Azure portal and navigate to the Azure Active Directory service.
  2. In the left-hand menu, click on "App registrations" to view the list of registered applications.
  3. Locate the application that needs to be remediated and click on it to open its details.
  4. In the application's overview page, click on "Delete" to initiate the deletion process.
  5. A confirmation dialog will appear, providing information about the hard delete process. Read the information carefully.
  6. To proceed with the hard delete, check the box next to "I understand that this operation is irreversible and I will lose all data associated with this application" and click on "Delete".
  7. The application and all associated data will be permanently deleted from Azure Active Directory.

Note: It is important to ensure that the application being deleted is no longer needed and that all necessary data has been backed up or migrated to another application or storage location before performing the hard delete.

#### Using CLI

Example of security impact with Hard Delete application in Azure Active Directory:
- If Hard Delete is enabled for Azure Active Directory, it means that when an application is deleted, all associated data and configurations are permanently removed without any possibility of recovery. This can lead to accidental or malicious deletion of critical applications, resulting in data loss and potential security breaches.

Remediation for Azure Active Directory using Azure CLI:
1. Disable Hard Delete for Azure Active Directory:
   - Open Azure CLI and authenticate with your Azure account.
   - Run the following command to disable Hard Delete for Azure Active Directory:
     ```
     az ad feature update --id 4a9480c0-db8d-4a6d-9f8d-291811a6c3bf --disable
     ```

2. Verify the status of Hard Delete for Azure Active Directory:
   - Run the following command to check the status of Hard Delete for Azure Active Directory:
     ```
     az ad feature show --id 4a9480c0-db8d-4a6d-9f8d-291811a6c3bf
     ```
   - Ensure that the "state" field shows "Disabled" to confirm that Hard Delete is successfully disabled.

3. Enable Soft Delete for Azure Active Directory (optional):
   - To provide an additional layer of protection, you can enable Soft Delete for Azure Active Directory. Soft Delete allows recovery of deleted applications within a specified retention period.
   - Run the following command to enable Soft Delete for Azure Active Directory:
     ```
     az ad feature update --id 4a9480c0-db8d-4a6d-9f8d-291811a6c3bf --enable
     ```

Note: The feature ID "4a9480c0-db8d-4a6d-9f8d-291811a6c3bf" corresponds to the Hard Delete feature in Azure Active Directory.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with Hard Delete application in Azure Active Directory:
   - If the Hard Delete application feature is enabled in Azure Active Directory, it means that when an application is deleted, it is permanently removed without any possibility of recovery. This can have security implications if a malicious actor gains unauthorized access to an application and deletes it, as there will be no way to restore the application or its associated data.

2. Remediation for Azure Active Directory using Python:
   - To remediate the security impact of Hard Delete application in Azure Active Directory using Python, you can implement a backup and restore mechanism for applications. This can be achieved by leveraging the Azure AD Graph API or Microsoft Graph API to programmatically backup the application metadata and configurations before deletion, and then restore them if needed.

   - Here's an example of a Python script that uses the Microsoft Graph API to backup and restore an application in Azure Active Directory:

     ```python
     import requests
     import json

     # Backup an application
     def backup_application(application_id, access_token):
         backup_url = f"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/{application_id}/backup"
         headers = {
             "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
             "Content-Type": "application/json"
         }
         response = requests.post(backup_url, headers=headers)
         if response.status_code == 202:
             print("Application backup initiated successfully.")
         else:
             print("Failed to initiate application backup.")

     # Restore an application
     def restore_application(application_id, access_token):
         restore_url = f"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/{application_id}/restore"
         headers = {
             "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
             "Content-Type": "application/json"
         }
         response = requests.post(restore_url, headers=headers)
         if response.status_code == 202:
             print("Application restore initiated successfully.")
         else:
             print("Failed to initiate application restore.")

     # Usage example
     application_id = "<application_id>"
     access_token = "<access_token>"

     # Backup the application
     backup_application(application_id, access_token)

     # Restore the application
     restore_application(application_id, access_token)
     ```

   - In this example, you need to replace `<application_id>` with the ID of the application you want to backup or restore, and `<access_token>` with a valid access token that has the necessary permissions to perform the backup and restore operations.
