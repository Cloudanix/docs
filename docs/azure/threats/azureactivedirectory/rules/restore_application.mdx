### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Restore application" event in Azure Active Directory refers to the process of recovering a deleted application in Azure AD.
- When an application is deleted in Azure AD, it is moved to the "Deleted applications" section where it can be restored within a certain retention period.
- The "Restore application" event allows administrators to bring back the deleted application along with its associated settings, permissions, and configurations.

#### Example

- One possible example of how security can be impacted with a Restore application event in Azure Active Directory is if the restored application has outdated or insecure configurations. For example, if the restored application has weak authentication methods or excessive permissions, it can potentially lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.

Remediation:
1. Before restoring the application, ensure that you have a backup of the application's configuration and settings.
2. After restoring the application, review and update its configurations to align with security best practices. This may include:
   - Enforcing strong authentication methods such as multi-factor authentication (MFA).
   - Regularly reviewing and updating application permissions to ensure they are least privileged.
   - Implementing secure communication protocols such as HTTPS.
   - Regularly monitoring and auditing the application's activity logs for any suspicious behavior.

Azure CLI command to restore an application from a backup:
```bash
az ad app restore --id <application_id> --backup-id <backup_id>
```

Note: The above command assumes you have the application ID and the backup ID.
