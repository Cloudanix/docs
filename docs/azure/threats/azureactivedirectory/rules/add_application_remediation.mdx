### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Add application" event in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) refers to the action of creating a new application registration within Azure AD.
- This event signifies the addition of a new application that can be used to authenticate and authorize users and services in Azure AD.
- When this event occurs, it is important to review the details of the application registration, including its permissions, authentication settings, and any associated roles or access controls.

#### Example

Example of how security can be impacted with the "Add application" event in Azure Active Directory:

1. Unauthorized application registration: If an attacker gains access to the Azure portal or has compromised a user account with sufficient privileges, they can register a malicious application in Azure Active Directory. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources within the Azure environment.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and monitor the Azure Active Directory for any unauthorized application registrations.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts with administrative privileges.
- Use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to limit the duration and scope of administrative privileges.

2. Misconfigured application permissions: During the process of adding an application, the administrator assigns permissions to the application. If these permissions are misconfigured or overly permissive, it can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources.

Remediation:
- Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions to applications.
- Regularly review and audit the permissions assigned to applications in Azure Active Directory.
- Utilize Azure AD Conditional Access policies to enforce additional security controls based on user, device, and location.

3. Lack of monitoring and logging: Without proper monitoring and logging, it can be difficult to detect any suspicious activity related to the "Add application" event. This can result in delayed or missed detection of unauthorized application registrations.

Remediation:
- Enable Azure AD audit logging to capture events related to application registrations.
- Integrate Azure AD logs with a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution for real-time monitoring and alerting.
- Regularly review and analyze the logs to identify any abnormal or suspicious activity related to application registrations.

Note: The provided remediation steps are high-level recommendations. The actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements and configurations of the Azure environment.
