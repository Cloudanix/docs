### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Add policy to application" event in Azure Active Directory refers to the action of adding a policy to an application in Azure AD.
- Policies in Azure AD are used to enforce specific security and access control requirements for applications. They can define rules such as multi-factor authentication, conditional access, or password complexity requirements.
- By adding a policy to an application, you can customize the security and access control settings for that specific application, ensuring that it aligns with your organization's security policies and compliance requirements.

#### Example

Example of how security can be impacted with "Add policy to application" event in Azure Active Directory:

1. Unauthorized access: If an attacker gains access to the Azure Active Directory and adds a policy to an application, they can potentially grant themselves or other malicious users unauthorized access to sensitive resources. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized data modifications, or even complete system compromise.

2. Privilege escalation: By adding a policy to an application, an attacker can elevate their privileges within the Azure environment. They may gain access to resources or perform actions that they were not originally authorized to do. This can result in unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or disruption of services.

3. Data exfiltration: If an attacker adds a policy to an application, they can potentially configure it to collect and exfiltrate sensitive data from the Azure environment. This can lead to the exposure of confidential information, such as customer data, intellectual property, or financial records.

Remediation:

1. Regularly review and monitor Azure Active Directory for any unauthorized changes or policies added to applications. This can be done using Azure Monitor or Azure Security Center.

2. Implement strong access controls and least privilege principles. Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to modify application policies in Azure Active Directory.

3. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts in Azure Active Directory. This adds an extra layer of security and makes it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access.

4. Regularly review and update security configurations and policies in Azure Active Directory. This includes reviewing and removing any unnecessary or outdated policies.

5. Implement Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to manage and control privileged access to Azure resources. PIM allows for just-in-time access and provides additional oversight and control over administrative actions.

Example CLI command to list application policies in Azure Active Directory:

```
az ad app permission list --id <application_id> --query '[].{AppId: appId, DisplayName: displayName, Roles: appRoles[].{Id: id, Name: value}}'
```

This command lists the application permissions and associated roles for a specific application in Azure Active Directory. By regularly reviewing this information, you can detect any unauthorized policies added to applications.
