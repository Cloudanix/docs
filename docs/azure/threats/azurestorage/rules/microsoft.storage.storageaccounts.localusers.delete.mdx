### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The Microsoft.Storage.storageAccounts.localUsers.delete event in AzureRealTime for AzureStorage indicates that a local user account has been deleted from a storage account in Azure.

2. This event signifies that a user with administrative privileges has removed a local user account that was previously created for accessing the storage account.

3. It is important to monitor this event as it can help track any changes made to the access control of the storage account and ensure that only authorized users have access to the data stored within it.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with Microsoft.Storage.storageAccounts.localUsers.delete event in Azure Storage:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the Azure Storage account and deletes a local user, it can lead to a potential security breach. This can result in unauthorized access to the storage account and its data.

2. Remediation for the security impact:
   - Regularly review and update access control policies for Azure Storage accounts to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions.
   - Enable Azure AD authentication for the storage account to enforce centralized user management and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
   - Implement Azure Monitor alerts to notify administrators when any changes are made to the local users of the storage account. This can help in detecting and responding to unauthorized deletion of local users.

3. Azure CLI command for enabling Azure AD authentication for a storage account:
   ```
   az storage account update --name <storage_account_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --enable-azure-active-directory
   ```

Note: The above command assumes that you have already authenticated with Azure CLI and have the necessary permissions to modify the storage account.
