    storage_client = StorageManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

    network_rule_set = NetworkRuleSet(
        default_action='Deny',
        bypass='AzureServices',
        virtual_network_rules=[
            VirtualNetworkRule(
                id=subnet_id,
                action='Allow'
