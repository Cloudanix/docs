   - Use Azure CLI command to update the access control settings:
     ```
     az storage account update --name <storage_account_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --default-action Deny
     ```

2. Data integrity issues:
   - Implement proper validation and authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized data manipulation or injection.
   - Regularly monitor and audit the storage tables for any suspicious or unauthorized activities.
   - Use Azure CLI command to enable auditing for the storage account:
     ```
     az storage account update --name <storage_account_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --enable-https-access true
     ```

3. Compliance violations:
   - Review the applicable compliance standards and ensure that the storage account configuration aligns with the requirements.
   - Implement additional security controls or encryption mechanisms if necessary to meet the compliance standards.
   - Use Azure CLI command to enable encryption for the storage account:
     ```
     az storage account update --name <storage_account_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --encryption-services blob
     ```

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized access, data integrity issues, and compliance violations related to Microsoft.Storage.storageAccounts.tableServices.tables.write in Azure for Azure Storage, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement strong access controls: Ensure that proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to restrict access to the storage tables. This can be achieved by using Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks.

```python
# Python script to configure RBAC for Azure Storage
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.authorization import AuthorizationManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.storage import StorageManagementClient

# Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create authorization and storage management clients
authorization_client = AuthorizationManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
storage_client = StorageManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Define the role assignment
role_assignment = {
    "properties": {
        "roleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/{roleDefinitionId}",
        "principalId": "{principalId}",
        "scope": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}"
    }
}

# Create the role assignment
authorization_client.role_assignments.create(scope, role_assignment)
```

2. Enable auditing and monitoring: Enable Azure Storage logging and monitoring features to track and detect any unauthorized write access or data integrity issues. This can be done by configuring diagnostic settings and integrating with Azure Monitor or Azure Security Center.

```python
# Python script to enable diagnostic settings for Azure Storage
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.storage import StorageManagementClient

# Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create monitor and storage management clients
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
storage_client = StorageManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Define the diagnostic settings
diagnostic_settings = {
    "name": "{diagnosticSettingsName}",
    "storage_account_id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}",
    "logs": [
        {
            "category": "StorageRead",
            "enabled": True
        },
        {
            "category": "StorageWrite",
            "enabled": True
        }
    ]
}

# Create the diagnostic settings
monitor_client.diagnostic_settings.create_or_update(resource_uri, diagnostic_settings_name, diagnostic_settings)
```

3. Regularly review and update security configurations: Continuously assess and update the security configurations of your Azure Storage accounts. This includes reviewing access controls, encryption settings, and network configurations to ensure they align with best practices and compliance requirements.

```python
# Python script to update Azure Storage account properties
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.storage import StorageManagementClient

# Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create storage management client
storage_client = StorageManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Get the storage account
storage_account = storage_client.storage_accounts.get_properties(resource_group_name, storage_account_name)

# Update the storage account properties
storage_account.properties.encryption.services.table.enabled = True
storage_account.properties.network_acls.default_action = "Deny"

# Update the storage account
storage_client.storage_accounts.update(resource_group_name, storage_account_name, storage_account)
```

These steps will help mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access, data integrity issues, and compliance violations in Azure Storage using Python scripts.
