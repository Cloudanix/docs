#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized access, data leakage, and compliance violations related to Microsoft.Storage.storageAccounts.tableServices.write in Azure for Azure Storage, you can take the following steps:

1. Implement strong access controls: Ensure that appropriate access controls are in place for the storage account's table services. This includes using role-based access control (RBAC) to grant permissions only to authorized users or applications. Regularly review and update access permissions to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

```python
# Example Python script to set RBAC permissions for a storage account's table services
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.authorization import AuthorizationManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.authorization.models import RoleAssignmentCreateParameters

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create an instance of the AuthorizationManagementClient
authorization_client = AuthorizationManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Define the role assignment parameters
role_assignment_params = RoleAssignmentCreateParameters(
    role_definition_id='/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/{role_definition_id}',
    principal_id='/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/providers/Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory/users/{user_id}',
    scope='/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storage_account}'
)

# Create the role assignment
authorization_client.role_assignments.create(scope, role_assignment_params)
```

2. Enable auditing and monitoring: Enable auditing and monitoring features provided by Azure Storage to detect and track any unauthorized access or data modifications. This includes enabling Azure Storage Analytics and configuring logging and metrics to capture relevant events. Regularly review and analyze the logs to identify any suspicious activities.

```python
# Example Python script to enable logging and metrics for Azure Storage
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.storage import StorageManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.storage.models import StorageServiceProperties

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create an instance of the StorageManagementClient
storage_client = StorageManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Get the storage account properties
storage_account_properties = storage_client.storage_accounts.get_properties(
    resource_group_name, storage_account_name
)

# Enable logging and metrics
storage_account_properties.logging = StorageServiceProperties.Logging(
    read=True,
    write=True,
    delete=True,
    retention_policy=StorageServiceProperties.RetentionPolicy(enabled=True, days=30)
)
storage_account_properties.hour_metrics = StorageServiceProperties.HourMetrics(
    enabled=True,
    retention_policy=StorageServiceProperties.RetentionPolicy(enabled=True, days=30),
    version='1.0'
)
storage_account_properties.minute_metrics = StorageServiceProperties.MinuteMetrics(
    enabled=True,
    retention_policy=StorageServiceProperties.RetentionPolicy(enabled=True, days=30),
    version='1.0'
)

# Update the storage account properties
storage_client.storage_accounts.update(
    resource_group_name, storage_account_name, storage_account_properties
)
```

3. Regularly backup and restore data: Implement a backup and restore strategy for the storage account's table services to mitigate the risk of data loss or unauthorized modifications. This includes regularly backing up the data and verifying the integrity of the backups. In case of any security incidents, you can restore the data from a known good backup.

```python
# Example Python script to backup and restore Azure Storage table data
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.data.tables import TableServiceClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create an instance of the TableServiceClient
table_service_client = TableServiceClient.from_connection_string(
    connection_string, credential=credential
)

# Backup table data
table_service_client.create_table_backup(table_name, backup_name)

# Restore table data
table_service_client.restore_table_backup(table_name, backup_name)
```

These steps will help mitigate the security impacts and ensure the integrity and compliance of your Azure Storage account's table services.
