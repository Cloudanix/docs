### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Microsoft.Storage.storageAccounts.objectReplicationPolicies.delete" event in AzureRealTime for AzureStorage indicates that an object replication policy has been deleted for a storage account.
- This event signifies a change in the replication configuration of the storage account, specifically the removal of a replication policy.
- It is important to monitor this event as it can impact the data redundancy and availability of the storage account, especially if there were multiple replication policies in place.

#### Example

1. Impact on Security: The Microsoft.Storage.storageAccounts.objectReplicationPolicies.delete event in AzureRealTime for Azure Storage can potentially impact security if it is triggered unintentionally or by an unauthorized user. This event indicates that an object replication policy has been deleted, which could result in the loss of data redundancy and increase the risk of data loss or unauthorized access.

2. Example Scenario: Let's consider a situation where an attacker gains unauthorized access to the Azure Storage account and deletes the object replication policies. This action would remove the redundancy and failover capabilities provided by replication, making the data more vulnerable to loss or compromise.

3. Remediation Steps:
- Immediately revoke any unauthorized access to the Azure Storage account by disabling or removing the compromised credentials or identities.
- Restore the deleted object replication policies to ensure data redundancy and failover capabilities are reinstated.
- Monitor the Azure Storage account for any suspicious activities and enable auditing and logging features to track any unauthorized access attempts.

Azure CLI Command for restoring object replication policies:
```
az storage account show --name <storage_account_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --query id --output tsv | az monitor activity-log alert create --name "Restore Object Replication Policies" --description "Restore object replication policies after deletion event" --condition category=AdministrativeAndServiceManagement resourceType=Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts operations=Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/delete --action-type Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/restoreObjectReplicationPolicies --enabled true
```

Note: The above command creates an activity log alert that triggers the restoration of object replication policies whenever a delete event is detected for the Azure Storage account.
