### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The "Microsoft.Storage.storageAccounts.fileServices.fileshares.files.delete" event in AzureRealTime for AzureStorage indicates that a file has been deleted from a file share within a storage account in Azure.

2. This event is triggered when a user or an application deletes a file from a file share using Azure Storage APIs or tools.

3. The event provides real-time visibility into file-level deletions, allowing administrators to track and monitor file deletions for auditing, compliance, and troubleshooting purposes.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.Storage.storageAccounts.fileServices.fileshares.files.delete event is triggered in Azure Storage, it could indicate that a file has been deleted from a file share within a storage account. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or loss of critical data if the file was not intended to be deleted.

2. Remediation steps:
   - Identify the cause: Investigate the event logs and audit trails to determine the source of the deletion event. This could be due to human error, malicious activity, or misconfigured access controls.
   - Restore the deleted file: If the deletion was unintended, restore the deleted file from a backup or snapshot of the file share. Azure provides options to restore files from snapshots or backups, depending on the configuration of your storage account.
   - Strengthen security controls: Review and update the access controls and permissions for the file share to prevent unauthorized deletion in the future. Ensure that only authorized users or applications have the necessary permissions to delete files.

Example CLI commands for Azure Storage:
```bash
# Restore a deleted file from a snapshot
az storage file restore --account-name <storage_account_name> --share-name <file_share_name> --path <file_path> --snapshot <snapshot_id>

# Restore a deleted file from a backup
az storage file restore --account-name <storage_account_name> --share-name <file_share_name> --path <file_path> --backup <backup_id>
```

Note: Replace `<storage_account_name>`, `<file_share_name>`, `<file_path>`, `<snapshot_id>`, and `<backup_id>` with the actual values specific to your environment.
