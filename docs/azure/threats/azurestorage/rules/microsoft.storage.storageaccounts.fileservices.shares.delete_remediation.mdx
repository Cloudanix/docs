### Event Information

1. The Microsoft.Storage.storageAccounts.fileServices.shares.delete event in Azure for Azure Storage indicates that a file share has been deleted within a storage account.
2. This event signifies that the data stored within the deleted file share will no longer be accessible.
3. It is important to monitor this event as it can help track any accidental or unauthorized deletions of file shares, and take appropriate actions to restore or recover the data if necessary.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of file shares: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Storage.storageAccounts.fileServices.shares.delete in Azure for Azure Storage, one example could be an unauthorized user gaining access to the necessary permissions and deleting critical file shares. This could result in the loss of important data and disrupt business operations.

2. Data breach through deletion: Another example could be a malicious actor exploiting a vulnerability in the Azure Storage service and using the delete operation to remove sensitive files or folders. This could lead to a data breach, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the stored data.

3. Impact on compliance requirements: The deletion of file shares without proper authorization and audit trails can also impact compliance requirements. For example, if the organization is subject to regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA, the unauthorized deletion of files could result in non-compliance and potential legal consequences. It is crucial to have proper access controls, monitoring, and logging mechanisms in place to mitigate such security risks.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion of file shares in Azure Storage using the Azure console, follow these steps:

1. Review and update access controls:
   - Identify the affected file shares and their associated storage accounts.
   - Navigate to the Azure portal and open the Azure Storage account.
   - Go to the "File shares" section and select the specific file share that was deleted.
   - Click on the "Access control (IAM)" tab and review the existing access permissions.
   - Remove any unnecessary or unauthorized access roles or permissions.
   - Ensure that only trusted individuals or groups have the necessary permissions to delete file shares.

2. Enable auditing and monitoring:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Storage account.
   - Go to the "Monitoring" section and enable auditing for file share activities.
   - Configure the auditing settings to capture delete actions on file shares.
   - Set up alerts or notifications to be triggered when unauthorized deletion attempts occur.
   - Regularly review the audit logs and investigate any suspicious activities.

3. Implement backup and recovery measures:
   - Set up regular backups of critical file shares using Azure Backup or other suitable backup solutions.
   - Ensure that backups are stored in a separate location or storage account to prevent accidental deletion.
   - Test the backup and recovery process to ensure that files can be restored in case of accidental or unauthorized deletion.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of file shares in Azure Storage and ensure the availability and integrity of your data.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unauthorized deletion of file shares in Azure Storage using Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Ensure that proper access controls are in place to limit the permissions of users and prevent unauthorized deletion of file shares. Grant only the necessary permissions to users or groups who require access to the file shares.

2. Enable auditing and monitoring: Enable auditing for Azure Storage accounts to track and monitor any deletion activities. This will help in identifying any unauthorized deletion attempts and take appropriate actions. You can use the following Azure CLI command to enable auditing for a storage account:

   ```
   az storage account update --name <storage_account_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --enable-https-access --enable-audit-logs
   ```

3. Regularly backup file shares: Implement a backup strategy to regularly backup the file shares. This will ensure that even if a file share is accidentally or maliciously deleted, you can restore the data from the backups. You can use Azure CLI commands to automate the backup process, such as using Azure Blob Storage and Azure File Sync.

Remember to customize the commands by replacing `<storage_account_name>` with the actual name of the storage account and `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group where the storage account is located.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of file shares in Azure Storage using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to perform the delete action on file shares. This can be achieved by using Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to the storage account.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareClient

# Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create a ShareClient instance
share_client = ShareClient(account_url="https://<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net",
                           share_name="<share-name>",
                           credential=credential)

# Set the appropriate access control for the file share
share_client.set_share_acl(signed_identifiers={
    "user-read": {
        "access_policy": {
            "start": "<start-date>",
            "expiry": "<expiry-date>",
            "permission": "r"
        }
    },
    "user-write": {
        "access_policy": {
            "start": "<start-date>",
            "expiry": "<expiry-date>",
            "permission": "rw"
        }
    }
})
```

2. Enable monitoring and logging: Configure Azure Monitor and Azure Storage Analytics to track and log activities related to file shares. This will help in detecting any unauthorized deletion attempts and provide visibility into the actions performed on the file shares.

```python
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.storage import StorageManagementClient

# Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create a MonitorManagementClient instance
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, "<subscription-id>")

# Enable diagnostic settings for the storage account
monitor_client.diagnostic_settings.create_or_update(
    "<resource-group-name>",
    "<storage-account-name>",
    "<diagnostic-settings-name>",
    {
        "logs": [
            {
                "category": "Delete",
                "enabled": True
            }
        ]
    }
)

# Create a StorageManagementClient instance
storage_client = StorageManagementClient(credential, "<subscription-id>")

# Enable storage analytics for the storage account
storage_client.storage_accounts.update(
    "<resource-group-name>",
    "<storage-account-name>",
    {
        "analytics": {
            "log": {
                "version": "1.0",
                "read": True,
                "write": True,
                "delete": True,
                "retentionPolicy": {
                    "enabled": True,
                    "days": 30
                }
            }
        }
    }
)
```

3. Implement backup and recovery mechanisms: Regularly backup the critical data stored in file shares to ensure that it can be restored in case of accidental or unauthorized deletion. Azure provides various backup and recovery options, such as Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery, which can be integrated with your Python scripts to automate the backup process.

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareServiceClient

# Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create a ShareServiceClient instance
service_client = ShareServiceClient(account_url="https://<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net",
                                   credential=credential)

# Create a snapshot of the file share
snapshot = service_client.create_snapshot("<share-name>")

# Backup the snapshot to a different storage account or location
backup_client = ShareServiceClient(account_url="https://<backup-storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net",
                                   credential=credential)

backup_client.create_share_from_snapshot("<backup-share-name>", snapshot)
```

By implementing these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of file shares in Azure Storage and ensure the availability, integrity, and security of your data.
