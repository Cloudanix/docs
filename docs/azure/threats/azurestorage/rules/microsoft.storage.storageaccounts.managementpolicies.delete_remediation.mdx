### Event Information

1. The Microsoft.Storage.storageAccounts.managementPolicies.delete event in Azure for Azure Storage indicates that a management policy for a storage account has been deleted.
2. This event signifies that any previously defined management policies, such as retention policies or tiering policies, will no longer be applied to the storage account.
3. It is important to monitor this event to ensure that the deletion of a management policy does not impact data retention or other compliance requirements for the Azure Storage account.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of management policies: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Storage.storageAccounts.managementPolicies.delete in Azure for Azure Storage, it could potentially lead to unauthorized deletion of management policies. This means that an attacker could delete or modify the policies that govern the management of the storage account, potentially leading to data loss or unauthorized access to the stored data.

2. Exposure of sensitive information: The deletion of management policies could also result in the exposure of sensitive information. For example, if a management policy is configured to automatically encrypt all data stored in the Azure Storage account, deleting this policy could result in the storage account being left unencrypted, exposing the data to potential security breaches.

3. Compliance violations: Deleting management policies without proper authorization or documentation can also lead to compliance violations. Many organizations have specific policies and regulations in place that require the retention of certain types of data for a specific period of time. If a management policy responsible for enforcing these retention requirements is deleted, it could result in non-compliance with industry regulations or internal policies.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Identify the affected storage account: First, you need to identify the Azure Storage account that has been impacted by the unauthorized deletion of management policies. This can be done by reviewing the logs or monitoring alerts in the Azure portal.

2. Restore the deleted management policies: Once you have identified the affected storage account, you can restore the deleted management policies. To do this, navigate to the Azure portal and open the storage account. Go to the "Configuration" section and select "Management Policies". From there, you should be able to see a list of previously configured policies. Select the policy that was deleted and click on the "Restore" button to bring it back.

3. Review and enhance security measures: After restoring the deleted management policies, it is important to review and enhance the security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. This may include enabling auditing and monitoring features, implementing access controls and permissions, and regularly reviewing and updating security policies and procedures. Additionally, it is recommended to educate and train users on the importance of security and the potential risks associated with unauthorized actions.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the unauthorized deletion of management policies for Azure Storage in Azure, you can take the following steps using Azure CLI commands:

1. Monitor and detect unauthorized deletion:
   - Enable Azure Monitor for Azure Storage to track and monitor management policy events.
   - Set up alerts or notifications to receive notifications when management policies are deleted.

2. Implement access controls and permissions:
   - Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete management policies.
   - Use Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to assign appropriate roles and permissions to users and groups.
   - Regularly review and update access controls to prevent unauthorized access.

3. Enable Azure Storage soft delete:
   - Enable soft delete for Azure Storage accounts to provide an additional layer of protection against accidental or unauthorized deletion.
   - Soft delete allows you to recover deleted management policies within a specified retention period.

CLI commands:
- To enable Azure Monitor for Azure Storage:
  ```
  az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name <diagnostic-settings-name> --resource <storage-account-id> --resource-type Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts --logs '[{"category": "StorageRead", "enabled": true}, {"category": "StorageWrite", "enabled": true}]'
  ```

- To set up alerts for management policy deletion:
  ```
  az monitor metrics alert create --name <alert-name> --resource <storage-account-id> --resource-type Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts --condition "category eq 'StorageWrite' and operationNameValue eq 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/managementPolicies/delete' and status eq 'Failed'" --action <action-group-id>
  ```

- To enable soft delete for Azure Storage:
  ```
  az storage account update --name <storage-account-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --enable-soft-delete true
  ```

Note: Replace `<diagnostic-settings-name>`, `<storage-account-id>`, `<alert-name>`, `<action-group-id>`, `<storage-account-name>`, and `<resource-group-name>` with the appropriate values specific to your environment.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of management policies for Azure Storage using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. Monitor and detect unauthorized deletion: Implement Azure Monitor to track and log any changes made to the management policies of your Azure Storage accounts. You can use the Azure Monitor REST API or the Azure SDK for Python to retrieve the management policy settings and compare them with the expected configuration. If any unauthorized changes are detected, you can take appropriate actions, such as sending notifications or triggering automated remediation scripts.

```python
# Example code to retrieve management policy settings for an Azure Storage account using Python SDK

from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create a BlobServiceClient instance
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(account_url="https://<your-storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net", credential=credential)

# Get the management policy settings
management_policy = blob_service_client.get_service_properties().management_policy
```

2. Implement access controls and RBAC: Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to modify the management policies of your Azure Storage accounts. Use Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to assign appropriate roles and permissions to users and groups. Regularly review and update these access controls to minimize the risk of unauthorized changes.

```python
# Example code to assign a role to a user for an Azure Storage account using Python SDK

from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.authorization import AuthorizationManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create an AuthorizationManagementClient instance
authorization_client = AuthorizationManagementClient(credential, "<your-subscription-id>")

# Assign a role to a user for the storage account
authorization_client.role_assignments.create(
    scope="/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<your-resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<your-storage-account>",
    role_definition_id="/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/<your-role-definition-id>",
    principal_id="<user-object-id>"
)
```

3. Enable soft delete and backups: Enable soft delete for your Azure Storage accounts to provide an additional layer of protection against accidental deletion. Soft delete allows you to recover deleted management policies within a specified retention period. Additionally, regularly back up your critical data stored in Azure Storage using services like Azure Backup or Azure Blob Storage snapshots. This ensures that even if the management policies are deleted, you can restore the data from the backups.

```python
# Example code to enable soft delete for an Azure Storage account using Python SDK

from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create a BlobServiceClient instance
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(account_url="https://<your-storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net", credential=credential)

# Enable soft delete for the storage account
blob_service_client.set_service_properties(delete_retention_policy=7)  # Set the retention period in days
```
