### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.registries.tokens.delete event in Azure Realtime for Azure Container Service indicates that a token associated with a container registry has been deleted.
2. This event is triggered when a user or an automated process deletes a token that was previously created for accessing a container registry.
3. The event provides visibility into the management of access tokens for container registries, allowing administrators to track and audit token deletions for security and compliance purposes.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.registries.tokens.delete event in Azure Real-time for Azure Container Service, they can potentially delete the authentication tokens for the container registry. This can lead to unauthorized access to the container registry and compromise the security of the containers and the data stored within them.

Remediation:
- Regularly monitor and review the Azure Activity Logs and Azure Monitor for any suspicious activities related to the Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.registries.tokens.delete event.
- Implement strong access controls and permissions for the Azure Container Registry, ensuring that only authorized users have the necessary privileges to delete tokens.
- Enable Azure AD authentication for the Azure Container Registry, which provides additional security by leveraging Azure Active Directory for user authentication and authorization.
- Implement Azure Policy to enforce compliance and prevent unauthorized deletion of tokens. For example, you can create a policy that denies the deletion of tokens for specific user roles or restricts the deletion to specific IP ranges.

Example CLI command to enable Azure AD authentication for Azure Container Registry:
```
az acr update --name <acr_name> --admin-enabled false
az acr update --name <acr_name> --aad-enabled true
```

Example Azure Policy to deny deletion of tokens for specific user roles:
```json
{
  "if": {
    "allOf": [
      {
        "field": "type",
        "equals": "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/tokens"
      },
      {
        "field": "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/tokens/delete",
        "equals": "true"
      },
      {
        "field": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/principalType",
        "equals": "User"
      },
      {
        "field": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/roleDefinitionId",
        "in": [
          "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/<role_definition_id>"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "then": {
    "effect": "deny"
  }
}
```
