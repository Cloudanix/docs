### Event Information

- The Microsoft.ContainerService.managedClusters.pods.delete event in Azure for Azure Container Service indicates that a pod has been deleted within a managed cluster.
- This event signifies that a specific pod, which is the smallest deployable unit in a Kubernetes cluster, has been removed from the managed cluster.
- The event can be used to track and monitor pod deletion activities, allowing administrators to troubleshoot issues, audit changes, and ensure the desired state of the cluster.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of pods: If security is impacted with Microsoft.ContainerService.managedClusters.pods.delete in Azure for Azure Container Service, it could potentially allow unauthorized users or malicious actors to delete pods within the managed cluster. This could lead to disruption of services or unauthorized access to sensitive data within the pods.

2. Data loss or leakage: If security is impacted, the deletion of pods could result in data loss or leakage. Pods often contain important application data or configurations, and their deletion without proper authorization or backup mechanisms in place could result in permanent loss of data or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

3. Service disruption: Deleting pods within a managed cluster can cause service disruption, especially if the pods are critical components of an application or service. This can lead to downtime, loss of availability, and potential financial or reputational impact for the organization. It is important to ensure that proper access controls and monitoring mechanisms are in place to prevent unauthorized deletion of pods.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To mitigate the security risks associated with unauthorized deletion of pods in Azure Container Service using the Azure console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):
   - Navigate to the Azure portal and open the Azure Container Service resource.
   - Go to the "Access control (IAM)" tab.
   - Click on the "+ Add" button to add a new role assignment.
   - Select the appropriate role (e.g., "Contributor" or a custom role) for the user or group that needs access to delete pods.
   - Specify the scope of the role assignment (e.g., the specific container service or resource group).
   - Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

2. Enable Audit Logging:
   - In the Azure portal, go to the Azure Container Service resource.
   - Navigate to the "Monitoring" section.
   - Enable the audit logging feature, which will capture all actions performed on the pods, including deletions.
   - Configure the destination for the audit logs, such as Azure Storage or Azure Event Hubs.
   - Save the settings to start capturing the audit logs.

3. Regularly Monitor and Analyze Audit Logs:
   - Use Azure Monitor or a third-party monitoring solution to regularly review the audit logs for any unauthorized or suspicious pod deletions.
   - Set up alerts or notifications to receive real-time notifications for any unusual activities.
   - Investigate and take appropriate actions if any unauthorized deletions are detected, such as revoking access or escalating the incident to the security team.

By following these steps, you can enhance the security of your Azure Container Service and mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized pod deletions.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the security risks associated with unauthorized deletion of pods in Azure Container Service using Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement RBAC: Use Azure CLI to assign appropriate roles and permissions to users or groups who need access to delete pods. This will ensure that only authorized individuals can perform this action. 

```bash
az role assignment create --assignee <user or group principal ID> --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User" --scope <resource group or cluster ID>
```

2. Enable auditing and monitoring: Set up auditing and monitoring for pod deletions to detect any unauthorized or suspicious activities. This can be done using Azure Monitor or Azure Log Analytics.

```bash
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name <diagnostic settings name> --resource <resource ID> --logs '[{"category": "kube-audit", "enabled": true}]'
```

3. Regularly review and analyze logs: Continuously monitor and review the logs generated by auditing and monitoring tools to identify any potential security incidents or anomalies related to pod deletions.

```bash
az monitor log-analytics workspace query --workspace <workspace ID> --analytics-query "AzureDiagnostics | where Category == 'kube-audit' | where OperationName == 'Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/pods/delete' | project TimeGenerated, Caller, ResourceId, ResultSignature"
```

By implementing RBAC, enabling auditing and monitoring, and regularly reviewing logs, you can mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized deletion of pods in Azure Container Service.

#### Using Python

To mitigate the security risks associated with unauthorized deletion of pods in Azure Container Service, you can use the following Python script:

1. Implement RBAC for Access Control:
   - Use the `azure.mgmt.authorization` library to manage role assignments and permissions.
   - Create a custom role with the necessary permissions for pod deletion.
   - Assign this role to only authorized individuals or service principals.

```python
from azure.mgmt.authorization import AuthorizationManagementClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
authorization_client = AuthorizationManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Create a custom role definition with necessary permissions
role_definition = {
    "properties": {
        "roleName": "Custom Pod Deletion Role",
        "description": "Role with permissions to delete pods",
        "assignableScopes": ["/subscriptions/{subscription_id}"],
        "permissions": [
            {
                "actions": [
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/pods/delete"
                ],
                "notActions": [],
                "dataActions": [],
                "notDataActions": []
            }
        ]
    }
}

# Create the custom role definition
role_definition = authorization_client.role_definitions.create_or_update(
    scope="/subscriptions/{subscription_id}",
    role_definition_name="custom-pod-deletion-role",
    parameters=role_definition
)

# Assign the custom role to authorized individuals or service principals
assignment = authorization_client.role_assignments.create(
    scope="/subscriptions/{subscription_id}",
    role_assignment_name="pod-deletion-role-assignment",
    parameters={
        "role_definition_id": role_definition.id,
        "principal_id": "<principal_id>"
    }
)
```

2. Monitor and Audit Pod Deletions:
   - Use the `azure.mgmt.monitor` library to retrieve logs and metrics related to pod deletions.
   - Set up alerts or notifications for any suspicious or unauthorized pod deletion activities.

```python
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient

monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Retrieve logs for pod deletions
logs = monitor_client.activity_logs.list(
    filter="eventTimestamp ge datetime'2022-01-01T00:00:00Z' and "
           "eventTimestamp le datetime'2022-01-31T23:59:59Z' and "
           "operationName eq 'Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/pods/delete'"
)

for log in logs:
    print(log.event_timestamp, log.operation_name, log.resource_id, log.status)

# Set up alerts or notifications for suspicious or unauthorized pod deletions
# Use the `azure.mgmt.monitor` library to create and manage alerts
```

By implementing RBAC and monitoring pod deletions, you can effectively mitigate the security risks associated with unauthorized deletion of pods in Azure Container Service.
