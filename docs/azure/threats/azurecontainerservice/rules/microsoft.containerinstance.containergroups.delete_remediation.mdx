### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.ContainerInstance.containerGroups.delete event in Azure Realtime for Azure Container Service indicates that a container group has been deleted.
- This event signifies that all containers within the specified container group have been terminated and removed from the Azure Container Instances service.
- It is important to note that deleting a container group will also delete any associated resources such as volumes, IP addresses, and network interfaces.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Azure Container Service and deletes a container group using the `az container delete` command, it can lead to a security breach. This can result in the loss of critical data or disruption of services running within the container group.

Remediation:
- Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to manage container groups.
- Regularly review and audit access control policies to identify and revoke unnecessary privileges.
- Enable Azure Monitor to track and alert on any suspicious activities related to container group deletion.
- Implement Azure Policy to enforce compliance and prevent unauthorized deletion of container groups.

Example CLI command to delete a container group:
```
az container delete --name <container-group-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --yes
```

2. Example of security impact: If a malicious actor gains access to the Azure Resource Manager and executes a delete operation on a container group using the Azure Resource Manager API, it can result in the unauthorized deletion of the container group. This can lead to data loss, service disruption, and potential exposure of sensitive information.

Remediation:
- Implement Azure AD authentication and enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to secure access to the Azure Resource Manager.
- Regularly monitor and review Azure Activity Logs and Azure Security Center alerts for any suspicious activities related to container group deletion.
- Enable Azure Resource Locks to prevent accidental or unauthorized deletion of critical container groups.
- Implement Azure Policy to enforce compliance and prevent unauthorized deletion of container groups.

Example Azure CLI command to delete a container group:
```
az rest --method delete --uri "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups/{containerGroupName}?api-version=2021-03-01"
```

3. Example of security impact: If a misconfigured access control policy allows a user with read-only permissions to delete a container group using the Azure portal, it can result in an unauthorized deletion. This can lead to service disruption and potential data loss.

Remediation:
- Review and update access control policies to ensure that only users with the necessary permissions can delete container groups.
- Implement Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to provide just-in-time access for administrative tasks, including container group deletion.
- Regularly review and audit access control policies to identify and revoke unnecessary privileges.
- Enable Azure Monitor to track and alert on any suspicious activities related to container group deletion.

Example Azure CLI command to delete a container group:
```
az container delete --name <container-group-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --yes
```
