Python script example for monitoring and analyzing logs for unauthorized access:

```python
import azure.mgmt.monitor
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

# Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create a client for Azure Monitor
monitor_client = azure.mgmt.monitor.MonitorManagementClient(credential)

# Define the query to retrieve logs for unauthorized access
query = "AzureActivity | where OperationName == 'Microsoft.Sql/register/action' and ResultType == 'Failed'"

# Execute the query and retrieve the logs
logs = monitor_client.logs.list(query)

# Process the logs and take appropriate actions
for log in logs:
    # Perform analysis and remediation actions based on the log information
    # For example, send notifications, block IP addresses, or investigate further
    print(log)
```

Note: The above script uses the Azure SDK for Python to authenticate and interact with Azure Monitor. You may need to install the required packages (`azure-mgmt-monitor`, `azure-identity`) using pip before running the script.
