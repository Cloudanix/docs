Here's an example of a Python script that demonstrates how to implement some of these remediation steps using the Azure SDK for Python:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Specify your Azure subscription ID and resource group name
subscription_id = "<your-subscription-id>"
resource_group_name = "<your-resource-group-name>"

# Specify the Azure SQL managed instance name
managed_instance_name = "<your-managed-instance-name>"

# Create the SQL management client
sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Enable Azure Active Directory authentication for the managed instance
sql_client.managed_instances.begin_create_or_update(
    resource_group_name,
    managed_instance_name,
    {
        "identity": {
            "type": "SystemAssigned"
        }
    }
).wait()

# Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for the managed instance
sql_client.managed_instances.begin_create_or_update(
    resource_group_name,
    managed_instance_name,
    {
        "transparent_data_encryption": {
            "status": "Enabled"
        }
    }
).wait()

# Enable SSL/TLS connections for the managed instance
sql_client.managed_instances.begin_create_or_update(
    resource_group_name,
    managed_instance_name,
    {
        "ssl_enforcement": "Enabled"
    }
).wait()

# Enable automated backups for the managed instance
sql_client.managed_instances.begin_create_or_update(
    resource_group_name,
    managed_instance_name,
    {
        "backup": {
            "retention_days": 30,
            "geo_redundant_backup": "Enabled"
        }
    }
).wait()

# Implement data classification and labeling for sensitive data protection
sql_client.managed_instances.begin_create_or_update(
    resource_group_name,
    managed_instance_name,
    {
        "information_protection": {
            "sensitivity_label": {
                "label_id": "<your-sensitivity-label-id>"
            }
        }
    }
).wait()
```
