### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Sql.servers.write event in AzureRealTime for AzureDatabaseService refers to a write operation performed on a SQL server within the Azure Database Service.
- This event indicates that data has been written or modified in the SQL server, such as inserting new records, updating existing records, or deleting records.
- It is important to monitor this event as it helps track changes made to the SQL server and can be useful for auditing, troubleshooting, and ensuring data integrity.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.Sql.servers.write event is triggered in Azure Real-time Analytics for Azure Database Service, it could indicate that an unauthorized user or application has gained write access to the SQL server. This could potentially lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications to the database, or injection of malicious code.

Remediation:
- Immediately revoke the write access permissions for the unauthorized user or application.
- Change the credentials (username and password) for the SQL server to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Enable auditing and monitoring features in Azure SQL Database to track any suspicious activities and investigate the root cause of the security breach.

Azure CLI command to revoke write access for a user:
```
az sql server ad-admin delete --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <server-name> --display-name <user-display-name>
```

Azure CLI command to change SQL server credentials:
```
az sql server update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <server-name> --admin-password <new-password>
```

2. Example of security impact: The Microsoft.Sql.servers.write event in Azure Real-time Analytics for Azure Database Service could also indicate a potential SQL injection attack. This occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious code, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or data corruption.

Remediation:
- Implement input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Regularly update and patch the database server to address any known vulnerabilities.
- Monitor and analyze database logs and network traffic to detect any suspicious SQL queries or patterns.

3. Example of security impact: The Microsoft.Sql.servers.write event in Azure Real-time Analytics for Azure Database Service could indicate a misconfiguration or weak security controls, allowing unauthorized users to gain write access to the SQL server. This could result in unauthorized modifications to the database, data loss, or data leakage.

Remediation:
- Review and update the access control policies for the SQL server to ensure that only authorized users or applications have write access.
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access.
- Regularly perform security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address any vulnerabilities in the SQL server configuration.
