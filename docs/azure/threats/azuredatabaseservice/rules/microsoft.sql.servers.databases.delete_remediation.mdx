### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Sql.servers.databases.delete event in AzureRealTime for AzureDatabaseService indicates that a database has been deleted in the Azure SQL Server.
- This event signifies that a specific database within the SQL Server has been permanently removed and cannot be recovered.
- It is important to note that this event does not delete the entire SQL Server instance, but only the specified database within it.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.Sql.servers.databases.delete event is triggered in Azure Real-time for Azure Database Service, it could indicate that a database has been deleted without proper authorization or by an unauthorized user. This can lead to data loss, potential security breaches, and disruption of business operations.

Remediation:
- Enable auditing and monitoring: Implement Azure SQL Database auditing to track database deletion events and monitor for any suspicious activities. This will help in identifying unauthorized deletions and taking appropriate actions.
- Implement access controls: Ensure that proper access controls are in place to restrict database deletion permissions to authorized users only. Use Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to assign appropriate roles and permissions to users and regularly review and update these access controls.
- Enable backups and retention policies: Regularly backup your databases and implement retention policies to ensure that deleted databases can be recovered if needed. Azure provides automated backups and point-in-time restore capabilities for Azure SQL Database, which can be configured using Azure Portal or Azure CLI.

Example Azure CLI command to enable auditing for Azure SQL Database:
```
az sql db audit-policy update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <server-name> --database <database-name> --state Enabled --storage-account <storage-account-name> --storage-key <storage-account-key>
```

Example Azure CLI command to assign RBAC role for Azure SQL Database:
```
az role assignment create --assignee <user-or-group-object-id> --role "Contributor" --scope /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/<server-name>/databases/<database-name>
```

Example Azure CLI command to configure automated backups for Azure SQL Database:
```
az sql db update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <server-name> --name <database-name> --backup-storage-redundancy Local --retention 30
```


2. Example of security impact: Another possible security impact of the Microsoft.Sql.servers.databases.delete event in Azure Real-time for Azure Database Service is the accidental deletion of a database by an authorized user. This can occur due to human error or misconfiguration, leading to data loss and potential disruption of business operations.

Remediation:
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enforce the use of MFA for all users with administrative privileges to reduce the risk of accidental deletions. This adds an extra layer of security and ensures that only authorized individuals can perform critical operations like database deletion.
- Enable soft delete: Enable the soft delete feature for Azure SQL Database, which allows you to recover deleted databases within a specified retention period. Soft delete helps in mitigating the impact of accidental deletions by providing a recovery option.
- Regularly review and test backup and restore procedures: Ensure that regular backups are being taken and test the restore process to verify that backups are valid and can be used to recover deleted databases if needed.

Example Azure CLI command to enable soft delete for Azure SQL Database:
```
az sql db update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <server-name> --name <database-name> --retention 30 --soft-delete-period 14
```


3. Example of security impact: The Microsoft.Sql.servers.databases.delete event in Azure Real-time for Azure Database Service can also indicate a potential security breach where an attacker gains unauthorized access to the Azure SQL Database and deletes critical data or databases.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls: Ensure that strong access controls are in place, including strong passwords, regular password rotation, and enforcing Azure AD authentication for Azure SQL Database. This helps in preventing unauthorized access to the database and reduces the risk of security breaches.
- Enable threat detection and alerts: Enable Azure SQL Database threat detection and configure alerts to be notified of any suspicious activities, including database deletions. This allows for timely response and investigation in case of security incidents.
- Regularly review and monitor database activity: Regularly review database activity logs and monitor for any unusual or suspicious activities. Implement log analytics and use Azure Monitor to gain insights into database activities and detect any potential security threats.

Example Azure CLI command to enable Azure SQL Database threat detection:
```
az sql db threat-policy update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <server-name> --database <database-name> --state Enabled --email-address <email-address> --email-account-admins
```
