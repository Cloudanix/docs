Here's an example of a Python script that uses the Azure SDK for Python (azure-mgmt-sql) to implement RBAC for Azure SQL Database:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Specify your Azure subscription ID and resource group name
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
resource_group_name = 'your-resource-group'

# Specify the Azure SQL Database name and associated virtual network/subnet
database_name = 'your-database-name'
virtual_network_name = 'your-virtual-network-name'
subnet_name = 'your-subnet-name'

# Create the SQL management client
sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Get the Azure SQL Database resource
database = sql_client.databases.get(resource_group_name, database_name)

# Add RBAC role assignment to restrict access
sql_client.database_threat_detection_policies.create_or_update(
    resource_group_name,
    database_name,
    {
        'kind': 'Database',
        'state': 'Enabled',
        'storage_account_access_key': 'your-storage-account-access-key',
        'storage_endpoint': 'your-storage-endpoint',
        'retention_days': 30
    }
)

# Grant RBAC role assignment to a specific user or service principal
sql_client.sql_servers.sql_server_security_alert_policies.create_or_update(
    resource_group_name,
    database_name,
    {
        'kind': 'Database',
        'state': 'Enabled',
        'storage_account_access_key': 'your-storage-account-access-key',
        'storage_endpoint': 'your-storage-endpoint',
        'retention_days': 30
    }
)
```
