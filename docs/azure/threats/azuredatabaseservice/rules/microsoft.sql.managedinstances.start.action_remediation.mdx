- Implement access controls: Use the `az sql mi update` command to configure firewall rules and virtual network service endpoints for the managed instance. Restrict access to authorized IP addresses or virtual networks to comply with data protection regulations.

- Enable auditing and monitoring: Use the `az sql mi audit-policy update` command to enable auditing for the managed instance. Configure auditing for relevant databases or tables to track access and changes to the data, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized access: To remediate unauthorized access to Azure SQL Managed Instance, you can implement the following steps using Python:

- Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication: Instead of using SQL authentication, configure your Azure SQL Managed Instance to use Azure AD authentication. This ensures that only authorized users with valid Azure AD credentials can access the database service.

- Implement firewall rules: Configure firewall rules to restrict access to the Azure SQL Managed Instance. Whitelist specific IP addresses or IP ranges that are allowed to connect to the database service. This helps prevent unauthorized access from external sources.

- Regularly review and update access controls: Continuously monitor and review the access controls for your Azure SQL Managed Instance. Remove any unnecessary or unused user accounts, and regularly rotate passwords for privileged accounts. This helps minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

```python
# Example Python script to configure Azure AD authentication for Azure SQL Managed Instance
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

# Authenticate using Service Principal credentials
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id='<client_id>',
    secret='<client_secret>',
    tenant='<tenant_id>'
)

# Create SQL Management client
sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credentials, '<subscription_id>')

# Configure Azure AD authentication for Azure SQL Managed Instance
sql_client.managed_instances.begin_create_or_update(
    '<resource_group_name>',
    '<managed_instance_name>',
    {
        'identity': {
            'type': 'SystemAssigned'
        }
    }
)
```

2. Data exposure: To remediate data exposure in Azure SQL Managed Instance, you can implement the following steps using Python:

- Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE): TDE helps protect sensitive data at rest by encrypting the database files. Enable TDE for your Azure SQL Managed Instance to ensure that data is encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.

- Implement access control at the database level: Use Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to define granular access control policies for your databases. Assign appropriate roles and permissions to users and groups to restrict access to sensitive data.

- Regularly monitor and audit database activity: Implement logging and auditing mechanisms to track and monitor database activity. This helps detect any unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities related to data exposure.

```python
# Example Python script to enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for Azure SQL Managed Instance
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

# Authenticate using Service Principal credentials
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id='<client_id>',
    secret='<client_secret>',
    tenant='<tenant_id>'
)

# Create SQL Management client
sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credentials, '<subscription_id>')

# Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for Azure SQL Managed Instance
sql_client.transparent_data_encryptions.begin_create_or_update(
    '<resource_group_name>',
    '<managed_instance_name>',
    '<database_name>',
    {
        'status': 'Enabled'
    }
)
```

3. Compliance violations: To remediate compliance violations in Azure SQL Managed Instance, you can implement the following steps using Python:

- Implement encryption at rest and in transit: Ensure that data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. Enable TDE for Azure SQL Managed Instance to encrypt data at rest, and configure SSL/TLS encryption for data in transit.

- Implement access controls and auditing: Define and enforce access controls based on industry or regulatory standards. Use Azure RBAC to assign appropriate roles and permissions, and enable auditing to track and monitor access to sensitive data.

- Regularly review and update security configurations: Stay up to date with the latest security best practices and compliance requirements. Regularly review and update security configurations for your Azure SQL Managed Instance to ensure compliance with industry or regulatory standards.

```python
# Example Python script to enable SSL/TLS encryption for Azure SQL Managed Instance

# Authenticate using Service Principal credentials
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id='<client_id>',
    secret='<client_secret>',
    tenant='<tenant_id>'
)

# Create SQL Management client
sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credentials, '<subscription_id>')

# Enable SSL/TLS encryption for Azure SQL Managed Instance
sql_client.managed_instances.begin_create_or_update(
    '<resource_group_name>',
    '<managed_instance_name>',
    {
        'ssl_enforcement': 'Enabled'
    }
)
