#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized access, data breaches, and data integrity issues in Azure for Azure Database Service, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. Implement Access Control: Use the Azure SDK for Python to manage access control for your Azure Database Service. You can create and manage database users, roles, and permissions to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary access. Here's an example of how to create a user and assign permissions using the `azure-mgmt-rdbms` library:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.rdbms import MariaDBManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = MariaDBManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Create a user
client.server_usages.create_or_update(
    resource_group_name,
    server_name,
    'myuser',
    'password',
    'readwrite'
)
```

2. Enable Encryption: Enable encryption at rest and in transit to protect your data. You can use the `azure-mgmt-rdbms` library to enable encryption for your Azure Database Service. Here's an example of how to enable encryption at rest:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.rdbms import MariaDBManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = MariaDBManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Enable encryption at rest
client.servers.begin_create_or_update(
    resource_group_name,
    server_name,
    {
        "properties": {
            "storageProfile": {
                "storageEncryption": "Enabled"
            }
        }
    }
)
```

3. Implement Monitoring and Auditing: Use Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics to monitor and audit your Azure Database Service. You can configure alerts and log analytics queries to detect any suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts. Here's an example of how to create an alert rule using the `azure-mgmt-monitor` library:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Create an alert rule
client.alert_rules.create_or_update(
    resource_group_name,
    'myrule',
    {
        "location": "global",
        "enabled": True,
        "condition": {
            "odata.type": "Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.ThresholdRuleCondition",
            "dataSource": {
                "odata.type": "Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.RuleMetricDataSource",
                "resourceUri": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DBforMariaDB/servers/{serverName}",
                "metricName": "connections_failed",
                "operator": "GreaterThan",
                "threshold": 10,
                "timeAggregation": "Average",
                "windowSize": "PT5M"
            }
        },
        "actions": {
            "odata.type": "Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.RuleEmailAction",
            "sendToServiceOwners": True
        }
    }
)
```

These are just examples to get you started. You can further enhance the security of your Azure Database Service by implementing additional security measures such as network security groups, virtual network service endpoints, and threat detection.
