#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized access, data integrity compromise, and compliance violations in Azure Database Service for MariaDB using Python, you can utilize the Azure SDK for Python. Here are some example Python scripts to help you get started:

1. Unauthorized access:
   - Use the Azure Identity library to authenticate and obtain a token for Azure Resource Manager:
     ```python
     from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

     credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
     ```

   - Use the Azure Management SQL library to retrieve the list of databases and check for any unauthorized access:
     ```python
     from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient

     sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
     databases = sql_client.databases.list_by_server(resource_group_name, server_name)

     for database in databases:
         if "Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.databases.write" in database.permissions:
             # Take appropriate actions to investigate and address the unauthorized access
     ```

2. Data integrity compromise:
