### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.keys.delete event in AzureRealtime for AzureDatabaseService refers to the deletion of a key associated with a MariaDB server in Azure.
2. This event indicates that a key used for authentication and access control purposes has been removed from the MariaDB server.
3. It is important to monitor this event as it can help track any changes made to the security configuration of the MariaDB server and ensure that unauthorized access is prevented.

#### Example

1. Impact on Security: The Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.keys.delete event in AzureRealtime for AzureDatabaseService can potentially impact security if unauthorized access is gained to the database server's keys. This event indicates that a key associated with the MariaDB server in Azure has been deleted, which could potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database.

2. Example Scenario: An example scenario where security could be impacted is if a malicious user gains access to the Azure portal or has compromised credentials of a user with sufficient privileges. They could then delete the keys associated with the MariaDB server, effectively revoking access for legitimate users and potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database.

3. Remediation: To mitigate the impact of this event and ensure the security of the Azure Database Service, the following steps can be taken:

- Enable Azure Active Directory authentication for the MariaDB server to ensure that only authorized users can access the server.
- Regularly monitor the Azure portal for any suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.
- Implement strong access control measures, such as using role-based access control (RBAC) to limit the privileges of users and regularly reviewing and revoking unnecessary permissions.
- Enable auditing and logging for the Azure Database Service to track any changes or deletions of keys and investigate any suspicious activities.
- Regularly backup the database and its associated keys to ensure data availability and recoverability in case of any security incidents.

Azure CLI command to enable Azure Active Directory authentication for MariaDB server:

```
az mariadb server ad-admin create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server-name <server-name> --tenant-id <tenant-id> --object-id <object-id>
```

Note: Replace `<resource-group-name>`, `<server-name>`, `<tenant-id>`, and `<object-id>` with the appropriate values for your environment.
