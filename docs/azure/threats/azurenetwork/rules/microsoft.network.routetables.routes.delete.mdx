### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The Microsoft.Network.routeTables.routes.delete event in AzureNetwork indicates that a route has been deleted from a route table in the Azure network.
2. This event signifies a change in the routing configuration of the Azure network, where a specific route has been removed from a route table.
3. It is important to monitor this event to track any modifications made to the routing infrastructure, as it can impact the network traffic flow within the Azure environment.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Network.routeTables.routes.delete in Azure for AzureNetwork, it means that a route is being deleted from a route table in the Azure network. This can potentially disrupt network connectivity and compromise the security of the network.

To remediate this issue for AzureNetwork using the Azure portal, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) using your Azure credentials.
2. Navigate to the AzureNetwork resource that is affected by the security impact.
3. In the left-hand menu, click on "Route tables" under the "Settings" section.
4. Identify the route table that is impacted by the deletion of routes.
5. Click on the route table to open its details.
6. In the route table details page, click on the "Routes" tab.
7. Review the existing routes and identify the route that was deleted.
8. Click on the "Add" button to add a new route.
9. Provide the necessary details for the new route, such as destination prefix, next hop type, and next hop IP address.
10. Click on the "OK" button to save the new route.
11. Repeat steps 8-10 if multiple routes were deleted.
12. Once all the necessary routes have been added, verify the network connectivity and ensure that the security impact has been remediated.

Note: It is important to regularly monitor and review the route tables in AzureNetwork to detect any unauthorized or unintended changes to the routes. Additionally, consider implementing appropriate access controls and permissions to prevent unauthorized modifications to the route tables.

#### Using CLI

1. Impact on Security: The `Microsoft.Network.routeTables.routes.delete` operation in Azure can impact security by deleting a route from a route table associated with an Azure network. This can potentially disrupt network connectivity and lead to unauthorized access or data breaches if critical routes are mistakenly deleted.

2. Example: Let's say you have a route table in Azure that contains a route directing traffic to a specific subnet or virtual network. If the `Microsoft.Network.routeTables.routes.delete` operation is used to delete this route, it can result in network traffic being misrouted or blocked, potentially compromising the security of the affected resources.

3. Remediation using Azure CLI: To remediate this issue and restore the security of the Azure network, you can use the Azure CLI to recreate the deleted route. Here are the CLI commands to achieve this:

   ```bash
   # Retrieve the details of the route table
   az network route-table show --name <route_table_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name>

   # Create a new route with the required configuration
   az network route-table route create --name <new_route_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --route-table-name <route_table_name> --address-prefix <destination_address_prefix> --next-hop-type <next_hop_type> --next-hop-ip-address <next_hop_ip_address>
   ```

   Replace the placeholders `<route_table_name>`, `<resource_group_name>`, `<new_route_name>`, `<destination_address_prefix>`, `<next_hop_type>`, and `<next_hop_ip_address>` with the actual values specific to your Azure environment. By recreating the deleted route using the Azure CLI, you can restore the necessary network connectivity and mitigate the security impact caused by the deletion.
