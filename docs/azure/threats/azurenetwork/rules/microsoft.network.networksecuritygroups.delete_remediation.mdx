### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The Microsoft.Network.networkSecurityGroups.delete event in AzureRealtime for AzureNetwork indicates that a network security group (NSG) has been deleted in the Azure network.
2. This event signifies that the NSG rules and configurations associated with the deleted NSG will no longer be enforced on the associated subnets or network interfaces.
3. It is important to review the reason for the deletion and ensure that any necessary security measures are in place to protect the affected resources, such as implementing alternative NSGs or adjusting network security configurations.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.Network.networkSecurityGroups.delete event occurs in Azure, it means that a network security group (NSG) has been deleted. This can have a significant security impact as NSGs are used to control inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources. Without an NSG, the associated resources may become exposed to unauthorized access or malicious activities.

2. Remediation steps:
   - Identify the affected resources: Use Azure CLI command `az network nsg list` to list all the NSGs in the subscription and identify the deleted NSG.
   - Restore the deleted NSG: If the NSG was deleted by mistake, it can be restored using the Azure CLI command `az network nsg create`. Provide the necessary parameters such as resource group, name, and location to recreate the NSG.
   - Reapply NSG rules: Once the NSG is restored, ensure that the necessary inbound and outbound security rules are reconfigured to control the traffic to the associated resources. Use the Azure CLI command `az network nsg rule create` to add rules to the NSG.

3. Preventive measures:
   - Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Assign appropriate roles and permissions to users and groups to prevent accidental deletion of NSGs by unauthorized individuals.
   - Enable NSG deletion protection: Enable the deletion protection feature for NSGs to prevent accidental deletions. This can be done using the Azure Portal or the Azure CLI command `az network nsg update --name <nsg-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --set properties.enableDeleteProtection=true`.
