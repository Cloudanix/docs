### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Network.publicIPAddresses.delete event in AzureRealTime for AzureNetwork indicates that a public IP address resource has been deleted in the Azure network.
- This event signifies that the public IP address associated with a specific Azure resource, such as a virtual machine or a load balancer, has been removed.
- It is important to monitor this event as it can impact the connectivity and accessibility of the associated Azure resources, and may require reconfiguration or allocation of a new public IP address.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with Microsoft.Network.publicIPAddresses.delete event in Azure:

- If an unauthorized user gains access to the Azure portal or has the necessary permissions, they can delete a public IP address associated with a resource in Azure. This can lead to a loss of connectivity or disruption of services that rely on the public IP address.

2. Remediation for the security impact:

- Implement strong access controls and permissions management to ensure that only authorized users have the ability to delete public IP addresses.
- Enable Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication for the Azure portal to add an extra layer of security.
- Regularly monitor and review audit logs and alerts to detect any unauthorized access or deletion of public IP addresses.

3. Azure CLI command for retrieving the audit logs related to public IP address deletion:

```
az monitor activity-log list --resource-type Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses --query "[?operationName.value == 'Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/delete']"
```
