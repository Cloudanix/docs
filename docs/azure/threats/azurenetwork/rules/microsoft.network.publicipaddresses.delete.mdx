### Event Information

1. The Microsoft.Network.publicIPAddresses.delete event in Azure for AzureNetwork indicates that a public IP address associated with a network resource in Azure is being deleted.
2. This event signifies that the public IP address is no longer required or is being replaced with a different IP address.
3. It is important to monitor this event to ensure that any dependencies or configurations relying on the deleted public IP address are updated accordingly to avoid any disruption in network connectivity.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Network.publicIPAddresses.delete in Azure for AzureNetwork, it could potentially lead to unauthorized deletion of public IP addresses. This can result in disruption of network connectivity for resources associated with those IP addresses, leading to potential service outages or unauthorized access to resources.

2. IP address hijacking: Another security impact could be IP address hijacking. If an attacker gains access to delete public IP addresses in AzureNetwork, they can potentially take over the IP addresses and redirect traffic to malicious destinations. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, or disruption of services.

3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: Deleting public IP addresses in AzureNetwork can also be exploited to launch Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. By deleting critical IP addresses, an attacker can disrupt network connectivity for legitimate users or services, causing service unavailability and potential financial losses.

To mitigate these security impacts, it is important to implement proper access controls, such as role-based access control (RBAC), to restrict the deletion of public IP addresses to authorized personnel only. Regular monitoring and auditing of network resources can also help detect any unauthorized deletion attempts and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risks.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion, IP address hijacking, and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in Azure for AzureNetwork using the Azure console, follow these steps:

1. Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Ensure that proper access controls are in place to restrict the permissions for deleting public IP addresses. Assign roles and permissions to users or groups based on the principle of least privilege. Only authorized personnel should have the ability to delete public IP addresses.

2. Enable Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs): NSGs provide network-level security by allowing or denying inbound and outbound traffic to resources. Configure NSGs to restrict access to public IP addresses and prevent unauthorized deletion. Create rules that allow only necessary traffic and block any suspicious or malicious activity.

3. Enable Azure DDoS Protection: Azure DDoS Protection helps mitigate and prevent DoS attacks by automatically detecting and mitigating volumetric, state-exhaustion, and application layer attacks. Enable DDoS Protection for your AzureNetwork to safeguard against potential DoS attacks that could be launched by deleting public IP addresses.

By following these steps, you can enhance the security of your AzureNetwork and mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized deletion, IP address hijacking, and DoS attacks.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unauthorized deletion, IP address hijacking, and DoS attacks in Azure for AzureNetwork, you can use the Azure CLI with the following commands:

1. Unauthorized deletion:
   - Identify the affected public IP addresses: `az network public-ip list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --query "[?contains(name, 'AzureNetwork')]" --output table`
   - Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to restrict access to public IP addresses: `az role assignment create --assignee <user-or-group-id> --role "Network Contributor" --scope <public-ip-resource-id>`

2. IP address hijacking:
   - Monitor public IP address changes: `az monitor activity-log list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --resource-type Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses --query "[?contains(properties.statusCode, 'Deleted')]" --output table`
   - Enable Azure DDoS Protection Standard to mitigate potential attacks: `az network ddos-protection update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <public-ip-name> --ddos-protection-plan "Basic_DDoS_Protection"`

3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:
   - Enable Azure DDoS Protection Standard to mitigate potential attacks: `az network ddos-protection update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <public-ip-name> --ddos-protection-plan "Basic_DDoS_Protection"`
   - Implement Azure Firewall or Network Security Groups (NSGs) to filter and block malicious traffic: `az network firewall create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <firewall-name> --location <location>`

Note: Replace `<resource-group-name>`, `<public-ip-resource-id>`, `<user-or-group-id>`, `<public-ip-name>`, `<firewall-name>`, and `<location>` with the appropriate values specific to your Azure environment.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion, IP address hijacking, and DoS attacks in Azure for AzureNetwork, you can use the Azure Python SDK to implement the following steps:

1. Unauthorized deletion:
   - Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to restrict permissions for deleting public IP addresses. Assign only necessary permissions to trusted users or groups.
   - Monitor and audit the deletion of public IP addresses using Azure Monitor or Azure Security Center. Set up alerts to notify administrators of any unauthorized deletion attempts.
   - Regularly backup public IP addresses using Azure Automation or Azure CLI to quickly restore them in case of accidental or malicious deletion.

2. IP address hijacking:
   - Enable Azure DDoS Protection Standard for AzureNetwork to detect and mitigate IP address hijacking attempts.
   - Implement Network Security Groups (NSGs) to restrict inbound and outbound traffic to and from public IP addresses. Configure NSGs to allow only trusted sources and protocols.
   - Regularly monitor network traffic and analyze logs to identify any suspicious activities or traffic redirection attempts.

3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:
   - Implement Azure DDoS Protection Standard for AzureNetwork to detect and mitigate DoS attacks targeting public IP addresses.
   - Configure Azure Firewall or Azure Application Gateway to provide additional protection against DoS attacks.
   - Implement rate limiting and traffic filtering rules to prevent excessive traffic or malicious requests from reaching public IP addresses.

Please note that the provided steps are high-level recommendations, and you may need to adapt them based on your specific requirements and Azure environment.
