### Event Information

1. The Microsoft.Network.virtualNetworks.subnets.delete event in Azure for AzureNetwork indicates that a subnet within a virtual network has been deleted.
2. This event signifies that any resources or services associated with the deleted subnet will no longer be accessible.
3. It is important to review the details of this event to understand the impact on network connectivity and any dependencies on the deleted subnet.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of subnets: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Network.virtualNetworks.subnets.delete in Azure for AzureNetwork, it could potentially lead to unauthorized deletion of subnets within the virtual network. This can result in disruption of network connectivity and potential loss of data if critical resources are hosted within those subnets.

2. Network misconfiguration: Deleting subnets without proper planning and coordination can lead to network misconfiguration. This can result in connectivity issues between resources within the virtual network, affecting the availability and performance of applications and services.

3. Access control vulnerabilities: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Network.virtualNetworks.subnets.delete, it could indicate a potential vulnerability in access control mechanisms. Unauthorized users or malicious actors may be able to delete subnets, bypassing proper authorization and authentication processes. This can lead to unauthorized access to resources or even complete network compromise.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. To remediate unauthorized deletion of subnets in Azure using the Azure console, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Identify the affected subnet(s) within the AzureNetwork virtual network.
- Step 2: Review the audit logs and activity logs in Azure Monitor to gather information about the unauthorized deletion event.
- Step 3: Restore the deleted subnet(s) using the Azure portal or Azure CLI.
- Step 4: Investigate the root cause of the unauthorized deletion, such as misconfigured access controls or compromised user accounts.
- Step 5: Implement appropriate access controls and security measures to prevent future unauthorized deletions, such as role-based access control (RBAC) and network security groups (NSGs).
- Step 6: Monitor and regularly review the audit logs and activity logs to detect any suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.

2. To remediate network misconfiguration in Azure when deleting subnets, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Before deleting any subnets, ensure that you have a clear understanding of the network topology and dependencies between resources within the virtual network.
- Step 2: Update the network documentation to reflect the planned changes and ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the impact.
- Step 3: Coordinate with the relevant teams or individuals to schedule a maintenance window for the subnet deletion.
- Step 4: During the maintenance window, delete the subnets one by one, ensuring that there are no active connections or dependencies on the subnets being deleted.
- Step 5: Monitor the network connectivity and performance after the subnet deletion to ensure that there are no issues or disruptions.
- Step 6: Regularly review and update the network configuration to align with the evolving requirements of the applications and services hosted within the virtual network.

3. To remediate access control vulnerabilities in Azure related to subnet deletion, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Review and update the access control policies and permissions associated with the AzureNetwork virtual network and its subnets.
- Step 2: Implement the principle of least privilege by granting only the necessary permissions to users and roles.
- Step 3: Regularly review and audit the access control configurations to identify any misconfigurations or overly permissive access.
- Step 4: Enable Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user accounts with administrative privileges.
- Step 5: Implement network security groups (NSGs) to restrict inbound and outbound traffic to the subnets based on the principle of least privilege.
- Step 6: Monitor and analyze the audit logs and activity logs to detect any suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts, and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risks.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate unauthorized deletion of subnets in Azure using Azure CLI, you can take the following steps:
   - Identify the deleted subnet by checking the Azure Activity Log or using Azure Monitor.
   - Restore the deleted subnet using the `az network vnet subnet create` command, specifying the appropriate parameters such as the virtual network name, subnet name, and address prefix.

   Example command:
   ```
   az network vnet subnet create --name <subnet-name> --vnet-name <virtual-network-name> --address-prefix <subnet-address-prefix>
   ```

2. To remediate network misconfiguration caused by deleting subnets without proper planning, you can follow these steps:
   - Review the network topology and identify the desired subnet configuration.
   - Recreate the deleted subnet using the `az network vnet subnet create` command, ensuring that the subnet configuration aligns with the intended network design.

   Example command:
   ```
   az network vnet subnet create --name <subnet-name> --vnet-name <virtual-network-name> --address-prefix <subnet-address-prefix>
   ```

3. To address access control vulnerabilities related to unauthorized subnet deletion, you can take the following actions:
   - Review and update the access control policies for the virtual network and subnets using Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
   - Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete subnets.
   - Regularly monitor and audit the access control configurations to identify any potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

   Example command to assign a role to a user or group:
   ```
   az role assignment create --assignee <user-or-group-id> --role <role-name> --scope <subnet-resource-id>
   ```

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of subnets in Azure using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Monitor and detect unauthorized deletion: Implement Azure Monitor to track and log activities related to subnet deletion. You can use Azure Monitor Logs and create a query to identify any suspicious or unauthorized deletion events.

```python
from azure.monitor.query import LogsQueryClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = LogsQueryClient(credential)

query = """
AzureActivity
| where OperationName == "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/delete"
| where ResourceGroupName == "AzureNetwork"
| where ResultType == "Success"
"""

response = client.query_workspace("{workspace_id}", query)
for row in response.tables[0].rows:
    print(row)
```

2. Implement RBAC and access controls: Ensure that proper Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is in place to restrict the deletion of subnets to authorized users only. Assign appropriate roles to users or groups based on their responsibilities and limit the permissions to delete subnets.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.authorization import AuthorizationManagementClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = AuthorizationManagementClient(credential, "{subscription_id}")

role_assignment = client.role_assignments.create(
    scope="/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/AzureNetwork",
    role_definition_id="/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/{role_definition_id}",
    principal_id="{principal_id}"
)
```

3. Implement backup and recovery mechanisms: Regularly backup the virtual network configuration, including subnets, using Azure Backup or other backup solutions. This ensures that even if a subnet is accidentally deleted, it can be restored quickly without significant impact on network connectivity.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.recoveryservices import RecoveryServicesClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = RecoveryServicesClient(credential, "{subscription_id}")

backup_policy = client.backup_policies.get(
    "{resource_group_name}",
    "{vault_name}",
    "{policy_name}"
)

backup_item = client.backup_items.get(
    "{resource_group_name}",
    "{vault_name}",
    "{backup_item_name}"
)

recovery_point = client.recovery_points.list(
    "{resource_group_name}",
    "{vault_name}",
    "{backup_item_name}"
)

# Restore the deleted subnet using the recovery point
```

Note: Replace the placeholders ({workspace_id}, {subscription_id}, {role_definition_id}, {principal_id}, {resource_group_name}, {vault_name}, {policy_name}, {backup_item_name}) with the actual values specific to your Azure environment.
