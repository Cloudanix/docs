### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Network.virtualNetworks.subnets.delete event in AzureRealTime for AzureNetwork indicates that a subnet within a virtual network in Azure has been deleted.
- This event signifies that a specific subnet, along with its associated resources and configurations, has been removed from the virtual network.
- It is important to note that deleting a subnet will also remove any resources or services that were deployed within that subnet, so caution should be exercised when performing this action.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with Microsoft.Network.virtualNetworks.subnets.delete event in Azure:

- If an unauthorized user gains access to the Azure portal or has elevated privileges, they can potentially delete a subnet within a virtual network. This can lead to disruption of network connectivity and potential security breaches, as resources within the subnet may become inaccessible.

2. Remediation steps for mitigating the impact of Microsoft.Network.virtualNetworks.subnets.delete event in Azure:

- Implement strict access controls and role-based access control (RBAC) to limit the number of users with delete permissions on subnets. Only authorized personnel should have the ability to delete subnets.
- Enable Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template deployments for virtual networks and subnets, which can help in automating the deployment process and reducing the risk of manual errors or unauthorized deletions.
- Regularly monitor and audit the Azure activity logs and set up alerts for any subnet deletion events. This will help in detecting any unauthorized activities and taking immediate action.

Example Azure CLI command to create a subnet with specific security controls:

```
az network vnet subnet create --name <subnet-name> --vnet-name <vnet-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --address-prefix <subnet-address-prefix> --network-security-group <nsg-name> --service-endpoints <service-endpoints>
```

Note: Replace `<subnet-name>`, `<vnet-name>`, `<resource-group-name>`, `<subnet-address-prefix>`, `<nsg-name>`, and `<service-endpoints>` with the appropriate values for your environment.

Example Azure PowerShell script to create a subnet with specific security controls:

```powershell
$subnet = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name <subnet-name> -AddressPrefix <subnet-address-prefix> -NetworkSecurityGroup <nsg-name> -ServiceEndpoint <service-endpoints>
$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name <vnet-name> -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name>
$vnet | Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $subnet.Name -AddressPrefix $subnet.AddressPrefix -NetworkSecurityGroup $subnet.NetworkSecurityGroup -ServiceEndpoint $subnet.ServiceEndpoint
Set-AzVirtualNetwork -VirtualNetwork $vnet
```

Note: Replace `<subnet-name>`, `<vnet-name>`, `<resource-group-name>`, `<subnet-address-prefix>`, `<nsg-name>`, and `<service-endpoints>` with the appropriate values for your environment.
