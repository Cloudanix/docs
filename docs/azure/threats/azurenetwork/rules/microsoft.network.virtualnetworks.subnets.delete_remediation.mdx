### Event Information

1. The Microsoft.Network.virtualNetworks.subnets.delete event in Azure for AzureNetwork indicates that a subnet within a virtual network has been deleted.
2. This event signifies that any resources or services associated with the deleted subnet will no longer be accessible.
3. It is important to review the details of this event to understand the specific subnet that was deleted and any potential impact on connected resources or services.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of subnets: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Network.virtualNetworks.subnets.delete in Azure for AzureNetwork, it could potentially lead to unauthorized deletion of subnets within the virtual network. This can result in disruption of network connectivity and services that rely on those subnets.

2. Data exposure: Deleting subnets without proper authorization or understanding of the network architecture can lead to unintended data exposure. If a subnet contains sensitive data or resources, deleting it without proper precautions can result in unauthorized access to that data.

3. Network misconfiguration: Deleting subnets without proper planning and understanding of the network dependencies can lead to network misconfiguration. This can result in loss of connectivity between resources, disruption of network traffic, and potential security vulnerabilities. It is important to carefully assess the impact of subnet deletion and ensure proper backup and recovery mechanisms are in place before performing such actions.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the unauthorized deletion of subnets in Azure using the Azure console, follow these steps:

1. Enable Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Ensure that RBAC is enabled for your Azure subscription to control access to resources. This will help prevent unauthorized users from deleting subnets. To enable RBAC, follow these steps:
   - Go to the Azure portal and navigate to the subscription that contains the AzureNetwork.
   - Click on "Access control (IAM)" in the left-hand menu.
   - Click on "Add" and select the appropriate role (e.g., Contributor) for the user or group that needs access.
   - Specify the user or group and click on "Save" to grant the role.

2. Implement resource locks: Resource locks can be used to prevent accidental deletion of subnets. To implement a resource lock, follow these steps:
   - Go to the Azure portal and navigate to the AzureNetwork.
   - Click on "Locks" in the left-hand menu.
   - Click on "Add" and provide a name and description for the lock.
   - Select the appropriate lock level (e.g., CanNotDelete) to prevent deletion of the subnet.
   - Click on "OK" to apply the lock.

3. Regularly monitor and audit subnet changes: Implement a monitoring and auditing solution to track changes made to subnets. This will help identify any unauthorized deletion attempts and allow for timely remediation. Azure provides various monitoring and auditing tools, such as Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center, which can be used to track and analyze subnet changes.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of subnets in Azure and ensure the security and availability of your resources.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate unauthorized deletion of subnets in Azure for AzureNetwork, you can use the Azure CLI commands to restore the deleted subnets:

```
az network vnet subnet create --name <subnet-name> --vnet-name <vnet-name> --address-prefix <subnet-address-prefix>
```

This command will recreate the deleted subnet within the specified virtual network, ensuring network connectivity is restored for the affected resources.

2. To remediate misconfiguration of network security groups after deleting subnets, you can update the NSG rules to reflect the changes in the network topology. Use the following Azure CLI command to update the NSG rules:

```
az network nsg rule update --name <rule-name> --nsg-name <nsg-name> --access <access-type> --destination-address-prefix <destination-address-prefix> --destination-port-range <destination-port-range> --direction <direction> --priority <priority> --protocol <protocol> --source-address-prefix <source-address-prefix> --source-port-range <source-port-range>
```

Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values for the NSG rule that needs to be updated. This will ensure that the network security groups are properly configured after deleting subnets.

3. To mitigate the impact on network segmentation and isolation caused by deleting subnets without proper consideration, you can recreate the deleted subnets and update the network routing accordingly. Use the following Azure CLI command to update the network routing:

```
az network vnet subnet update --name <subnet-name> --vnet-name <vnet-name> --route-table <route-table-name>
```

Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values for the subnet and virtual network. This command will associate the specified route table with the subnet, ensuring proper network segmentation and isolation are maintained.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of subnets in Azure for AzureNetwork using Python scripts, you can:

1. Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete subnets. You can use the Azure SDK for Python to manage RBAC roles and assign appropriate permissions to users or service principals.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.authorization import AuthorizationManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create an instance of the AuthorizationManagementClient
authorization_client = AuthorizationManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Assign the necessary role to the user or service principal
authorization_client.role_assignments.create(scope, role_definition_id, principal_id)
```

2. Enable Azure Network Watcher: Azure Network Watcher provides network monitoring and diagnostic capabilities. By enabling it, you can detect and alert on any unauthorized deletion of subnets. You can use the Azure SDK for Python to enable Network Watcher for your virtual network.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create an instance of the NetworkManagementClient
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Enable Network Watcher for the virtual network
network_client.network_watchers.create_or_update(resource_group_name, network_watcher_name, {})
```

3. Implement Azure Policy: Azure Policy allows you to define and enforce compliance rules for your Azure resources. You can create a policy that restricts the deletion of subnets without proper justification or approval. You can use the Azure SDK for Python to create and assign the policy to your subscription.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.resourcepolicy import PolicyClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create an instance of the PolicyClient
policy_client = PolicyClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Create a policy definition that restricts subnet deletion
policy_definition = policy_client.policy_definitions.create_or_update(policy_definition_name, policy_definition)

# Assign the policy to the subscription
policy_assignment = policy_client.policy_assignments.create(scope, policy_assignment_name, policy_assignment)
```

By implementing these measures, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of subnets in Azure and ensure the security and integrity of your network infrastructure.
