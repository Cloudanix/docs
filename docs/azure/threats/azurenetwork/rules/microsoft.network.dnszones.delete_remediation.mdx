### Event Information

1. The Microsoft.Network.dnszones.delete event in Azure for AzureNetwork indicates that a DNS zone has been deleted within the Azure Network.
2. This event signifies that the DNS zone, which is used for managing the domain name resolution within the Azure Network, has been removed.
3. It is important to note that deleting a DNS zone can have implications on the name resolution and connectivity within the Azure Network, so it should be done with caution and proper planning.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Network.dnszones.delete in Azure for AzureNetwork, it could mean that an unauthorized user or entity has gained access to the Azure Network and is able to delete DNS zones. This could lead to a loss of DNS resolution for the affected network, potentially impacting the availability and accessibility of services hosted within the network.

2. Data loss: Deleting DNS zones without proper authorization or understanding of the impact can result in the loss of important DNS records. This can lead to service disruptions, as DNS records are crucial for resolving domain names to IP addresses. It may take time and effort to recreate the deleted DNS zones and restore the necessary records, potentially causing downtime for the affected services.

3. DNS hijacking: If security is compromised and an unauthorized entity is able to delete DNS zones in Azure, it opens up the possibility of DNS hijacking. An attacker could delete or modify DNS records to redirect traffic to malicious destinations, potentially leading to data breaches, phishing attacks, or other security incidents. This can have serious consequences for the affected organization, including reputational damage and financial losses.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of DNS zones in Azure for AzureNetwork using the Azure console, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Identify the unauthorized deletion: Monitor your Azure Network for any suspicious activities or unexpected changes in DNS zones. This can be done by regularly reviewing activity logs, audit logs, and security alerts in the Azure portal.

- Step 2: Disable the unauthorized user or entity: If an unauthorized user or entity is identified, take immediate action to disable their access to the Azure Network. This can be done by revoking their permissions or disabling their user account.

- Step 3: Restore the deleted DNS zones: Once the unauthorized access has been mitigated, restore the deleted DNS zones from a backup or a previous configuration. This can be done by accessing the DNS zone backups or using version control systems to revert to a previous state.

2. Data loss: To remediate data loss due to unauthorized deletion of DNS zones in Azure for AzureNetwork using the Azure console, follow these steps:

- Step 3: Enhance security measures: Implement additional security measures to prevent future DNS hijacking incidents. This can include enabling multi-factor authentication, regularly reviewing and updating access controls, and monitoring DNS zone activities for any anomalies or unauthorized changes.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unauthorized deletion of DNS zones in Azure for AzureNetwork, you can follow these steps using Azure CLI commands:

1. Identify the unauthorized deletion: 
   - Use Azure Monitor or Azure Security Center to detect any suspicious activities related to DNS zone deletions.
   - Review the Azure Activity Log to identify the user or entity responsible for the unauthorized deletion.

2. Restore the deleted DNS zones:
   - Retrieve the details of the deleted DNS zones using the Azure CLI command:
     ```
     az network dns zone list-deleted --resource-group <resource-group-name>
     ```
   - Select the deleted DNS zone that needs to be restored and retrieve its details.
   - Restore the deleted DNS zone using the Azure CLI command:
     ```
     az network dns zone recover --name <zone-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>
     ```

3. Enhance security and access controls:
   - Review and update the access controls for the Azure Network and DNS zones to prevent unauthorized deletions.
   - Implement Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to manage DNS zones.
   - Enable Azure AD authentication for DNS zone management to add an additional layer of security.

Note: It is recommended to regularly monitor and review the Azure Activity Log and implement proactive security measures to prevent unauthorized access and deletion of DNS zones.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of DNS zones in Azure for AzureNetwork using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Ensure that proper RBAC roles and permissions are assigned to users and entities accessing the Azure Network. Limit the delete permission for DNS zones to only authorized individuals or groups.

```python
from azure.mgmt.authorization import AuthorizationManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.authorization.models import RoleAssignmentCreateParameters

def assign_role_to_user(resource_group_name, network_name, user_principal_id, role_definition_id):
    authorization_client = AuthorizationManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
    
    role_assignment = RoleAssignmentCreateParameters(
        role_definition_id=role_definition_id,
        principal_id=user_principal_id
    )
    
    authorization_client.role_assignments.create(
        scope=f"/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group_name}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{network_name}",
        role_assignment_name="DNS Zone Deletion",
        parameters=role_assignment
    )
```

2. Enable Azure Monitor for DNS: Set up Azure Monitor to track and log DNS zone deletions. This will allow you to detect any unauthorized deletion attempts and take appropriate action.

```python
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import DiagnosticSettingsResource, LogSettings

def enable_dns_zone_deletion_logs(resource_group_name, network_name, workspace_id):
    monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
    
    log_settings = LogSettings(
        category="DnsZoneDelete",
        enabled=True
    )
    
    diagnostic_settings = DiagnosticSettingsResource(
        workspace_id=workspace_id,
        logs=[log_settings]
    )
    
    monitor_client.diagnostic_settings.create_or_update(
        resource_uri=f"/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group_name}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{network_name}",
        name="DNS Zone Deletion Logs",
        parameters=diagnostic_settings
    )
```

3. Implement Azure Policy: Create an Azure Policy to enforce the prevention of unauthorized DNS zone deletions. This policy can be applied at the subscription or resource group level to ensure compliance.

```python
from azure.mgmt.resourcepolicy import PolicyClient
from azure.mgmt.resourcepolicy.models import PolicyDefinition, PolicyRule, PolicyMode

def create_dns_zone_deletion_policy(policy_name, policy_description):
    policy_client = PolicyClient(credentials, subscription_id)
    
    policy_rule = PolicyRule(
        if_conditions={
            "field": "type",
            "equals": "Microsoft.Network/dnszones/delete"
        },
        then={
            "effect": "deny"
        }
    )
    
    policy_definition = PolicyDefinition(
        policy_type="Custom",
        display_name=policy_name,
        description=policy_description,
        mode=PolicyMode.all,
        policy_rule=policy_rule
    )
    
    policy_client.policy_definitions.create_or_update(
        policy_definition_name=policy_name,
        parameters=policy_definition
    )
```

These Python scripts demonstrate how to assign RBAC roles, enable Azure Monitor for DNS, and create an Azure Policy to prevent unauthorized deletion of DNS zones in Azure for AzureNetwork.
