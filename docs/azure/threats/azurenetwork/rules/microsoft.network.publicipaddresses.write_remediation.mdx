### Event Information

- The Microsoft.Network.publicIPAddresses.write event in Azure for AzureNetwork refers to the action of creating or updating a public IP address resource within the Azure Network.
- This event indicates that a change has been made to the public IP address configuration, such as assigning a new IP address or modifying the settings of an existing IP address.
- It is important to monitor this event as it can help track any changes made to the public IP addresses associated with the Azure Network, ensuring proper management and security of network resources.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized modification of public IP addresses: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Network.publicIPAddresses.write permission in Azure for AzureNetwork, it could potentially allow unauthorized users to modify the public IP addresses associated with the Azure Network. This could lead to unauthorized access to resources or services hosted on the network.

2. IP address hijacking: With the ability to write to public IP addresses, an attacker could potentially hijack an IP address associated with the Azure Network. This could result in redirecting traffic intended for legitimate services to malicious destinations, leading to data breaches or service disruptions.

3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: By modifying public IP addresses, an attacker could potentially launch DoS attacks against the Azure Network. This could involve overwhelming the network with a high volume of traffic or exploiting vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure, leading to service unavailability for legitimate users.

It is important to carefully manage and restrict permissions related to public IP address management in Azure to mitigate these security risks.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized modification of public IP addresses in Azure for AzureNetwork, you can follow these steps:

1. Review and update network security groups: Ensure that network security groups (NSGs) are properly configured to restrict access to the AzureNetwork. This includes allowing only necessary inbound and outbound traffic and blocking any unauthorized modifications to public IP addresses.

2. Implement role-based access control (RBAC): Use RBAC to assign appropriate permissions to users and groups. Specifically, limit the Microsoft.Network.publicIPAddresses.write permission to only authorized individuals or roles. This will prevent unauthorized users from modifying public IP addresses associated with the AzureNetwork.

3. Enable Azure Firewall or Azure DDoS Protection: Consider implementing additional security measures such as Azure Firewall or Azure DDoS Protection to protect against IP address hijacking and DoS attacks. These services can help detect and mitigate malicious traffic targeting the AzureNetwork.

By following these steps, you can effectively remediate the security risks associated with unauthorized modification of public IP addresses in Azure for AzureNetwork.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unauthorized modification of public IP addresses in Azure for AzureNetwork, you can follow these steps using Azure CLI:

1. Restrict permissions: Review and modify the permissions associated with the Microsoft.Network.publicIPAddresses.write permission for AzureNetwork. Ensure that only authorized users or roles have this permission. You can use the following command to remove the permission for a specific role:

```
az role assignment delete --role "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/write" --assignee <assignee> --scope /subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<virtual_network>/subnets/<subnet>
```

Replace `<assignee>` with the identity or principal ID of the user or role that needs to have the permission removed. Replace `<subscription_id>`, `<resource_group>`, `<virtual_network>`, and `<subnet>` with the appropriate values for your Azure environment.

2. Enable Azure Firewall: Consider implementing Azure Firewall to provide additional security controls for your Azure Network. Azure Firewall can help prevent unauthorized access and protect against IP address hijacking. You can create an Azure Firewall using the following command:

```
az network firewall create --name <firewall_name> --resource-group <resource_group> --location <location>
```

Replace `<firewall_name>`, `<resource_group>`, and `<location>` with the desired values for your Azure environment.

3. Implement network security groups (NSGs): Configure NSGs to restrict inbound and outbound traffic to and from your Azure Network. This can help mitigate the risk of DoS attacks by limiting the volume of traffic and protecting against known vulnerabilities. You can create and associate NSGs with your Azure Network using the following command:

```
az network nsg create --name <nsg_name> --resource-group <resource_group> --location <location>
az network vnet subnet update --name <subnet_name> --vnet-name <virtual_network> --resource-group <resource_group> --network-security-group <nsg_name>
```

Replace `<nsg_name>`, `<resource_group>`, `<location>`, `<subnet_name>`, and `<virtual_network>` with the appropriate values for your Azure environment.

By following these steps, you can remediate unauthorized modification of public IP addresses, prevent IP address hijacking, and mitigate the risk of DoS attacks in Azure for AzureNetwork.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized modification of public IP addresses in Azure AzureNetwork using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected public IP addresses: Use the Azure SDK for Python (azure-mgmt-network) to retrieve a list of public IP addresses associated with the AzureNetwork.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

public_ips = network_client.public_ip_addresses.list(resource_group_name, filter="resourceType eq 'Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses'")
for public_ip in public_ips:
    print(public_ip.name)
```

2. Remove write permissions for unauthorized users: Use the Azure SDK for Python to update the role assignments for the public IP addresses, removing the Microsoft.Network.publicIPAddresses.write permission for unauthorized users.

```python
from azure.mgmt.authorization import AuthorizationManagementClient

authorization_client = AuthorizationManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

role_assignments = authorization_client.role_assignments.list_for_resource(resource_group_name, resource_provider_namespace='Microsoft.Network', resource_type='publicIPAddresses')
for role_assignment in role_assignments:
    if role_assignment.role_definition_id == 'Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/write' and role_assignment.principal_id == unauthorized_user_id:
        authorization_client.role_assignments.delete(resource_group_name, role_assignment.name)
```

3. Implement access controls and monitoring: Enhance the security of the AzureNetwork by implementing access controls, such as network security groups and virtual network service endpoints. Additionally, enable logging and monitoring to detect any unauthorized modifications or suspicious activities related to public IP addresses.

Note: Replace the placeholders (e.g., subscription_id, resource_group_name, unauthorized_user_id) with the actual values specific to your Azure environment.
