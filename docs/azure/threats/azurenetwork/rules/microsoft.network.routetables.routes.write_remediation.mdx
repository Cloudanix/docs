### Event Information

1. The Microsoft.Network.routeTables.routes.write event in Azure for AzureNetwork refers to the action of writing or updating routes within a route table in the Azure virtual network.

2. This event indicates that a change has been made to the routing configuration of the virtual network, such as adding, modifying, or deleting routes.

3. It is important to monitor this event as it can impact the network traffic flow within the virtual network and ensure that the routing configuration is correctly maintained for optimal network connectivity.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized modification of route tables: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Network.routeTables.routes.write permission in Azure for AzureNetwork, it could potentially allow an attacker to modify the routes within the route tables. This could lead to unauthorized traffic redirection, allowing the attacker to gain access to sensitive resources or compromise the network infrastructure.

2. Traffic interception and eavesdropping: With the ability to write routes in Azure Network, an attacker could potentially redirect network traffic to a malicious destination. This could enable them to intercept and eavesdrop on the communication between resources within the network, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the data being transmitted.

3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: By modifying the routes within the route tables, an attacker could potentially redirect traffic in a way that causes congestion or overload on specific resources or network segments. This could result in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, rendering the affected resources or network segments unavailable to legitimate users or services.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized modification of route tables:
- Identify the affected route table(s) in the AzureNetwork.
- Review the current routes and compare them with the expected routes.
- Remove any unauthorized routes or modifications made by the attacker.
- Implement network security groups (NSGs) to restrict access to the route tables.
- Regularly monitor and audit the route tables for any unauthorized changes.

2. Route table poisoning:
- Identify the affected route table(s) in the AzureNetwork.
- Review the current routes and compare them with the expected routes.
- Remove any malicious routes injected by the attacker.
- Implement network security groups (NSGs) to restrict access to the route tables.
- Regularly monitor and audit the route tables for any unauthorized changes.
- Implement route table propagation control to prevent unauthorized modifications.

3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:
- Identify the affected route table(s) in the AzureNetwork.
- Review the current routes and compare them with the expected routes.
- Remove any routes that redirect traffic to non-existent or congested destinations.
- Implement network security groups (NSGs) to restrict access to the route tables.
- Implement traffic monitoring and anomaly detection mechanisms to identify and mitigate DoS attacks.
- Regularly monitor and audit the route tables for any unauthorized changes.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized modification of route tables:
- Identify the affected route table(s) by reviewing the Azure Network Security Group (NSG) flow logs or Azure Monitor logs.
- Remove the Microsoft.Network.routeTables.routes.write permission from unauthorized users or roles using the Azure CLI command: `az role assignment delete --assignee <assignee> --role "Microsoft.Network/routeTables/routes/write" --scope <route_table_id>`

2. Route table poisoning:
- Review the route tables for any suspicious or unauthorized routes using the Azure CLI command: `az network route-table route list --resource-group <resource_group_name> --route-table-name <route_table_name>`
- Remove any malicious routes or modify existing routes to their original configuration using the Azure CLI command: `az network route-table route delete --resource-group <resource_group_name> --route-table-name <route_table_name> --name <route_name>`

3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:
- Monitor the route tables for any abnormal changes or unauthorized route modifications using Azure Monitor or Azure Security Center.
- Implement network security measures such as Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall to prevent unauthorized traffic redirection.
- Regularly review and validate the route tables to ensure they are configured correctly and do not contain any unauthorized routes.

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized modification of route tables:
- Identify and remove any unnecessary or unused permissions for Microsoft.Network.routeTables.routes.write in AzureNetwork.
- Regularly monitor and review route table configurations for any unauthorized modifications using Azure Resource Graph or Azure Monitor.
- Implement network security groups (NSGs) and virtual network service endpoints to restrict access to route tables and prevent unauthorized modifications.

2. Route table poisoning:
- Regularly review and validate the routes within route tables to ensure they are legitimate and authorized.
- Implement network security groups (NSGs) and virtual network service endpoints to restrict access to route tables and prevent unauthorized modifications.
- Enable route table logging and monitoring to detect any suspicious or malicious route changes.

3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:
- Implement network security groups (NSGs) and virtual network service endpoints to restrict access to route tables and prevent unauthorized modifications.
- Enable route table logging and monitoring to detect any suspicious or malicious route changes.
- Implement DDoS protection services such as Azure DDoS Protection Standard to mitigate and prevent DoS attacks on the AzureNetwork.
