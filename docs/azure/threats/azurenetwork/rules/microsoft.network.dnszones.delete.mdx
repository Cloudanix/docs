### Event Information

- The Microsoft.Network.dnszones.delete event in Azure for AzureNetwork indicates that a DNS zone has been deleted within the Azure Network.
- This event signifies that the DNS zone, which is used for managing the domain name resolution within the Azure Network, has been removed.
- It is important to note that deleting a DNS zone will result in the loss of all associated DNS records and configurations, so caution should be exercised before performing this action.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Network.dnszones.delete in Azure for AzureNetwork, it could mean that an unauthorized user or entity has gained access to the Azure Network and is able to delete DNS zones. This could lead to a loss of DNS resolution for the affected resources, potentially causing service disruptions or even unauthorized access to sensitive data.

2. DNS hijacking: Another security impact could be DNS hijacking, where an attacker deletes DNS zones in order to redirect traffic to malicious servers. This can result in users being directed to fake websites or having their communications intercepted, leading to potential data breaches or other malicious activities.

3. Denial of Service (DoS): Deleting DNS zones in Azure Network can also be used as a means to launch a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. By deleting critical DNS zones, an attacker can disrupt the normal functioning of the network, rendering services inaccessible to legitimate users. This can result in significant downtime, loss of revenue, and damage to the organization's reputation.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Identify the affected DNS zone: First, you need to identify the DNS zone that has been deleted or is at risk of being deleted. This can be done by reviewing the Azure Network configuration and DNS settings.

2. Restore the deleted DNS zone: If the DNS zone has been deleted, you should restore it as soon as possible to ensure DNS resolution for the affected resources. To do this, navigate to the Azure portal and go to the Azure Network resource. From there, access the DNS settings and locate the deleted DNS zone. Use the available options to restore the zone to its previous state.

3. Review and strengthen security measures: To prevent unauthorized deletion of DNS zones in the future, it is important to review and strengthen the security measures in place. This may include implementing multi-factor authentication for user accounts, regularly monitoring and reviewing access logs, and restricting permissions to only authorized individuals or entities. Additionally, consider enabling auditing and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to any suspicious activities related to DNS zone management.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unauthorized deletion of DNS zones in Azure for AzureNetwork using Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected DNS zone: Use the following command to list all the DNS zones in Azure Network:
   ```
   az network dns zone list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --output table
   ```

2. Restore the deleted DNS zone: If you have a backup of the deleted DNS zone, you can restore it using the following command:
   ```
   az network dns zone import --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <dns-zone-name> --file <backup-file-path>
   ```

3. Investigate and mitigate the security breach: It is important to investigate how the unauthorized deletion occurred and take necessary steps to prevent future incidents. This may involve reviewing access controls, enabling auditing and monitoring, and implementing additional security measures such as multi-factor authentication.

Note: It is recommended to regularly backup DNS zones and implement proper access controls to minimize the impact of unauthorized deletion.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of DNS zones in Azure for AzureNetwork, you can use the following steps:

1. Monitor and detect unauthorized access: Implement Azure Monitor to track and analyze activity logs for Azure Network. Set up alerts to notify you when any deletion activity is detected for DNS zones. This will help you identify and respond to unauthorized access promptly.

2. Implement RBAC and access controls: Ensure that proper Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is in place for Azure Network. Assign appropriate permissions to users and entities based on the principle of least privilege. Regularly review and update access controls to prevent unauthorized deletion of DNS zones.

3. Enable Azure DNS zone recovery: Enable the Azure DNS zone recovery feature, which allows you to recover deleted DNS zones within a specific retention period. This can help you restore deleted zones in case of accidental or unauthorized deletions.

Here is a sample Python script that demonstrates how to implement these steps:

```python
# Import the required libraries
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient

# Set the Azure subscription ID and resource group name
subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
resource_group_name = 'your_resource_group_name'

# Set up the Azure credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create the Network Management Client and Monitor Management Client
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Step 1: Monitor and detect unauthorized access
# Set up the alert rule for deletion activity
monitor_client.alert_rules.create_or_update(
    resource_group_name,
    'dns-zone-deletion-alert',
    {
        'location': 'global',
        'enabled': True,
        'condition': {
            'odata.type': 'Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.ManagementEventRuleCondition',
            'dataSource': {
                'odata.type': 'Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.RuleDataSource',
                'resourceUri': f'/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group_name}/providers/Microsoft.Network/dnszones',
                'query': 'eventTimestamp ge datetimeadd(\'hour\', -1, now()) and operationName eq \'Microsoft.Network/dnszones/delete\''
            }
        },
        'actions': {
            'odata.type': 'Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.RuleEmailAction',
            'sendToServiceOwners': True
        }
    }
)

# Step 2: Implement RBAC and access controls (manually)

# Step 3: Enable Azure DNS zone recovery (manually)
```

Please note that the RBAC and Azure DNS zone recovery steps need to be implemented manually as they require specific configuration and setup in the Azure portal. The provided Python script demonstrates how to set up the alert rule for monitoring unauthorized deletion activity.
