### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Network.dnszones.delete event in AzureNetwork refers to the deletion of a DNS zone in the Azure Network service.
- This event indicates that a DNS zone, which is used to manage and resolve domain names within the Azure Network, has been deleted.
- The event can be used to track changes and monitor the lifecycle of DNS zones in Azure, providing visibility into when and by whom a DNS zone was deleted.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Network.dnszones.delete in Azure for AzureNetwork, it means that an unauthorized user or process has the ability to delete DNS zones within the Azure Network. This can lead to disruption of network connectivity and potential data breaches.

- Remediation Steps:
1. Sign in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) using your Azure account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Azure Network resource that is impacted by the security issue.
3. Click on the "Networking" tab in the left-hand menu.
4. Select "DNS zones" from the sub-menu.
5. Identify the DNS zone that needs to be protected and click on it.
6. In the DNS zone overview page, click on the "Access control (IAM)" tab.
7. Click on the "+ Add" button to add a new role assignment.
8. In the "Add role assignment" panel, select the appropriate role (e.g., "Contributor" or "DNS Zone Contributor") from the "Role" dropdown menu.
9. In the "Assign access to" field, search for and select the user or group that should have the ability to manage DNS zones.
10. Click on the "Save" button to apply the role assignment.
11. Repeat steps 7-10 for any additional users or groups that require access to the DNS zone.
12. Review the existing role assignments to ensure that only authorized users or groups have access to the DNS zone.
13. Regularly monitor the access control settings for the Azure Network resource to detect any unauthorized changes or access.

Note: It is recommended to follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles and permissions to ensure that only necessary access is granted to users or groups.

#### Using CLI

1. Example of security impact: When the Microsoft.Network.dnszones.delete operation is performed on an Azure Network, it can potentially lead to the deletion of DNS zones associated with the network. This can result in the loss of DNS records and disrupt the resolution of domain names for resources within the network.

2. Remediation using AZU CLI: To remediate this security impact and prevent accidental deletion of DNS zones, you can implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and restrict the permissions for the Microsoft.Network/dnszones/delete operation. Here are the CLI commands to achieve this:

   - First, create a custom role definition with limited permissions:
     ```
     az role definition create --name "Limited DNS Zone Deletion" --actions "Microsoft.Network/dnszones/delete" --not-actions "*" --assignable-scopes "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}"
     ```

   - Next, assign the custom role to the appropriate user, group, or service principal:
     ```
     az role assignment create --assignee {principalId} --role "Limited DNS Zone Deletion" --scope "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{virtualNetworkName}"
     ```

   Replace `{subscriptionId}`, `{resourceGroupName}`, `{virtualNetworkName}`, and `{principalId}` with the actual values specific to your Azure environment.

3. Ongoing management: Regularly review and audit the RBAC assignments and permissions to ensure that only authorized individuals or entities have the necessary access to perform DNS zone deletions. Additionally, consider implementing Azure Resource Locks to provide an extra layer of protection against accidental deletions.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with Microsoft.Network.dnszones.delete in Azure for Azure Network:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the Azure Network and performs the Microsoft.Network.dnszones.delete operation, they can delete DNS zones associated with the network. This can lead to disruption of DNS resolution for resources within the network, potentially causing service outages or unauthorized access to resources.

2. Remediation for Azure Network using Python:
   - To remediate this security issue in Azure Network using Python, you can leverage the Azure SDK for Python (azure-mgmt-dns) to implement the necessary controls. Here's an example script:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.dns import DnsManagementClient

# Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Specify your Azure subscription ID and resource group name
subscription_id = '<your-subscription-id>'
resource_group_name = '<your-resource-group-name>'

# Specify the DNS zone name and Azure Network name
dns_zone_name = '<your-dns-zone-name>'
azure_network_name = '<your-azure-network-name>'

# Create the DNS management client
dns_client = DnsManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Get the DNS zone resource ID
dns_zone = dns_client.zones.get(resource_group_name, dns_zone_name)
dns_zone_id = dns_zone.id

# Get the Azure Network resource ID
azure_network = dns_client.virtual_network_links.get(resource_group_name, azure_network_name)
azure_network_id = azure_network.id

# Remove the DNS zone from the Azure Network
dns_client.virtual_network_links.delete(resource_group_name, azure_network_name, dns_zone_id)
```

This script authenticates using the DefaultAzureCredential, retrieves the DNS zone and Azure Network resource IDs, and then removes the DNS zone from the Azure Network using the `virtual_network_links.delete` method.

Note: Make sure to replace the placeholders (`<your-subscription-id>`, `<your-resource-group-name>`, `<your-dns-zone-name>`, `<your-azure-network-name>`) with the actual values specific to your environment.
