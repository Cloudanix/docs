### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Network.virtualNetworks.delete event in AzureNetwork refers to the deletion of a virtual network in the Azure network infrastructure.
- This event indicates that a virtual network resource has been permanently removed from the Azure environment.
- It is important to note that deleting a virtual network will also delete all associated subnets, network security groups, and any other resources within the virtual network.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Azure Network resource and performs a Microsoft.Network.virtualNetworks.delete event, it can lead to the deletion of the virtual network. This can disrupt network connectivity and potentially expose sensitive data or services hosted within the virtual network.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have permissions to manage and delete virtual networks. Use Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to assign appropriate roles and permissions to users.
- Enable Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs): NSGs allow you to define inbound and outbound traffic rules to control network access to and from virtual networks. By configuring NSGs effectively, you can restrict unauthorized deletion of virtual networks.
- Enable Azure Resource Locks: Resource locks can be applied to prevent accidental deletion of critical resources. By applying a delete lock on the virtual network resource, it will require explicit removal of the lock before deletion is allowed.

Azure CLI command to apply a delete lock on a virtual network:
```
az lock create --name <lock-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --resource-name <virtual-network-name> --resource-type Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks --lock-type CanNotDelete
```

Note: Replace `<lock-name>`, `<resource-group-name>`, and `<virtual-network-name>` with appropriate values.

2. Example of security impact: If a malicious insider gains access to the Azure Network resource and executes a Microsoft.Network.virtualNetworks.delete event, they can delete the virtual network without proper authorization. This can result in a complete loss of network connectivity and potential data breaches.

Remediation:
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for all user accounts accessing the Azure Network resource. This adds an extra layer of security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access and deletion.
- Enable Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center: These services provide continuous monitoring and threat detection capabilities. By configuring alerts and notifications, you can proactively identify any suspicious activities related to virtual network deletion and take appropriate actions.
- Regularly review audit logs: Monitor and analyze the Azure Activity Logs and Azure Monitor logs to identify any unauthorized or suspicious activities related to virtual network deletion. This can help in detecting and mitigating security incidents in a timely manner.

Azure CLI command to enable Azure Monitor for a virtual network:
```
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name <diagnostic-settings-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --resource <virtual-network-id> --logs '[{"category": "NetworkSecurityGroupEvent", "enabled": true}]'
```

Note: Replace `<diagnostic-settings-name>`, `<resource-group-name>`, and `<virtual-network-id>` with appropriate values.

3. Example of security impact: If a misconfigured automation script or infrastructure-as-code (IaC) template is executed, it may inadvertently trigger a Microsoft.Network.virtualNetworks.delete event on the Azure Network resource. This can lead to the accidental deletion of the virtual network and disruption of network connectivity.

Remediation:
- Implement proper testing and validation processes: Before executing any automation scripts or IaC templates, thoroughly test them in non-production environments. Validate the scripts against a test environment to ensure they do not have unintended consequences, such as deleting critical resources.
- Implement change management practices: Establish a change management process that includes proper review and approval mechanisms for any changes to the Azure Network resource. This helps in preventing unauthorized or accidental deletions.
- Regularly backup virtual network configurations: Take regular backups of the virtual network configurations, including subnets, security groups, and routing settings. This allows for quick restoration in case of accidental deletion, minimizing the impact on network operations.

Azure CLI command to backup virtual network configurations:
```
az network vnet show --name <virtual-network-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --query "{subnets:subnets, securityGroups:securityGroups, routingTables:routingTables}" --output json > backup.json
```

Note: Replace `<virtual-network-name>` and `<resource-group-name>` with appropriate values.
