- Regularly monitor and review access logs and audit trails to detect any unauthorized access attempts and take appropriate actions.

Azure CLI commands:
```
# Get the Application Gateway resource
az network application-gateway show --name <gateway_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name>

# Update the "stop" action configuration
az network application-gateway update --name <gateway_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --set stopConfiguration.property=value

# Enable multi-factor authentication for users
az ad user update --id <user_id> --add otherMails <email_address>
```

2. To remediate service disruption caused by an unintentional or unplanned stop action on an Azure Network Application Gateway, you can follow these steps:

- Identify the cause of the unintended stop action, such as a misconfiguration or human error.
- Restore the Application Gateway to its previous state by starting it again using the appropriate Azure CLI command.
- Implement safeguards and approval processes to prevent accidental stop actions, such as requiring multiple levels of authorization or using automation scripts with proper validation checks.

Azure CLI commands:
```
# Start the Application Gateway
az network application-gateway start --name <gateway_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name>
```

3. To remediate compliance violations resulting from unauthorized access or service disruption on an Azure Network Application Gateway, you can take the following actions:

- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the extent of the compliance violation and the potential impact on sensitive data or regulated processes.
- Implement necessary controls and security measures to prevent future unauthorized access or service disruptions.
- Report the incident to the appropriate regulatory bodies, if required, and take necessary steps to rectify the non-compliance.
- Regularly review and update the compliance policies and procedures to ensure they align with the applicable regulations and standards.

Note: Compliance remediation may involve additional steps specific to the compliance standards applicable to your organization.

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized access: To remediate unauthorized access to an Azure Network Application Gateway, you can implement the following steps using Python scripts:

- Regularly review and update the Network Application Gateway's access control rules to ensure only authorized traffic is allowed.
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), for accessing the Application Gateway's management interface.
- Monitor and analyze logs and alerts from the Application Gateway to detect any suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.
- Utilize Azure Active Directory (AAD) integration to enforce role-based access control (RBAC) and limit access to the Application Gateway's management resources.
- Implement network security groups (NSGs) to restrict inbound and outbound traffic to the Application Gateway.

Here's an example Python script to update the access control rules of an Azure Network Application Gateway:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Specify the resource group and Application Gateway name
resource_group_name = "your_resource_group_name"
application_gateway_name = "your_application_gateway_name"

# Retrieve the Application Gateway
application_gateway = network_client.application_gateways.get(resource_group_name, application_gateway_name)

# Update the access control rules
application_gateway.web_application_firewall_configuration.request_header_access_conditions = "Allow"
application_gateway.web_application_firewall_configuration.request_body_access_conditions = "Allow"

# Apply the changes
network_client.application_gateways.create_or_update(resource_group_name, application_gateway_name, application_gateway)
```

2. Service disruption: To remediate service disruption caused by an unintentional or unplanned stop action on an Azure Network Application Gateway, you can use the following Python script:

- Implement proper monitoring and alerting mechanisms to quickly identify any unexpected stop actions on the Application Gateway.
