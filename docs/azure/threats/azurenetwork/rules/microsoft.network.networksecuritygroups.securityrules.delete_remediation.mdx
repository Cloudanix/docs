### Event Information

1. The Microsoft.Network.networkSecurityGroups.securityRules.delete event in Azure for AzureNetwork indicates that a security rule within a network security group (NSG) has been deleted.
2. This event signifies a change in the network security configuration, specifically the removal of a security rule that was previously defined within the NSG.
3. It is important to review the details of this event to understand which security rule was deleted and the potential impact on network traffic and security policies within the AzureNetwork.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of security rules: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Network.networkSecurityGroups.securityRules.delete in Azure for AzureNetwork, it could potentially lead to unauthorized deletion of security rules. This can result in the removal of essential network security controls, leaving the network vulnerable to unauthorized access or malicious activities.

2. Inconsistent security policies: Deleting security rules without proper planning and documentation can lead to inconsistent security policies within the AzureNetwork. This can create confusion and make it difficult to manage and enforce security controls across the network. It is important to have a well-defined process and governance in place to ensure that security rules are only deleted when necessary and in accordance with the organization's security policies.

3. Compliance violations: Deleting security rules without proper authorization or documentation can also lead to compliance violations. Many compliance standards require organizations to have strict control over network security configurations and changes. Unauthorized deletion of security rules can result in non-compliance with these standards, potentially leading to penalties or loss of certifications. It is crucial to follow proper change management processes and maintain an audit trail of all security rule deletions to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion of security rules in Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs), follow these steps:

1. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assign appropriate RBAC roles to users and groups to ensure that only authorized individuals have the permissions to modify security rules. This will help prevent unauthorized deletions.

2. Enable NSG Flow Logs: Enable NSG Flow Logs to capture all network traffic and changes to security rules. This will provide visibility into any unauthorized deletions and help in identifying the responsible party.

3. Regularly review and audit security rule changes: Set up a process to regularly review and audit security rule changes in NSGs. This can be done by analyzing NSG Flow Logs or using Azure Monitor. Any unauthorized deletions can be identified and addressed promptly.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of security rules in Azure Network Security Groups and ensure the security of your resources.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate unauthorized deletion of security rules in Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs), you can use the Azure CLI commands to restore the deleted rules or revert to a previous known good configuration. 

- First, identify the NSG where the security rules were deleted using the following command:
  `az network nsg list`

- Once you have identified the NSG, you can retrieve the deleted security rules from the NSG's activity log using the following command:
  `az monitor activity-log list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --resource <nsg-name> --filter "eventTimestamp ge <start-time> and eventTimestamp le <end-time> and operationName eq 'Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/delete'"`
  Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group containing the NSG, `<nsg-name>` with the name of the NSG, `<start-time>` with the start time of the activity log search, and `<end-time>` with the end time of the activity log search.

- Once you have identified the deleted security rules, you can recreate them using the following command:
  `az network nsg rule create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --nsg-name <nsg-name> --name <rule-name> --priority <priority> --source-address-prefix <source-address-prefix> --destination-address-prefix <destination-address-prefix> --access <access> --protocol <protocol> --direction <direction> --destination-port-range <destination-port-range>`
  Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values for the new security rule.

2. To remediate network misconfigurations caused by deleting security rules in Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs), you can use the Azure CLI commands to restore the deleted rules or modify existing rules to restore connectivity.

- First, identify the NSG where the security rules were deleted or modified using the following command:
  `az network nsg list`

- Once you have identified the NSG, you can retrieve the current security rules using the following command:
  `az network nsg show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <nsg-name>`

- Review the output to identify any misconfigurations or missing rules. You can then recreate the deleted rules or modify existing rules using the following command:
  `az network nsg rule create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --nsg-name <nsg-name> --name <rule-name> --priority <priority> --source-address-prefix <source-address-prefix> --destination-address-prefix <destination-address-prefix> --access <access> --protocol <protocol> --direction <direction> --destination-port-range <destination-port-range>`
  Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values for the new or modified security rule.

3. To remediate compliance violations caused by deleting security rules in Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs), you should follow the compliance requirements and implement the necessary security controls.

- Review the compliance requirements and identify the specific security rules that are required to be in place.

- Use the Azure CLI commands to recreate the deleted security rules or modify existing rules to ensure compliance with the requirements. Refer to the previous steps mentioned for recreating or modifying security rules.

- Regularly review and audit security rule changes in the NSGs to ensure ongoing compliance. Use the Azure CLI commands to retrieve the NSG activity log and monitor for any unauthorized or non-compliant changes.

Remember to always follow proper change management processes, implement least privilege access controls, and regularly review and audit security rule changes to mitigate the impact on security when deleting security rules in Azure Network Security Groups.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of security rules in Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs), you can use the following Python script:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Specify your Azure subscription ID
subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'

# Specify the resource group and NSG name
resource_group_name = 'your_resource_group_name'
nsg_name = 'your_nsg_name'

# Create the Network Management client
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Get the NSG
nsg = network_client.network_security_groups.get(resource_group_name, nsg_name)

# Restore the deleted security rules
for rule in nsg.security_rules:
    if rule.provisioning_state == 'Deleted':
        network_client.security_rules.begin_create_or_update(resource_group_name, nsg_name, rule.name, rule)
```

To remediate network misconfigurations caused by deleting security rules, you can use the same script mentioned above to restore the deleted security rules.

To remediate compliance violations, you should ensure that the deleted security rules are in line with your compliance requirements. You can modify the script to check for compliance before restoring the deleted security rules. This may involve additional logic specific to your compliance requirements.

Remember to replace the placeholders (`your_subscription_id`, `your_resource_group_name`, `your_nsg_name`) with the actual values specific to your Azure environment.
