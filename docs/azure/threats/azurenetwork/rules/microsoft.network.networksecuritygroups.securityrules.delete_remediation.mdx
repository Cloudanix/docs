### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The Microsoft.Network.networkSecurityGroups.securityRules.delete event in AzureRealtime for AzureNetwork indicates that a security rule within a network security group (NSG) has been deleted.
2. This event signifies a change in the network security configuration, specifically the removal of a security rule that was previously defined within the NSG.
3. It is important to monitor this event as it can impact the network traffic flow and security policies within the AzureNetwork, and may require further investigation to ensure that the deletion was intentional and does not introduce any vulnerabilities.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.Network.networkSecurityGroups.securityRules.delete event occurs in AzureRealtime for AzureNetwork, it means that a security rule within a network security group (NSG) has been deleted. This can potentially impact the security of the AzureNetwork as the deleted rule might have been responsible for allowing or denying specific network traffic.

2. Remediation steps:
   - Identify the deleted security rule: Use the Azure CLI command `az network nsg show --name <nsg-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>` to retrieve the details of the NSG and check for the deleted rule.
   - Restore the deleted security rule: If the deleted rule was critical for the security of the AzureNetwork, you can recreate it using the Azure CLI command `az network nsg rule create --name <rule-name> --nsg-name <nsg-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --priority <priority> --protocol <protocol> --source-address-prefix <source-address-prefix> --destination-address-prefix <destination-address-prefix> --access <access> --direction <direction> --destination-port-range <destination-port-range>`.
   - Review NSG configurations: It is important to review the NSG configurations and ensure that the remaining security rules are sufficient to maintain the desired security posture. Use the Azure Portal or Azure CLI to inspect the NSG rules and make any necessary adjustments.

3. Preventive measures:
   - Implement RBAC: Ensure that only authorized users have permissions to modify NSG rules by implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and assigning appropriate roles to users.
   - Enable NSG flow logs: Enable NSG flow logs to capture all network traffic and rule modifications. This will help in auditing and detecting any unauthorized changes to NSG rules.
   - Regularly backup NSG configurations: Take regular backups of NSG configurations to have a restore point in case of accidental rule deletions. This can be done by exporting the NSG configuration using the Azure CLI command `az network nsg export --name <nsg-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --output <output-file-path>`.
