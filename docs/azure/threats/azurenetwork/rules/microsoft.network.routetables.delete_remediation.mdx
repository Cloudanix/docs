### Event Information

- The Microsoft.Network.routeTables.delete event in Azure for AzureNetwork indicates that a route table has been deleted within the specified Azure virtual network.
- This event signifies that any routes associated with the deleted route table will no longer be in effect, potentially impacting network traffic within the virtual network.
- It is important to review the reason for the deletion and assess the impact on network connectivity and routing configurations within the AzureNetwork.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Network.routeTables.delete in Azure for AzureNetwork, one example could be an unauthorized user gaining access to the Azure portal or API and deleting a route table. This could result in disruption of network connectivity or routing issues for the affected resources.

2. Misconfiguration: Another example could be a misconfiguration during the deletion process. For instance, if a route table is deleted without properly updating the associated network interfaces or subnets, it can lead to network traffic being dropped or routed incorrectly, potentially exposing resources to unauthorized access or compromising network security.

3. Lack of backup or recovery plan: If a route table is deleted without a proper backup or recovery plan in place, it can result in loss of critical network configuration information. This can lead to extended downtime, loss of connectivity, and potential security vulnerabilities until the route table is restored or reconfigured correctly.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion, misconfiguration, or lack of backup or recovery plan for AzureNetwork using the Azure console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Unauthorized deletion:
   - Enable Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication for the Azure portal and API to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict permissions and ensure only authorized users have the ability to delete route tables.
   - Regularly monitor and review audit logs to detect any unauthorized activities and take appropriate actions.

2. Misconfiguration:
   - Before deleting a route table, ensure that all associated network interfaces and subnets are properly updated or disassociated.
   - Double-check the dependencies and impact of deleting a route table to avoid any disruption in network connectivity.
   - Implement automation or configuration management tools to enforce consistent and correct configurations across your Azure environment.

3. Lack of backup or recovery plan:
   - Regularly backup your route tables using Azure Backup or other backup solutions to ensure you have a copy of critical network configuration information.
   - Document and maintain a recovery plan that includes steps to recreate or restore route tables in case of accidental deletion.
   - Test the recovery plan periodically to ensure its effectiveness and make any necessary updates based on changes in your environment.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized deletion, misconfiguration, and lack of backup or recovery plan for AzureNetwork in Azure.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion:
- Identify the unauthorized deletion by reviewing Azure activity logs or audit logs.
- Disable the user's access or revoke their permissions to prevent further unauthorized actions.
- Restore the deleted route table from a backup or recreate it using the Azure CLI command `az network route-table create`.

2. Misconfiguration:
- Identify the misconfiguration by reviewing the network interfaces and subnets associated with the deleted route table.
- Update the network interfaces or subnets to point to a valid route table using the Azure CLI command `az network nic update` or `az network vnet subnet update`.
- Verify the network connectivity and routing after the configuration changes.

3. Lack of backup or recovery plan:
- Implement a backup or recovery plan for critical network configuration information, including route tables.
- Regularly backup the route tables using Azure CLI command `az network route-table show` and store the backup in a secure location.
- In case of deletion, restore the route table from the backup using the Azure CLI command `az network route-table create`.

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized deletion:
- Implement strong access controls and authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to the Azure portal or API.
- Regularly review and monitor access logs and audit trails to detect any suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts to add an extra layer of security.

2. Misconfiguration:
- Implement proper change management processes and procedures to ensure that all changes, including route table deletions, are thoroughly reviewed and tested before being implemented.
- Use automation tools or scripts to ensure consistent and accurate configuration updates across all associated network interfaces and subnets.
- Regularly validate network configurations to identify any misconfigurations or inconsistencies and promptly address them.

3. Lack of backup or recovery plan:
- Regularly backup critical network configuration information, including route tables, using Azure Backup or other suitable backup solutions.
- Implement a disaster recovery plan that includes regular testing and validation of the backup and recovery processes.
- Document and maintain a step-by-step recovery procedure to quickly restore the deleted route table from the backup in case of an incident.
