None

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized modification of shared key:
- Identify the affected AzureNetwork and the specific shared key that has been modified.
- Access the Azure portal and navigate to the AzureNetwork resource.
- Go to the "Settings" section and select "Connections".
- Locate the connection that has the modified shared key and click on it.
- In the connection details, select the "Shared Key" tab.
- Click on the "Edit" button to modify the shared key.
- Generate a new secure shared key and replace the existing one.
- Save the changes and ensure that the new shared key is properly distributed to all the relevant virtual networks.

2. Man-in-the-middle attacks:
- Identify the affected AzureNetwork and the specific shared key that has been compromised.
- Access the Azure portal and navigate to the AzureNetwork resource.
- Go to the "Settings" section and select "Connections".
- Locate the connection that has the compromised shared key and click on it.
- In the connection details, select the "Shared Key" tab.
- Click on the "Regenerate" button to generate a new shared key.
- Save the changes and ensure that the new shared key is properly distributed to all the relevant virtual networks.
- Monitor network traffic for any suspicious activities or anomalies that could indicate a potential man-in-the-middle attack.

3. Network disruption:
- Identify the affected AzureNetwork and the specific shared key that has been modified.
- Access the Azure portal and navigate to the AzureNetwork resource.
- Go to the "Settings" section and select "Connections".
- Locate the connection that has the modified shared key and click on it.
- In the connection details, select the "Shared Key" tab.
- Click on the "Edit" button to modify the shared key.
- Generate a new secure shared key and replace the existing one.
- Save the changes and ensure that the new shared key is properly distributed to all the relevant virtual networks.
- Monitor the network connectivity and performance to ensure that there are no disruptions or denial of service issues.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate unauthorized modification of shared key in Azure for AzureNetwork, you can follow these steps using Azure CLI commands:

- Identify the affected virtual network and the shared key that has been modified.
- Reset the shared key to its original value or generate a new secure key.
- Use the Azure CLI command `az network vnet update` to update the shared key for the virtual network. For example:
  ```
  az network vnet update --name <virtual_network_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --set virtualNetworkProperties.vpnClientConfiguration.vpnClientProtocols[0].radiusServerConfigurations[0].radiusServerSecret=<new_shared_key>
  ```

2. To mitigate the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks in Azure, you can take the following steps:

- Implement secure communication protocols such as SSL/TLS to encrypt network traffic between virtual networks.
- Regularly monitor network traffic for any suspicious activities or anomalies.
- Implement network security groups (NSGs) to restrict access between virtual networks and apply strict firewall rules.

3. To address network disruption caused by modifying the shared key in Azure, you can perform the following actions:

- Restore the shared key to its original value or generate a new secure key.
- Verify the network connectivity between virtual networks and ensure that all necessary configurations are in place.
- Monitor the network for any further disruptions and investigate any potential security breaches.

#### Using Python

1. To remediate unauthorized modification of shared key in Azure for AzureNetwork, you can use the Azure Python SDK to automate the process. Here's an example script:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Specify the resource group and virtual network details
resource_group_name = "your_resource_group_name"
virtual_network_name = "your_virtual_network_name"

# Get the virtual network
virtual_network = network_client.virtual_networks.get(resource_group_name, virtual_network_name)

# Generate a new shared key
new_shared_key = "your_new_shared_key"

# Update the virtual network with the new shared key
virtual_network.vpn_client_configuration.vpn_client_protocols[0].vpn_client_protocol_parameters.shared_key = new_shared_key
network_client.virtual_networks.create_or_update(resource_group_name, virtual_network_name, virtual_network)

print("Shared key has been updated successfully.")
```

2. To mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks in Azure, you can enable Virtual Network Service Endpoints and Network Security Groups (NSGs) to restrict network traffic. Here's an example script:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Specify the resource group and virtual network details
resource_group_name = "your_resource_group_name"
virtual_network_name = "your_virtual_network_name"

# Enable service endpoints for Azure services
network_client.virtual_networks.enable_service_endpoints(resource_group_name, virtual_network_name, ["Microsoft.Storage", "Microsoft.Sql"])

# Create a network security group (NSG) and associate it with the virtual network
nsg_name = "your_nsg_name"
nsg = network_client.network_security_groups.create_or_update(resource_group_name, nsg_name, {
    "location": "your_location",
    "security_rules": []
})
network_client.virtual_networks.update(resource_group_name, virtual_network_name, {
    "network_security_group": {
        "id": nsg.id
    }
})

print("Virtual network service endpoints and network security group have been configured successfully.")
```

3. To prevent network disruption caused by modifying the shared key in Azure, you can implement Azure Network Watcher's Connection Monitor feature to continuously monitor network connectivity. Here's an example script:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.network.models import ConnectionMonitor

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Specify the resource group and virtual network details
resource_group_name = "your_resource_group_name"
virtual_network_name = "your_virtual_network_name"

# Create a connection monitor
connection_monitor_name = "your_connection_monitor_name"
connection_monitor = ConnectionMonitor(location="your_location")
network_client.connection_monitors.create_or_update(resource_group_name, connection_monitor_name, connection_monitor)

# Start the connection monitor
network_client.connection_monitors.begin_start(resource_group_name, connection_monitor_name)

print("Connection monitor has been started successfully.")
```

These scripts demonstrate how to remediate the mentioned security issues using Python and the Azure Python SDK. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual resource names and customize the scripts as per your requirements.
