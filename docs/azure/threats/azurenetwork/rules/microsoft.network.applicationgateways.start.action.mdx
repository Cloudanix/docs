### Event Information

1. The Microsoft.Network.applicationGateways.start.action event in Azure for AzureNetwork indicates that an application gateway has been started or restarted.
2. This event signifies that the application gateway, which acts as a load balancer for web traffic, has been successfully initialized and is ready to handle incoming requests.
3. It is important to monitor this event to ensure the availability and proper functioning of the application gateway in the Azure network environment.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized access: If security is impacted with the start action for an Azure Network Application Gateway, it could potentially allow unauthorized access to the application or service behind the gateway. This could lead to data breaches or unauthorized actions being performed on the application.

2. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: Starting an Azure Network Application Gateway without proper security measures in place could make it vulnerable to DoS attacks. Attackers could flood the gateway with excessive traffic, causing it to become overwhelmed and unavailable for legitimate users.

3. Misconfiguration: If security is impacted during the start action for an Azure Network Application Gateway, it could be due to misconfiguration of security settings. This could result in the gateway being exposed to potential vulnerabilities, such as weak access controls or insecure communication protocols. It is important to ensure that proper security configurations are in place before starting the gateway to mitigate these risks.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized access, network traffic interception, and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks for an Azure Network Application Gateway, you can follow these steps using the Azure console:

1. Unauthorized access:
   - Review and update the Network Security Group (NSG) rules associated with the Azure Network Application Gateway.
   - Ensure that only necessary ports and protocols are open and accessible.
   - Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as Azure Active Directory integration or multi-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized access.

2. Network traffic interception:
   - Enable SSL/TLS encryption for the Azure Network Application Gateway to secure the network traffic passing through it.
   - Regularly update and patch the gateway to protect against known vulnerabilities.
   - Implement network monitoring and intrusion detection systems to detect any suspicious activity or traffic manipulation.

3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:
   - Configure and enable Azure DDoS Protection Standard for the Azure Network Application Gateway.
   - Set up rate limiting and request filtering to mitigate excessive traffic and potential DoS attacks.
   - Implement traffic analytics and anomaly detection to identify and block malicious traffic patterns.

It is important to regularly monitor and review the security configurations of the Azure Network Application Gateway to ensure ongoing protection against unauthorized access, network traffic interception, and DoS attacks.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized access:
- Identify and review the Network Application Gateway configuration to ensure proper access controls are in place.
- Regularly monitor and analyze logs for any suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized access.

2. Network traffic interception:
- Enable encryption protocols, such as SSL/TLS, to secure the network traffic passing through the Network Application Gateway.
- Regularly update and patch the Network Application Gateway to protect against known vulnerabilities.
- Implement network monitoring and intrusion detection systems to detect and respond to any network traffic interception attempts.

3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:
- Implement rate limiting and traffic throttling mechanisms to prevent excessive traffic from overwhelming the Network Application Gateway.
- Utilize Azure DDoS Protection Standard to mitigate and protect against DDoS attacks.
- Regularly monitor and analyze network traffic patterns to identify any potential DoS attacks and take appropriate actions to mitigate them.

CLI commands for Azure Network Application Gateway:
- To review the configuration: `az network application-gateway show --name <gateway-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>`
- To enable SSL/TLS encryption: `az network application-gateway ssl-policy set --gateway-name <gateway-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --policy-type Predefined --policy-name AppGwSslPolicy20170401S`
- To update the gateway: `az network application-gateway update --name <gateway-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>`
- To enable DDoS Protection Standard: `az network application-gateway ddos-protection enable --name <gateway-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>`
