### Event Information

- The Microsoft.Compute.images.write event in Azure for AzureVirtualMachines refers to the action of creating or updating a custom image in Azure.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process initiates the creation or modification of a custom image for virtual machines in Azure.
- It indicates that changes are being made to an existing image or a new image is being created, which can be used to provision new virtual machines with the desired configuration and software setup.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized access to virtual machine images: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Compute.images.write permission, it could potentially allow unauthorized users to create or modify virtual machine images. This can lead to the introduction of malicious code or unauthorized modifications to the images, compromising the security of the virtual machines deployed from those images.

2. Data leakage or exposure: With Microsoft.Compute.images.write permission, an attacker could potentially create or modify virtual machine images to include sensitive data or expose confidential information. This can result in data leakage or unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within the virtual machines.

3. Escalation of privileges: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Compute.images.write permission, an attacker could potentially exploit this permission to escalate their privileges within the Azure environment. By creating or modifying virtual machine images, they may be able to gain unauthorized access to other resources or perform actions that are beyond their intended level of access, leading to further security breaches.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized access to image creation, image tampering, and image proliferation in Azure Virtual Machines using the Azure console, you can follow these steps:

1. Limit access to image creation:
   - Navigate to the Azure portal and go to the Azure Active Directory (AAD) section.
   - Select "App registrations" and then click on "New registration" to create a new application registration.
   - Provide a name for the registration and select the appropriate account type.
   - Under "Redirect URI", choose the appropriate option based on your requirements.
   - Once the registration is created, go to the "API permissions" tab and click on "Add a permission".
   - Select the appropriate API (Microsoft.Compute.images) and the required permission (Microsoft.Compute/images/write).
   - Save the changes and grant admin consent for the permissions.

2. Implement image integrity checks:
   - Use Azure Security Center to enable vulnerability assessments for your virtual machines.
   - Enable the "Just-in-Time VM access" feature to restrict access to virtual machines and prevent unauthorized modifications.
   - Regularly scan and monitor your virtual machine images for any unauthorized changes or tampering.

3. Implement image lifecycle management:
   - Use Azure Policy to enforce policies that control the creation and deletion of virtual machine images.
   - Implement a tagging strategy to categorize and track images, making it easier to manage and identify any unauthorized or outdated images.
   - Regularly review and clean up unused or outdated images to reduce the risk of image sprawl.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access, image tampering, and image proliferation in Azure Virtual Machines.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate unauthorized access to image creation in Azure Virtual Machines, you can follow these steps using Azure CLI:

- Identify and remove unnecessary or unauthorized permissions for the Microsoft.Compute.images.write role assignment. Use the following command to list all role assignments for the specific resource group:
  ```
  az role assignment list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --query "[?roleDefinitionName=='Microsoft.Compute.images.write']"
  ```
  Once identified, use the following command to remove the role assignment:
  ```
  az role assignment delete --ids <role-assignment-id>
  ```

- Implement Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to create or modify images. Assign the Microsoft.Compute.images.write role only to trusted users or groups.

- Regularly monitor and audit the role assignments and permissions to detect any unauthorized changes. Use Azure Monitor or Azure Security Center to set up alerts and notifications for any suspicious activities related to image creation.

2. To remediate image tampering in Azure Virtual Machines, you can take the following actions:

- Implement Azure Disk Encryption to encrypt the virtual machine's OS and data disks. This will protect the integrity of the image contents and prevent unauthorized modifications.

- Enable Azure Security Center's Just-In-Time (JIT) VM Access feature. JIT VM Access allows you to restrict the inbound traffic to virtual machines, reducing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized access to the VMs for tampering.

- Regularly scan the virtual machine images for vulnerabilities and apply necessary security patches and updates. Use Azure Security Center's vulnerability assessment feature or third-party vulnerability scanning tools to identify and remediate any vulnerabilities in the images.

3. To remediate image proliferation in Azure Virtual Machines, you can follow these steps:

- Implement a centralized image management strategy using Azure Shared Image Gallery. This allows you to create and manage a centralized repository of images, ensuring that only authorized and up-to-date images are used for virtual machine deployments.

- Regularly review and clean up unused or outdated images. Use Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to list and delete unnecessary images. For example, you can use the following command to list all images in a specific resource group:
  ```
  az image list --resource-group <resource-group-name>
  ```
  Once identified, use the following command to delete the image:
  ```
  az image delete --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <image-name>
  ```

- Implement image versioning and tagging to track and manage different versions of images. This helps in maintaining a clear and organized image repository, reducing the risk of using outdated or vulnerable images.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized access to image creation, image tampering, and image proliferation in Azure Virtual Machines, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. Unauthorized access to image creation:
   - Use Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict the permissions for the Microsoft.Compute.images.write role to only authorized users or groups.
   - Programmatically manage RBAC using the Azure SDK for Python (azure-mgmt-authorization) to assign appropriate roles and permissions to users or groups.

2. Image tampering:
   - Implement Azure Disk Encryption to encrypt the virtual machine's OS and data disks. This will protect the image contents from unauthorized modifications.
   - Utilize Azure Security Center to enable vulnerability assessments and threat detection, which can help identify any malicious code or backdoors injected into the images.
   - Regularly update and patch the virtual machine images to ensure they are running the latest secure versions.

3. Image proliferation:
   - Implement a governance strategy to control and monitor image creation. This can include setting up approval workflows or automation processes to ensure that only authorized users can create new images.
   - Utilize Azure Policy to enforce policies that limit the number of images that can be created, preventing image sprawl.
   - Regularly review and clean up unused or outdated images to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities.

Please note that the provided steps are high-level guidelines, and you may need to adapt them based on your specific requirements and environment.
