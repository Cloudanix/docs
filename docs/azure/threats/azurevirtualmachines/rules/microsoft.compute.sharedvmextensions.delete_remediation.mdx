### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Compute.sharedVMExtensions.delete event in AzureRealTime for AzureVirtualMachines refers to the deletion of a shared virtual machine extension on an Azure virtual machine.
- This event indicates that a shared VM extension, which is a type of extension that can be used across multiple virtual machines, has been removed from the virtual machine.
- The event provides information about the specific virtual machine and the extension that was deleted, allowing administrators to track changes and monitor the lifecycle of shared VM extensions in their Azure environment.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Azure portal or API credentials and triggers the Microsoft.Compute.sharedVMExtensions.delete event for Azure Virtual Machines, they can potentially delete or modify shared VM extensions on the virtual machines. This can lead to unauthorized access, data loss, or disruption of services running on the affected virtual machines.

Remediation:
- Enable Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to manage shared VM extensions.
- Regularly review and audit the access control settings for Azure resources, including virtual machines, to identify and revoke any unnecessary or excessive permissions.
- Implement Azure Monitor alerts to notify administrators when any critical changes, such as deletion or modification of shared VM extensions, occur. This can help in detecting and responding to unauthorized activities promptly.

Azure CLI command to enable RBAC for a virtual machine:
```
az role assignment create --assignee <user or group principal ID> --role "Virtual Machine Contributor" --scope /subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<virtual machine name>
```

2. Example of security impact: If a malicious actor gains access to the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template or deployment scripts used for provisioning Azure Virtual Machines and modifies the code to include the Microsoft.Compute.sharedVMExtensions.delete event, they can automatically delete shared VM extensions during the deployment process. This can result in the removal of critical security or management extensions, leaving the virtual machines vulnerable or impacting their functionality.

Remediation:
- Implement version control and access control mechanisms for ARM templates and deployment scripts to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- Regularly review and validate the code of ARM templates and deployment scripts to ensure that they do not include any unauthorized or potentially harmful actions.
- Enable Azure Resource Manager template validation during the deployment process to detect any potential issues or unauthorized actions before the deployment proceeds.

Azure CLI command to validate an ARM template:
```
az deployment group validate --resource-group <resource group name> --template-file <path to ARM template file>
```

3. Example of security impact: If a misconfigured Azure Logic App or Azure Function triggers the Microsoft.Compute.sharedVMExtensions.delete event without proper authentication or authorization checks, it can lead to the unintended deletion of shared VM extensions on Azure Virtual Machines. This can result in the disruption of services or unauthorized access to the virtual machines.

Remediation:
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms within Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions to ensure that only authorized users or processes can trigger actions related to shared VM extensions.
- Regularly review and test the logic and workflows of Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions to identify any potential misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.
- Enable Azure Monitor diagnostic logs for Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions to capture and analyze the activities related to shared VM extensions, allowing for proactive detection and response to any unauthorized or unintended actions.

Azure CLI command to enable diagnostic logs for an Azure Logic App:
```
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name <diagnostic settings name> --resource <logic app resource ID> --logs '[{"category": "WorkflowRuntime"}]'
```
