### Event Information

- The Microsoft.Compute.images.delete event in Azure for AzureVirtualMachines refers to the deletion of a custom image that was previously created in Azure.
- This event indicates that a custom image, which is a snapshot of a virtual machine, has been removed from the Azure environment.
- Deleting custom images helps to manage and clean up unused or outdated images, freeing up storage space and ensuring that only necessary images are retained.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of images: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Compute.images.delete in Azure for AzureVirtualMachines, it could potentially lead to unauthorized deletion of images. This means that an attacker could delete critical images that are used to provision virtual machines, resulting in service disruption or loss of important data.

2. Image tampering: Another security impact could be image tampering. If an unauthorized user gains access to the Microsoft.Compute.images.delete operation, they could potentially modify or tamper with the images used for virtual machine provisioning. This could result in compromised instances being deployed, leading to potential data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: The Microsoft.Compute.images.delete operation could also be exploited to launch Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. By repeatedly deleting images used for virtual machine provisioning, an attacker could disrupt the availability of the virtual machines, impacting the overall performance and availability of the Azure environment.

To mitigate these security impacts, it is important to implement proper access controls, such as role-based access control (RBAC), to restrict the permissions for the Microsoft.Compute.images.delete operation. Regular monitoring and auditing of image deletion activities should also be implemented to detect any unauthorized or suspicious activities. Additionally, backups and versioning of critical images should be maintained to ensure quick recovery in case of accidental or malicious deletion.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion of images, image tampering, and potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in Azure for AzureVirtualMachines, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): 
   - Identify and assign appropriate RBAC roles to users and groups based on their responsibilities and access requirements.
   - Ensure that the Microsoft.Compute.images.delete permission is only granted to authorized personnel who require it for their specific tasks.
   - Regularly review and update RBAC assignments to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.

2. Enable Azure Resource Locks:
   - Utilize Azure Resource Locks to prevent accidental or unauthorized deletion of critical resources, such as images used for AzureVirtualMachines.
   - Apply the appropriate lock level (CanNotDelete or ReadOnly) to the images or resource groups containing the images to prevent deletion or modification by unauthorized users.

3. Enable Azure Monitor and Alerts:
   - Configure Azure Monitor to track and monitor activities related to image deletion and modification.
   - Set up alerts to notify administrators or security teams when any suspicious or unauthorized activities are detected, such as multiple image deletions within a short period or modifications to critical images.

By implementing RBAC, utilizing Azure Resource Locks, and enabling Azure Monitor and Alerts, you can mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized deletion of images, image tampering, and potential DoS attacks in Azure for AzureVirtualMachines.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unauthorized deletion of images, you can take the following steps in Azure for AzureVirtualMachines:

1. Limit access to the Microsoft.Compute.images.delete permission: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have this permission. Use Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to assign the permission to specific users or groups. Restricting access helps prevent unauthorized deletion of images.

2. Enable Azure Resource Locks: Apply a resource lock to critical images to prevent accidental or unauthorized deletion. Resource locks can be set at the resource group or individual resource level. This adds an extra layer of protection to prevent deletion.

3. Enable Azure Monitor and Alerts: Set up Azure Monitor to track and monitor activities related to image deletion. Create alerts to notify administrators when any suspicious or unauthorized deletion attempts occur. This allows for timely detection and response to potential security incidents.

CLI commands to implement these measures:

1. To assign the Microsoft.Compute.images.delete permission to a user or group:
   ```
   az role assignment create --assignee <user or group ID> --role "Virtual Machine Image Contributor" --scope <resource or resource group ID>
   ```

2. To apply a resource lock to a specific image:
   ```
   az lock create --name <lock name> --lock-type CanNotDelete --resource <image resource ID>
   ```

3. To set up an Azure Monitor alert for image deletion:
   ```
   az monitor metrics alert create --name <alert name> --resource <image resource ID> --condition "category=Administrative and operationName=Microsoft.Compute/images/delete" --action <action group ID>
   ```

Note: Replace the placeholders (<user or group ID>, <resource or resource group ID>, <image resource ID>, <lock name>, <alert name>, <action group ID>) with the appropriate values specific to your environment.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of images, you can implement the following steps in Python for AzureVirtualMachines in Azure:

1. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Ensure that proper RBAC roles and permissions are assigned to users and service principals. Limit the Microsoft.Compute.images.delete permission only to authorized individuals or groups. You can use the Azure SDK for Python to manage RBAC roles programmatically.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.authorization import AuthorizationManagementClient

# Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
authorization_client = AuthorizationManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Assign a role to a user or service principal
authorization_client.role_assignments.create(
    scope="/subscriptions/{subscription_id}",
    role_definition_id="/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/{role_definition_id}",
    principal_id="/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/providers/Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory/servicePrincipals/{principal_id}"
)
```

2. Enable Azure Resource Locks: Apply resource locks to critical images to prevent accidental or unauthorized deletion. Resource locks can be set at the subscription, resource group, or individual resource level. You can use the Azure SDK for Python to manage resource locks programmatically.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient

# Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Apply a resource lock to an image
resource_client.management_locks.create_or_update_at_resource_level(
    resource_group_name="my-resource-group",
    resource_name="my-image",
    lock_name="delete-lock",
    parameters={
        "level": "CanNotDelete",
        "notes": "Prevent unauthorized deletion"
    }
)
```

3. Enable Azure Monitor and Alerts: Set up Azure Monitor to track and alert on any deletion activities related to images. Configure alerts to notify administrators when image deletions occur, allowing for immediate investigation and response. You can use the Azure SDK for Python to manage Azure Monitor and alerts programmatically.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient

# Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Create an alert rule for image deletions
monitor_client.alert_rules.create_or_update(
    resource_group_name="my-resource-group",
    rule_name="image-deletion-alert",
    parameters={
        "location": "global",
        "description": "Alert on image deletions",
        "condition": {
            "odata.type": "Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.ThresholdRuleCondition",
            "dataSource": {
                "odata.type": "Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.RuleMetricDataSource",
                "resourceUri": "/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group_name}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/{image_name}",
                "metricName": "DeleteCount",
                "operator": "GreaterThan",
                "threshold": 0
            }
        },
        "actions": {
            "odata.type": "Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.RuleEmailAction",
