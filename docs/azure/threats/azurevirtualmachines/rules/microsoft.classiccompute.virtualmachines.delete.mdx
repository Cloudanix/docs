### Event Information

1. The Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.delete event in Azure signifies the deletion of a virtual machine (VM) in the Classic deployment model.
2. This event indicates that a specific VM, identified by its resource ID, has been permanently removed from the Azure environment.
3. It is important to note that this event is specific to the Classic deployment model and does not apply to VMs created using the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) model.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of virtual machines: If security is impacted with Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.delete, it could potentially allow unauthorized individuals to delete virtual machines within the Azure environment. This could result in the loss of critical data and disruption of services.

2. Data breaches: If security is impacted, it could lead to data breaches if an attacker gains access to the Azure environment and deletes virtual machines. This could expose sensitive information stored within the virtual machines, such as customer data or intellectual property.

3. Service disruption: Deleting virtual machines can cause service disruption, impacting the availability and performance of applications and services running on those machines. This can result in downtime for businesses and potential financial losses.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issues for Azure Virtual Machines using the Azure console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Enable Azure Security Center:
   - Go to the Azure portal and search for "Security Center" in the search bar.
   - Select "Security Center" from the results and click on it.
   - In the Security Center dashboard, click on "Pricing & settings" in the left-hand menu.
   - Choose the subscription and resource group where your Azure Virtual Machines are located.
   - Click on "Apply to all resources" to enable Security Center for all resources in the selected subscription and resource group.
   - Review the pricing tier options and select the appropriate tier for your needs.
   - Click on "Save" to enable Security Center.

2. Implement Network Security Groups (NSGs):
   - Go to the Azure portal and search for "Virtual Machines" in the search bar.
   - Select "Virtual Machines" from the results and click on it.
   - Choose the virtual machine that you want to secure with NSGs.
   - In the virtual machine's overview page, click on "Networking" in the left-hand menu.
   - Under "Inbound port rules" and "Outbound port rules", click on "Add inbound port rule" and "Add outbound port rule" respectively.
   - Configure the necessary rules to allow only the required inbound and outbound traffic.
   - Click on "Save" to apply the NSG rules to the virtual machine.

3. Implement Azure Backup:
   - Go to the Azure portal and search for "Recovery Services vaults" in the search bar.
   - Select "Recovery Services vaults" from the results and click on it.
   - Click on "Add" to create a new Recovery Services vault.
   - Provide the necessary details like subscription, resource group, and vault name.
   - Choose the appropriate region for the vault.
   - Click on "Review + create" and then "Create" to create the vault.
   - Once the vault is created, go to the virtual machine that you want to backup.
   - In the virtual machine's overview page, click on "Backup" in the left-hand menu.
   - Follow the instructions to configure the backup settings for the virtual machine.
   - Click on "Enable backup" to start the backup process.

These steps will help you remediate the issues for Azure Virtual Machines using the Azure console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issues for Azure Virtual Machines using Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Enable Azure Security Center for Azure Virtual Machines:
   - Use the Azure CLI command `az vm update --name <vm_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --set "properties.securityProfile.securityCenterEnabled=true"` to enable Azure Security Center for a specific virtual machine.

2. Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) for Azure Virtual Machines:
   - Use the Azure CLI command `az network nsg rule create --name <rule_name> --nsg-name <nsg_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --priority <priority_number> --source-address-prefixes <source_address_prefix> --destination-port-ranges <destination_port_range> --access <access_type> --protocol <protocol>` to create a new NSG rule for a specific NSG and virtual machine.

3. Implement Azure Backup for Azure Virtual Machines:
   - Use the Azure CLI command `az backup protection enable-for-vm --vm <vm_name> --vault-name <vault_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --policy-name <policy_name>` to enable Azure Backup protection for a specific virtual machine. Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values for your environment.

Please note that the actual commands may vary depending on your specific requirements and configurations. Make sure to replace the placeholders with the actual values relevant to your Azure environment.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issues for Azure Virtual Machines using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are three examples of how you can remediate common issues:

1. Example 1: Start a stopped virtual machine:
```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create a ComputeManagementClient
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Specify the resource group and virtual machine name
resource_group_name = "your_resource_group_name"
vm_name = "your_vm_name"

# Start the virtual machine
compute_client.virtual_machines.start(resource_group_name, vm_name)
```

2. Example 2: Resize a virtual machine:
```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create a ComputeManagementClient
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Specify the resource group and virtual machine name
resource_group_name = "your_resource_group_name"
vm_name = "your_vm_name"

# Specify the new size for the virtual machine
new_vm_size = "Standard_DS2_v2"

# Resize the virtual machine
compute_client.virtual_machines.begin_update(resource_group_name, vm_name, {"hardware_profile": {"vm_size": new_vm_size}})
```

3. Example 3: Restart a virtual machine:
```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create a ComputeManagementClient
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Specify the resource group and virtual machine name
resource_group_name = "your_resource_group_name"
vm_name = "your_vm_name"

# Restart the virtual machine
compute_client.virtual_machines.restart(resource_group_name, vm_name)
```

Please note that you need to install the required Azure SDK for Python packages (`azure-identity` and `azure-mgmt-compute`) before running these scripts.
