#### Using CLI

To remediate the issues for Azure Virtual Machines using Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Enable Azure Security Center for Azure Virtual Machines:
   - Use the Azure CLI command `az vm update --name <vm_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --set "properties.securityProfile.securityCenterEnabled=true"` to enable Azure Security Center for a specific virtual machine.

2. Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) for Azure Virtual Machines:
   - Use the Azure CLI command `az network nsg rule create --name <rule_name> --nsg-name <nsg_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --priority <priority_number> --source-address-prefixes <source_address_prefix> --destination-port-ranges <destination_port_range> --access <access_type> --protocol <protocol>` to create a new NSG rule for a specific NSG and virtual machine.

3. Implement Azure Backup for Azure Virtual Machines:
   - Use the Azure CLI command `az backup protection enable-for-vm --vm <vm_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --policy-name <policy_name>` to enable Azure Backup protection for a specific virtual machine. Replace `<policy_name>` with the name of the backup policy you want to apply.

Please note that the actual values for `<vm_name>`, `<resource_group_name>`, `<rule_name>`, `<nsg_name>`, `<priority_number>`, `<source_address_prefix>`, `<destination_port_range>`, `<access_type>`, and `<protocol>` should be replaced with the appropriate values specific to your environment.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issues for Azure Virtual Machines using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are three examples of how you can remediate specific issues:

1. Example 1: Enabling Azure Disk Encryption for Virtual Machines
   - Install the required package: `pip install azure-mgmt-compute`
   - Use the following Python script to enable Azure Disk Encryption for a specific virtual machine:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Provide your Azure subscription ID and resource group name
subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
resource_group_name = 'your_resource_group_name'
vm_name = 'your_vm_name'

# Create the ComputeManagementClient
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Enable Azure Disk Encryption for the virtual machine
compute_client.virtual_machines.begin_enable_disk_encryption(resource_group_name, vm_name)
```

2. Example 2: Applying Network Security Group (NSG) rules to Virtual Machines
   - Install the required package: `pip install azure-mgmt-network`
   - Use the following Python script to apply NSG rules to a specific virtual machine:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Provide your Azure subscription ID and resource group name
subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
resource_group_name = 'your_resource_group_name'
vm_name = 'your_vm_name'
nsg_name = 'your_nsg_name'

# Create the NetworkManagementClient
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Get the virtual machine's network interface
network_interface = network_client.network_interfaces.get(resource_group_name, vm_name)

# Get the NSG associated with the network interface
nsg = network_client.network_security_groups.get(resource_group_name, nsg_name)

# Apply NSG rules to the network interface
network_interface.network_security_group = nsg
network_client.network_interfaces.begin_create_or_update(resource_group_name, vm_name, network_interface)
```

3. Example 3: Configuring Azure Backup for Virtual Machines
   - Install the required package: `pip install azure-mgmt-recoveryservices`
   - Use the following Python script to configure Azure Backup for a specific virtual machine:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.recoveryservices import RecoveryServicesClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Provide your Azure subscription ID and resource group name
subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
resource_group_name = 'your_resource_group_name'
vm_name = 'your_vm_name'
vault_name = 'your_vault_name'

# Create the RecoveryServicesClient
recovery_services_client = RecoveryServicesClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Get the virtual machine's ID
vm_id = f'/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group_name}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vm_name}'

# Configure Azure Backup for the virtual machine
recovery_services_client.backup_protected_items.begin_create_or_update(resource_group_name, vault_name, vm_id)
```

Please note that you need to replace the placeholders (`your_subscription_id`, `your_resource_group_name`, `your_vm_name`, etc.) with the actual values specific to your Azure environment.
