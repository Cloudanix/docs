### Event Information

- The Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.write event in Azure for AzureVirtualMachines refers to a write operation performed on a virtual machine (VM) resource in the Classic deployment model.
- This event indicates that a change or modification has been made to the configuration or properties of a VM in the Classic deployment model.
- It could include actions such as creating a new VM, updating the VM's size or settings, or deleting the VM from the Classic deployment model.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized creation of virtual machines: If security is impacted with Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.write permission, it means that an attacker can create virtual machines in the Azure environment without proper authorization. This can lead to the deployment of malicious instances that can compromise the security of the entire infrastructure.

2. Data exfiltration: With the ability to write to AzureVirtualMachines, an attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the virtual machines. They can gain access to the virtual machine disks, operating system files, and any other data stored within the instances. This can result in a significant data breach and compromise the confidentiality of the organization's information.

3. Unauthorized modifications: The Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.write permission allows an attacker to modify the configuration and settings of existing virtual machines. This can include changing network settings, adding or removing storage, modifying security groups, or even altering the operating system itself. Unauthorized modifications can disrupt the normal operation of the virtual machines and introduce vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the attacker.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized creation of virtual machines in Azure using the Azure console, follow these steps:

1. Review and update RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) permissions: 
   - Go to the Azure portal and navigate to the subscription or resource group where the unauthorized creation occurred.
   - Select "Access control (IAM)" from the left-hand menu.
   - Identify the role assignment that grants the Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.write permission to unauthorized users.
   - Remove the assignment or update it to restrict the permission to only authorized individuals or groups.

2. Enable Azure Policy to enforce VM creation restrictions:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to the subscription or resource group where the unauthorized creation occurred.
   - Select "Policies" from the left-hand menu.
   - Click on "Assignments" and then "Assign policy".
   - Choose the desired policy definition, such as "Allowed virtual machine SKUs" or "Allowed virtual machine image publishers".
   - Configure the policy to restrict the creation of virtual machines based on specific SKUs, image publishers, or other criteria.
   - Assign the policy to the appropriate scope, such as the subscription or resource group.

3. Monitor and audit virtual machine creation:
   - Utilize Azure Monitor or Azure Security Center to track and analyze virtual machine creation activities.
   - Set up alerts or notifications to be notified of any unauthorized virtual machine creation attempts.
   - Regularly review the logs and audit trails to identify any suspicious activities and take appropriate actions.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized virtual machine creation in Azure and ensure that only authorized individuals can deploy virtual machines in your environment.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate unauthorized creation of virtual machines in Azure using Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:
   - Identify the role or user with the Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.write permission.
   - Revoke the permission from the role or user using the `az role assignment delete` command. For example:
     ```
     az role assignment delete --assignee <assignee-id> --role "Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.write"
     ```

2. To remediate data exfiltration in Azure using Azure CLI, you can take the following actions:
   - Identify the role or user with the AzureVirtualMachines write permission.
   - Remove the permission from the role or user using the `az role assignment delete` command. For example:
     ```
     az role assignment delete --assignee <assignee-id> --role "AzureVirtualMachines.write"
     ```

3. To remediate unauthorized modifications of virtual machines in Azure using Azure CLI, you can perform the following steps:
   - Identify the role or user with the Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.write permission.
   - Remove the permission from the role or user using the `az role assignment delete` command. For example:
     ```
     az role assignment delete --assignee <assignee-id> --role "Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.write"
     ```

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized creation of virtual machines in Azure using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify and revoke unnecessary permissions: Review the access control settings for the affected resource group or subscription. Remove the Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.write permission from any user or role that does not require it.

2. Implement Azure Policy: Create an Azure Policy that enforces the required permissions for virtual machine creation. This policy can deny the creation of virtual machines if the Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.write permission is not explicitly granted to the user or role.

3. Monitor and alert on virtual machine creation: Set up Azure Monitor to track virtual machine creation events. Configure alerts to notify you whenever a new virtual machine is created. This will help you detect any unauthorized attempts and take immediate action.

Here's an example Python script that uses the Azure SDK for Python to revoke the Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.write permission:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.authorization import AuthorizationManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
authorization_client = AuthorizationManagementClient(credential, "<your_subscription_id>")

# Revoke the permission for a specific user or role assignment
authorization_client.role_assignments.delete("<your_scope>", "<role_assignment_id>")
```

Note: Replace `<your_subscription_id>`, `<your_scope>`, and `<role_assignment_id>` with the appropriate values for your environment.

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform these actions before executing the script.
