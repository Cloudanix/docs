### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Compute.sshPublicKeys.write event in AzureRealTime for AzureVirtualMachines refers to an event where a change is made to the SSH public keys associated with a virtual machine in Azure.
- This event indicates that a user or an automated process has added, modified, or deleted SSH public keys for the virtual machine, which are used for authentication purposes.
- It is important to monitor this event as it can help track any changes made to the SSH public keys, ensuring the security and access control of the virtual machine.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.Compute.sshPublicKeys.write event is triggered in AzureRealTime for AzureVirtualMachines, it could indicate that an unauthorized user or malicious actor has gained access to the SSH public keys associated with the virtual machine. This could potentially allow them to authenticate and gain unauthorized access to the virtual machine.

2. Remediation steps:
   - Immediately revoke the compromised SSH public key(s) from the affected virtual machine.
   - Generate new SSH key pair(s) for the virtual machine.
   - Update the SSH public key(s) on the virtual machine with the newly generated key pair(s).
   - Disable password-based authentication and enforce SSH key-based authentication for the virtual machine to prevent unauthorized access.

   Azure CLI commands for remediation:
   ```bash
   # Revoke the compromised SSH public key
   az vm update -g <resource_group_name> -n <vm_name> --remove ssh.publicKeys[<index>]

   # Generate new SSH key pair
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f <new_key_file>

   # Update SSH public key on the virtual machine
   az vm user update -g <resource_group_name> -n <vm_name> --username <username> --ssh-key-value "<new_public_key>"

   # Disable password-based authentication
   az vm update -g <resource_group_name> -n <vm_name> --set "properties.osProfile.linuxConfiguration.disablePasswordAuthentication=true"
   ```

3. Additional measures to enhance security:
   - Regularly rotate SSH key pairs for virtual machines.
   - Implement network security groups (NSGs) to restrict inbound SSH traffic to trusted sources.
   - Monitor and analyze logs and events related to SSH access for early detection of any suspicious activities.
