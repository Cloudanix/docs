### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Compute.snapshots.delete event in AzureRealTime for AzureVirtualMachines refers to the deletion of a snapshot associated with a virtual machine in the Azure cloud.
- This event indicates that a user or an automated process has initiated the deletion of a snapshot, which is a point-in-time copy of a virtual machine's disk.
- The event signifies that the snapshot has been successfully deleted and is no longer available for use or recovery purposes.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Microsoft.Compute.snapshots.delete event in Azure, they could potentially delete snapshots of Azure Virtual Machines. This could lead to data loss, disruption of services, and potential security breaches if sensitive information is stored in those snapshots.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have permissions to delete snapshots. Use Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to assign appropriate roles and permissions to users.
- Enable auditing and monitoring: Enable Azure Monitor to track and log all snapshot deletion events. This will help in identifying any unauthorized access or suspicious activities.
- Regular backups: Implement a backup strategy that includes regular snapshots and off-site backups. This will help in mitigating the impact of accidental or malicious snapshot deletions.

Azure CLI command to assign a role to a user:
```
az role assignment create --assignee <user-email> --role <role-name> --scope <resource-scope>
```

2. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.Compute.snapshots.delete event is triggered without proper validation or authorization checks, it could allow an attacker to delete snapshots of Azure Virtual Machines without proper permissions. This could result in data loss, service disruption, and potential unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Remediation:
- Implement access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or processes have the necessary permissions to delete snapshots. Use Azure RBAC to assign appropriate roles and permissions to users and service principals.
- Enable auditing and monitoring: Enable Azure Monitor to track and log all snapshot deletion events. Regularly review the logs for any suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.
- Implement backup and recovery procedures: Regularly backup snapshots and ensure that they are stored in a separate location or storage account. This will help in recovering from accidental or malicious snapshot deletions.

Azure CLI command to enable Azure Monitor for snapshot deletion events:
```
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name <diagnostic-settings-name> --resource <resource-id> --logs '[{"category": "Delete", "enabled": true}]'
```

3. Example of security impact: If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the Microsoft.Compute.snapshots.delete event in Azure, they could potentially delete snapshots of Azure Virtual Machines. This could lead to data loss, service disruption, and potential compromise of sensitive information if the snapshots contain sensitive data.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or processes have the necessary permissions to delete snapshots. Use Azure RBAC to assign appropriate roles and permissions to users and service principals.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for all user accounts with delete permissions for snapshots. This adds an extra layer of security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
- Regularly review and monitor permissions: Regularly review and audit the permissions assigned to users and service principals. Remove any unnecessary or excessive permissions to minimize the attack surface.

Azure CLI command to enable MFA for a user:
```
az ad user update --id <user-object-id> --force-change-password-next-login true
```
