Here's an example of a Python script to stop Azure virtual machines using the Azure SDK for Python (azure-mgmt-compute):
```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient

# Set your Azure subscription ID and resource group name
subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
resource_group_name = 'your_resource_group_name'

# Create a credential object using default Azure credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create a ComputeManagementClient object
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Set the name of the virtual machine to stop
virtual_machine_name = 'your_virtual_machine_name'

# Stop the virtual machine
compute_client.virtual_machines.begin_power_off(resource_group_name, virtual_machine_name)
```
Note: Make sure to install the required packages (azure-identity, azure-mgmt-compute) before running the script.
