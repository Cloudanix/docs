To remediate the issues for Azure Virtual Machines using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are three examples of how you can remediate specific issues:

1. Example 1: Enabling Azure Disk Encryption for Virtual Machines
   - Install the required package: `pip install azure-mgmt-compute`
   - Use the following Python script to enable Azure Disk Encryption for a specific virtual machine:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Provide your Azure subscription ID and resource group name
subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
resource_group_name = 'your_resource_group_name'

# Provide the name of the virtual machine
vm_name = 'your_vm_name'

# Create the ComputeManagementClient
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Enable Azure Disk Encryption for the virtual machine
compute_client.virtual_machines.begin_enable_disk_encryption(resource_group_name, vm_name)
```

2. Example 2: Resizing a Virtual Machine
   - Install the required package: `pip install azure-mgmt-compute`
   - Use the following Python script to resize a specific virtual machine:

```python

subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
resource_group_name = 'your_resource_group_name'

# Provide the name of the virtual machine
vm_name = 'your_vm_name'

# Provide the name of the NSG and the desired rules
nsg_name = 'your_nsg_name'
nsg_rules = [
    {
        'name': 'AllowSSH',
        'protocol': 'Tcp',
        'source_port_range': '*',
        'destination_port_range': '22',
        'source_address_prefix': '*',
        'destination_address_prefix': '*',
        'access': 'Allow',
        'priority': 100,
        'direction': 'Inbound'
    },
    {
        'name': 'AllowHTTP',
        'protocol': 'Tcp',
        'source_port_range': '*',
        'destination_port_range': '80',
        'source_address_prefix': '*',
        'destination_address_prefix': '*',
        'access': 'Allow',
        'priority': 200,
        'direction': 'Inbound'
    }
]

# Create the NetworkManagementClient
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Get the virtual machine's network interface
vm_nic = network_client.network_interfaces.get(resource_group_name, f'{vm_name}-nic')

# Get the NSG associated with the network interface
nsg = network_client.network_security_groups.get(resource_group_name, nsg_name)

# Update the NSG rules
nsg.security_rules = nsg_rules

# Update the NSG associated with the network interface
network_client.network_security_groups.begin_create_or_update(resource_group_name, nsg_name, nsg)

# Update the network interface
vm_nic.network_security_group = nsg

# Update the network interface associated with the virtual machine
network_client.network_interfaces.begin_create_or_update(resource_group_name, f'{vm_name}-nic', vm_nic)
```

Please note that you need to replace the placeholders (`your_subscription_id`, `your_resource_group_name`, `your_vm_name`, `your_nsg_name`, etc.) with the actual values specific to your Azure environment.
