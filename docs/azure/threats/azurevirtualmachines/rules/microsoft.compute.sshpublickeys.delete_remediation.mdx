### Event Information

- The Microsoft.Compute.sshPublicKeys.delete event in Azure for AzureVirtualMachines indicates that a SSH public key has been deleted for a virtual machine in Azure.
- This event signifies that the SSH access to the virtual machine has been modified, specifically in terms of removing a public key that was previously authorized for SSH access.
- It is important to monitor this event as it can help track any changes made to the SSH access configuration of Azure virtual machines, ensuring the security and access control of the environment.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized access: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Compute.sshPublicKeys.delete in Azure for AzureVirtualMachines, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the virtual machines. Deleting SSH public keys without proper authorization could allow malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to the virtual machines, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the data stored within.

2. Loss of control: Deleting SSH public keys without proper authorization can result in a loss of control over the virtual machines. This can lead to unauthorized modifications, data breaches, or even complete loss of the virtual machines. It is crucial to ensure that only authorized individuals or processes have the necessary permissions to delete SSH public keys.

3. Compliance violations: Deleting SSH public keys without proper authorization can also result in compliance violations. Many compliance standards, such as PCI DSS or HIPAA, require strict control over access to sensitive data. Unauthorized deletion of SSH public keys can lead to non-compliance with these standards, potentially resulting in legal and financial consequences for the organization. It is important to have proper access controls and auditing mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized deletion of SSH public keys.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized access and loss of control issues related to deleting SSH public keys for AzureVirtualMachines in Azure using the Azure console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Review and update access controls:
   - Identify and review the existing access controls for AzureVirtualMachines.
   - Ensure that only authorized individuals or processes have the necessary permissions to delete SSH public keys.
   - Update the access controls to restrict the deletion of SSH public keys to only trusted and authorized entities.

2. Implement monitoring and alerts:
   - Set up monitoring and alerts to detect any unauthorized deletion of SSH public keys.
   - Configure alerts to notify the appropriate personnel or security team when such events occur.
   - Regularly review the monitoring logs and alerts to identify any suspicious activities or potential security incidents.

3. Educate and enforce security best practices:
   - Provide training and awareness programs to educate users and administrators about the importance of proper authorization and access controls.
   - Emphasize the risks associated with unauthorized deletion of SSH public keys and the potential impact on security and compliance.
   - Enforce security best practices by regularly auditing access controls, reviewing permissions, and conducting periodic security assessments.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risks of unauthorized access, loss of control, and compliance violations associated with deleting SSH public keys for AzureVirtualMachines in Azure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unauthorized access, loss of control, and compliance violations related to deleting SSH public keys for AzureVirtualMachines in Azure using Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Ensure that only authorized individuals or processes have the necessary permissions to delete SSH public keys. Grant the appropriate roles and permissions to users or service principals based on the principle of least privilege.

```bash
# Grant a user or service principal the necessary permissions to delete SSH public keys
az role assignment create --assignee <principalId> --role "Virtual Machine Contributor" --scope /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<virtualMachineName>
```

2. Enable Azure Monitor for monitoring and alerting: Set up Azure Monitor to track and monitor any changes or deletions of SSH public keys. Create alerts to notify administrators or security teams when unauthorized deletions occur.

```bash
# Enable Azure Monitor for the virtual machine
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name <diagnosticSettingsName> --resource /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<virtualMachineName> --logs '[{"category": "DeleteSSHKey", "enabled": true}]'
```

3. Implement Azure Policy: Use Azure Policy to enforce compliance standards and prevent unauthorized deletion of SSH public keys. Create a policy that denies the deletion of SSH public keys without proper authorization.

```bash
# Create an Azure Policy definition to deny the deletion of SSH public keys
az policy definition create --name "deny-delete-ssh-public-keys" --rules '{
  "if": {
    "allOf": [
      {
        "field": "type",
        "equals": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines"
      },
      {
        "field": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/deleteSshPublicKeys",
        "exists": "true"
      },
      {
        "field": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/deleteSshPublicKeys",
        "notEquals": "authorized"
      }
    ]
  },
  "then": {
    "effect": "deny"
  }
}'
```

By implementing RBAC, enabling Azure Monitor, and using Azure Policy, you can mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access, loss of control, and compliance violations when deleting SSH public keys for AzureVirtualMachines in Azure.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized access, loss of control, and compliance violations related to deleting SSH public keys for AzureVirtualMachines in Azure, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized individuals or processes have the necessary permissions to delete SSH public keys. You can use Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to assign appropriate roles and permissions to users or service principals. Here's an example of how to assign a role to a user using the Azure SDK for Python:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.authorization import AuthorizationManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create the Authorization Management client
authorization_client = AuthorizationManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Assign a role to a user
authorization_client.role_assignments.create(
    scope="/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vm_name}",
    role_definition_id="/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/{role_definition_id}",
    principal_id="{user_object_id}"
)
```

2. Enable auditing and monitoring: Implement auditing and monitoring mechanisms to track any unauthorized deletion of SSH public keys. Azure provides Azure Monitor, which can be used to collect and analyze logs related to Azure resources. You can enable diagnostic settings for Azure Virtual Machines to capture SSH public key deletion events. Here's an example of how to enable diagnostic settings using the Azure SDK for Python:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create the Monitor Management client
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Enable diagnostic settings for Azure Virtual Machine
monitor_client.diagnostic_settings.create_or_update(
    resource_uri="/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vm_name}",
    name="{diagnostic_settings_name}",
    parameters={
        "logs": [
            {
                "category": "DeletePublicKey",
                "enabled": True
            }
        ]
    }
)
```

3. Implement continuous security monitoring: Regularly review logs and monitor for any suspicious activities related to SSH public key deletion. You can leverage Azure Sentinel, a cloud-native SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution, to detect and respond to security incidents. Additionally, consider implementing automated alerts or notifications to promptly identify and mitigate any unauthorized access attempts.
