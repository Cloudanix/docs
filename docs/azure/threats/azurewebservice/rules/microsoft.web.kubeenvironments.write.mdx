     ```python
     from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
     from azure.monitor.query import LogsQueryClient

     # Authenticate using the default credentials
     credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

     # Create a LogsQueryClient
     logs_query_client = LogsQueryClient(credential)

     # Query the average response time
     response = logs_query_client.query(
         workspace_id='my-workspace-id',
         query='AppRequests | summarize avg(DurationMs) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)',
         timespan='PT1H'
     )

     # Process the query response
     for row in response.tables[0].rows:
         time_generated = row[0]
         avg_duration_ms = row[1]
         print(f'Time Generated: {time_generated}, Average Duration (ms): {avg_duration_ms}')
     ```
