1. Review and update permissions: 
   - Navigate to the Azure portal and open the AzureWebService resource.
   - Go to the "Access control (IAM)" tab.
   - Review the existing permissions assigned to the Microsoft.Web.customApis.Write role.
   - Remove any unauthorized or unnecessary users or groups from this role.
   - Ensure that only trusted individuals or groups have the necessary permissions.

2. Enable Azure AD authentication:
   - In the Azure portal, go to the AzureWebService resource.
   - Open the "Authentication / Authorization" settings.
   - Enable Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication for the AzureWebService.
   - Configure the appropriate Azure AD roles and permissions for accessing and modifying custom APIs.
   - This will ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access and modify the custom APIs.

3. Implement monitoring and auditing:
   - Enable Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center for the AzureWebService resource.
   - Configure alerts and notifications for any suspicious activities related to custom APIs.
   - Regularly review the logs and audit trails to detect any unauthorized access attempts or modifications.
   - Implement continuous monitoring and proactive response mechanisms to mitigate potential security risks.

By following these steps, you can remediate unauthorized access, data integrity risks, and escalation of privileges in AzureWebService, enhancing the overall security of your Azure environment.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate unauthorized access to the Microsoft.Web.customApis.Write permission in AzureWebService, you can follow these steps using Azure CLI commands:

- Identify the compromised permission: `az webapp config show --name <webapp_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --query "customApisWrite"` This command will show the current value of the Microsoft.Web.customApis.Write permission.

- Revoke the compromised permission: `az webapp config set --name <webapp_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --custom-apis-write false` This command will revoke the Microsoft.Web.customApis.Write permission, preventing unauthorized access.

- Monitor and investigate: Continuously monitor the AzureWebService for any suspicious activities or attempts to modify custom APIs. Investigate any potential security breaches and take appropriate actions to mitigate further risks.

2. To remediate data integrity risks associated with the Microsoft.Web.customApis.Write permission in AzureWebService, you can take the following steps using Azure CLI commands:

- Enable auditing and logging: `az webapp log config --name <webapp_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --application-logging true --detailed-error-messages true` This command will enable auditing and logging for the web app, allowing you to track any modifications or tampering with custom APIs.

- Implement data validation and checksums: Apply data validation techniques and checksums to ensure the integrity of the data processed by the custom APIs. This can help detect any unauthorized modifications or tampering.

- Regularly review logs and audit trails: Monitor the logs and audit trails generated by the web app to identify any suspicious activities or unauthorized modifications. Investigate and take appropriate actions to mitigate any identified risks.

3. To remediate the escalation of privileges resulting from unauthorized access to the Microsoft.Web.customApis.Write permission in AzureWebService, you can follow these steps using Azure CLI commands:

- Review and update role-based access control (RBAC): `az role assignment list --assignee <user_or_group_id> --scope <resource_group_or_subscription_id>` This command will list the current role assignments for the specified user or group. Review and update the RBAC assignments to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions.

- Implement just-in-time (JIT) access: Use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enable JIT access for privileged roles. This will limit the time window during which users have elevated privileges, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for all users with elevated privileges, including those with access to modify or write custom APIs. This adds an extra layer of security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

Note: The specific CLI commands may vary depending on your Azure environment setup and configuration. Please refer to the Azure CLI documentation for detailed command usage and options.

subscription_id = "<your_subscription_id>"
resource_group_name = "<your_resource_group_name>"
webapp_name = "<your_webapp_name>"

# Create the WebSiteManagementClient
web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Get the existing web app
web_app = web_client.web_apps.get(resource_group_name, webapp_name)

# Revoke the Microsoft.Web.customApis.Write permission for unauthorized users
web_app.site_config.app_settings["WEBSITE_WEB_CUSTOMAPIS_WRITE_ENABLED"] = "false"
