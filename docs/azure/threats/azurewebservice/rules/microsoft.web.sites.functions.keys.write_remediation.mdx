#### Using Python

To remediate the issues for Azure AzureWebService using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Monitoring and Alerting:
   - Use the Azure Monitor service to set up monitoring and alerting for your Azure Web Service.
   - Create a metric alert to trigger an action when a specific condition is met, such as high CPU usage or low memory availability.
   - Use the Azure SDK for Python to programmatically create and manage alerts. Here's an example script:

   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

   # Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

   # Create a MonitorManagementClient
   monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

   # Define the alert rule parameters
   alert_rule_params = {
       'location': 'eastus',
       'name': 'High CPU Alert',
       'description': 'Alert triggered when CPU usage exceeds 80%',
       'severity': 2,
       'enabled': True,
       'condition': {
           'odata.type': 'Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.ThresholdRuleCondition',
           'dataSource': {
               'odata.type': 'Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.RuleMetricDataSource',
               'resourceUri': '/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{web_service_name}',
               'metricName': 'CpuPercentage',
               'operator': 'GreaterThan',
               'threshold': 80
           }
       },
       'actions': [
           {
               'odata.type': 'Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.RuleEmailAction',
               'sendToServiceOwners': True
           }
       ]
   }

   # Create the alert rule
   monitor_client.alert_rules.create_or_update('{resource_group}', '{web_service_name}', '{alert_rule_name}', alert_rule_params)
   ```

2. Security and Compliance:
   - Implement Azure Security Center to continuously monitor the security posture of your Azure Web Service.
   - Enable the Azure Security Center recommendations and follow the guidance provided to remediate any security vulnerabilities.

   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenterManagementClient
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

   # Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

   # Create a SecurityCenterManagementClient
   security_center_client = SecurityCenterManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

   # Enable Azure Security Center for the web service
   security_center_client.auto_provisioning_settings.create_or_update('{resource_group}', '{web_service_name}', {
       'name': 'default',
       'location': 'eastus',
       'properties': {
           'autoProvision': 'On',
           'tier': 'Standard'
       }
   })
   ```

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Use Azure Application Insights to monitor the performance of your Azure Web Service and identify any bottlenecks.
   - Analyze the telemetry data collected by Application Insights to optimize the performance of your web service.
   - Use the Azure SDK for Python to programmatically configure and use Application Insights. Here's an example script:

   ```python
   from azure.monitor.opentelemetry.exporter import AzureMonitorTraceExporter
   from azure.monitor.opentelemetry.exporter import AzureMonitorMetricsExporter
   from opentelemetry import trace
   from opentelemetry import metrics
   from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
   from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics import MeterProvider
   from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics.export import ConsoleMetricsExporter

   # Create a TracerProvider and configure Azure Monitor Trace Exporter
   trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
   tracer_provider = trace.get_tracer_provider()
   tracer_provider.add_span_processor(
       AzureMonitorTraceExporter(
           connection_string='InstrumentationKey={instrumentation_key}'
       )
   )

   # Create a MeterProvider and configure Azure Monitor Metrics Exporter
   metrics.set_meter_provider(MeterProvider())
   meter_provider = metrics.get_meter_provider()
   meter_provider.add_meter_processor(
       AzureMonitorMetricsExporter(
           connection_string='InstrumentationKey={instrumentation_key}'
       )
   )

   # Use the tracer and meter to instrument your code and collect telemetry data
   tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
   meter = meter_provider.get_meter(__name__)

   with tracer.start_as_current_span('my_operation'):
       # Perform your operation

   with meter.measure_int_put('my_metric', 42):
       # Record a metric value
   ```
