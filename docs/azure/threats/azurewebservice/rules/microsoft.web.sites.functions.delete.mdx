### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The `microsoft.web.sites.functions.delete` event in Azure Realtime for Azure Web Service refers to the deletion of a function within an Azure Function App.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process deletes a specific function from the Azure Function App.
- It is important to note that this event only applies to Azure Function Apps and not other types of Azure Web Services.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the microsoft.web.sites.functions.delete event is triggered in Azure Web Service, it could indicate that a function app within the web service has been deleted. This can potentially impact security if the deleted function app contained sensitive code or access credentials, as an attacker could gain unauthorized access or exploit the deleted resources.

Remediation:
- Regularly monitor and review the activity logs and audit logs in Azure to identify any unexpected or unauthorized deletion events.
- Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to restrict access to function apps and ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete them.
- Enable Azure Backup for function apps to have a backup of the code and configurations, allowing for easy restoration in case of accidental deletion.

Azure CLI command to enable Azure Backup for a function app:
```
az functionapp config appsettings set --name <function_app_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --settings WEBSITE_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE=true
```

2. Example of security impact: If the microsoft.web.sites.functions.delete event is triggered in Azure Web Service, it could indicate that an attacker has gained unauthorized access to the Azure portal or API and deleted the function app. This can lead to a potential data breach or disruption of critical business processes.

Remediation:
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts with access to the Azure portal or API.
- Regularly review and update access control policies to ensure that only necessary permissions are granted to users and service principals.
- Enable Azure Security Center and configure alerts for suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.

Azure CLI command to enable Azure Security Center:
```
az security pricing create --name Default --tier Standard
```

3. Example of security impact: If the microsoft.web.sites.functions.delete event is triggered in Azure Web Service, it could indicate a misconfiguration or vulnerability in the function app itself, allowing an attacker to delete the app or its resources. This can result in service disruption or loss of critical functionality.

Remediation:
- Regularly scan and assess the function app for vulnerabilities using Azure Security Center or third-party vulnerability scanning tools.
- Implement secure coding practices and follow Azure's security recommendations for function apps.
- Enable Azure Monitor and configure alerts for any suspicious or unexpected activities related to the function app.

Azure CLI command to enable Azure Monitor for a function app:
```
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name <diagnostic_settings_name> --resource <function_app_resource_id> --logs '[{"category": "AppServiceConsoleLogs","enabled": true},{"category": "AppServiceFileAuditLogs","enabled": true}]'
```
