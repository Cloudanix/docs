### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Web.serverfarms.Delete event in Azure Realtime for Azure Web Service indicates that a server farm (also known as an App Service plan) has been deleted in Azure.
- This event signifies that the resources associated with the server farm, such as the underlying virtual machines and storage, have been removed.
- It is important to note that deleting a server farm will also result in the deletion of any web apps or services that were hosted on that server farm.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Microsoft.Web/serverfarms/delete event in Azure, they can potentially delete the entire server farm associated with the Azure Web Service. This can lead to a complete disruption of the service and potential loss of data.

Remediation:
- Enable Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to ensure that only authorized users have permissions to delete server farms. Assign the appropriate roles to users based on their responsibilities.
- Implement Azure AD (Active Directory) authentication for the Azure Web Service, ensuring that only authenticated users can access and perform actions on the service.
- Regularly monitor and review the Azure Activity Log and Azure Security Center alerts to detect any unauthorized access or suspicious activities related to the server farms.

Azure CLI command to assign a role to a user:
```
az role assignment create --assignee <user-object-id> --role <role-name> --scope <resource-scope>
```

2. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.Web/serverfarms/delete event is triggered without proper validation or authorization checks, it can be exploited by an attacker to delete critical server farms. This can result in service downtime, data loss, and potential financial losses.

Remediation:
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users accessing the Azure Web Service management portal or APIs.
- Enable Azure Resource Locks to prevent accidental or unauthorized deletion of server farms. Apply the appropriate lock level (CanNotDelete or ReadOnly) to the resource group or individual resources.
- Regularly backup the server farms and associated data to an offsite location or another Azure region to mitigate the impact of accidental or malicious deletions.

Azure CLI command to apply a resource lock:
```
az lock create --name <lock-name> --lock-type CanNotDelete --resource-group <resource-group-name> --resource <resource-name>
```

3. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.Web/serverfarms/delete event is triggered without proper auditing and monitoring in place, it can go unnoticed, allowing an attacker to delete server farms without detection. This can lead to extended service downtime, loss of customer trust, and potential compliance violations.

Remediation:
- Enable Azure Monitor and configure alerts for the Microsoft.Web/serverfarms/delete event. Set up email notifications or integrate with a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system to receive real-time alerts for any deletion attempts.
- Implement Azure Policy to enforce specific conditions or restrictions on server farm deletion, such as requiring approval from a designated administrator or limiting deletion to specific time windows.
- Regularly review and analyze the Azure Activity Log and Azure Monitor logs to identify any suspicious or unauthorized activities related to server farm deletions.

Azure CLI command to create an Azure Policy definition:
```
az policy definition create --name <policy-name> --rules <policy-rules> --mode Indexed
```

Note: The `<policy-rules>` should include conditions and actions specific to server farm deletion restrictions.
