  `az network traffic-manager profile create --name <traffic_manager_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --routing-method Priority --unique-dns-name <unique_dns_name> --ttl 30 --protocol HTTP --port 80`

Note: Replace `<webapp_name>`, `<resource_group_name>`, `<storage_account_name>`, `<traffic_manager_name>`, and `<unique_dns_name>` with the appropriate values for your Azure environment.

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized access: To remediate unauthorized access to the Microsoft.Web.staticSites.config.Write, you can implement the following steps using Python scripts:

```python
import os

# Set the path to the Microsoft.Web.staticSites.config file
config_file_path = "/path/to/Microsoft.Web.staticSites.config"

# Set the desired permissions for the config file
desired_permissions = "0600"  # Example: Read and write permissions for the owner only

# Set the owner of the config file
desired_owner = "owner_username"

# Set the group of the config file
desired_group = "owner_group"

# Change the permissions and ownership of the config file
os.chmod(config_file_path, int(desired_permissions, 8))
os.chown(config_file_path, desired_owner, desired_group)
```

2. Data integrity: To remediate the risk of data integrity compromise in the Microsoft.Web.staticSites.config file, you can implement the following steps using Python scripts:

```python
import os

# Set the path to the Microsoft.Web.staticSites.config file
config_file_path = "/path/to/Microsoft.Web.staticSites.config"

# Calculate the hash of the config file
def calculate_file_hash(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "rb") as file:
        file_content = file.read()
        file_hash = hashlib.sha256(file_content).hexdigest()
    return file_hash

# Verify the integrity of the config file
def verify_file_integrity(file_path, expected_hash):
    current_hash = calculate_file_hash(file_path)
    if current_hash != expected_hash:
        # File integrity compromised, take appropriate actions
        # For example, restore the config file from a trusted backup
        # Or investigate the unauthorized modifications
        pass

# Set the expected hash value for the config file
expected_hash = "expected_hash_value"

# Verify the integrity of the config file
verify_file_integrity(config_file_path, expected_hash)
```

3. Service availability: To remediate the risk of service availability disruption due to compromised Microsoft.Web.staticSites.config.Write, you can implement the following steps using Python scripts:

# Set the path to the Microsoft.Web.staticSites.config file
config_file_path = "/path/to/Microsoft.Web.staticSites.config"

# Set the desired configuration settings for the Azure Web Service
desired_settings = {
    "setting1": "value1",
    "setting2": "value2",
    # Add more desired settings as needed
}

# Update the configuration settings in the config file
def update_config_settings(file_path, settings):
    with open(file_path, "r") as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        for setting_key, setting_value in settings.items():
            if setting_key in line:
                lines[i] = f"{setting_key}={setting_value}\n"
                break

    with open(file_path, "w") as file:
        file.writelines(lines)

# Update the configuration settings in the config file
update_config_settings(config_file_path, desired_settings)
```

Note: These scripts provide a basic framework for remediation and may need to be customized based on your specific requirements and environment.
