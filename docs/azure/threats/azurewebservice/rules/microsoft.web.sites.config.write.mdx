#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized access: To remediate unauthorized access to the AzureWebService configuration settings, you can follow these steps using Azure CLI:

- Identify the compromised security of Microsoft.Web.sites.config.Write by monitoring security logs or conducting a security audit.
- Remove any unauthorized users or accounts from the role assignment for Microsoft.Web.sites.config.Write.
- Update the access control list (ACL) for Microsoft.Web.sites.config.Write to only include authorized and trusted individuals or groups.
- Regularly review and monitor the ACL to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions.

CLI commands:
```
# Remove unauthorized user from role assignment
az role assignment delete --assignee <unauthorized_user> --role "Microsoft.Web/sites/config.write" --scope <resource_scope>

# Update ACL to include authorized users
az webapp config access-restriction add --resource-group <resource_group> --name <webapp_name> --rule-name <rule_name> --action Allow --ip-address <authorized_ip_address>
```

2. Injection attacks: To remediate the impact of compromised security on injection attacks, you can take the following steps using Azure CLI:

- Conduct a thorough security assessment to identify any injected malicious code or configuration settings.
- Remove any injected code or configuration settings from the AzureWebService.
- Implement input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent future injection attacks.
- Regularly monitor and update security measures to stay protected against new injection attack vectors.

CLI commands:
```
# Identify and remove injected code or configuration settings
az webapp config appsettings delete --resource-group <resource_group> --name <webapp_name> --setting-names <injected_setting_names>

# Implement input validation and sanitization techniques
# This may involve updating the application code or using security features provided by Azure, such as Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF).
```

3. Misconfiguration risks: To remediate misconfigurations resulting from compromised security, you can follow these steps using Azure CLI:

- Conduct a comprehensive review of the AzureWebService configuration settings to identify any misconfigurations.
- Correct any misconfigurations by updating the appropriate settings.
- Implement configuration management practices to ensure consistent and secure configuration across all environments.
- Regularly audit and monitor the configuration settings to detect and remediate any new misconfigurations.

CLI commands:
```
# Identify and correct misconfigurations
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <resource_group> --name <webapp_name> --settings <corrected_settings>

# Implement configuration management practices
# This may involve using Azure Resource Manager templates or Azure Policy to enforce desired configuration settings.
```

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized access: To remediate unauthorized access to the AzureWebService configuration settings, you can use the Azure Python SDK to manage access control. Here's an example script that restricts write access to the Microsoft.Web.sites.config resource:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Specify the resource group and web app name
resource_group_name = "your_resource_group"
web_app_name = "your_web_app"

# Get the existing access control list for the web app
access_control = web_client.web_apps.get_access_control(
    resource_group_name, web_app_name
)

# Remove write access for Microsoft.Web.sites.config
access_control.write.remove("Microsoft.Web.sites.config")

# Update the access control list
web_client.web_apps.update_access_control(
    resource_group_name, web_app_name, access_control
)
```

2. Injection attacks: To mitigate the risk of injection attacks, it is important to validate and sanitize user input. Here's an example Python script that demonstrates input validation for an Azure Function:

```python
import logging
import azure.functions as func

def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    # Get the input parameter from the request
    input_param = req.params.get('input_param')

    # Validate the input parameter
    if not input_param:
        return func.HttpResponse(
            "Invalid input parameter",
            status_code=400
        )

    # Sanitize the input parameter
    sanitized_param = sanitize_input(input_param)

    # Process the sanitized parameter
    result = process_input(sanitized_param)

    return func.HttpResponse(f"Result: {result}")

def sanitize_input(input_param):
    # Implement your input sanitization logic here
    sanitized_param = input_param.strip()
    return sanitized_param

def process_input(input_param):
    # Implement your processing logic here
    result = input_param.upper()
    return result
```

3. Misconfiguration risks: To prevent misconfigurations in the AzureWebService, you can use Azure Policy to enforce compliance with configuration standards. Here's an example Python script that creates an Azure Policy assignment to ensure the Microsoft.Web.sites.config.Write permission is only granted to authorized users:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.resource import PolicyClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
policy_client = PolicyClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Specify the policy assignment details
policy_assignment_name = "restrict-web-config-write"
policy_definition_id = "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/{policy_definition_id}"
scope = "/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group_name}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{web_app_name}"

# Create the policy assignment
policy_assignment = policy_client.policy_assignments.create(
    scope,
    policy_assignment_name,
    {
        "policyDefinitionId": policy_definition_id,
        "parameters": {
            "allowedPrincipals": {
                "value": ["<list of authorized user or group identities>"]
            }
        }
    }
)
```

Note: Replace the placeholders (`<list of authorized user or group identities>`, `{policy_definition_id}`, `{subscription_id}`, `{resource_group_name}`, `{web_app_name}`) with the appropriate values for your environment.
