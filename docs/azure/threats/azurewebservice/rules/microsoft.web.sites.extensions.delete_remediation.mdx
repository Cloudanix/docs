### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The `microsoft.web.sites.extensions.delete` event in Azure Realtime for Azure Web Service refers to the deletion of an extension associated with a web app in Azure.
- This event is triggered when an extension, such as a custom module or a third-party add-on, is removed from the web app.
- It is important to note that this event does not indicate the deletion of the entire web app itself, but rather the removal of a specific extension from the web app.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the microsoft.web.sites.extensions.delete event is triggered in Azure for the Azure Web Service, it could indicate that a critical extension or plugin has been deleted from the web application. This can potentially lead to a security vulnerability, as the deleted extension may have provided important security features such as authentication, authorization, or input validation.

2. Remediation steps:
   - Identify the deleted extension: Check the logs or audit trail to determine which extension was deleted.
   - Restore the extension: If a backup or previous version of the extension is available, restore it to the web application.
   - Update security measures: Review the security measures in place and ensure that any gaps created by the deleted extension are addressed. This may involve implementing alternative security controls or finding a suitable replacement for the deleted extension.
   - Monitor for further incidents: Set up monitoring and alerts to detect any similar events in the future, and investigate any suspicious activities promptly.

   Azure CLI command to restore a deleted extension:
   ```
   az webapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <webapp-name> --src <path-to-zip-file>
   ```

   This command allows you to deploy a previously backed up or downloaded extension as a zip file to the Azure Web App.

3. Preventive measures:
   - Regular backups: Ensure that regular backups of the web application and its extensions are performed, so that in case of accidental deletion, the extensions can be easily restored.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC): Implement RBAC to restrict access to critical resources and prevent unauthorized deletion of extensions.
   - Continuous monitoring: Set up monitoring and logging mechanisms to detect and alert on any suspicious activities or unauthorized changes to the web application or its extensions.
