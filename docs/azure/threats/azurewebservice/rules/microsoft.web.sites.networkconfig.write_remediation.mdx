### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "microsoft.web.sites.networkConfig.write" event in Azure Realtime for Azure Web Service refers to a configuration change made to the network settings of the web application.
- This event indicates that there has been a modification to the network configuration of the Azure Web Service, such as changes to the virtual network, subnet, or IP restrictions.
- It is important to monitor this event as it can help track any changes made to the network configuration, ensuring that the web application remains secure and properly connected to other resources in the Azure environment.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the `microsoft.web.sites.networkConfig.write` event is triggered in Azure Real-time for Azure Web Service, it could indicate that there has been a modification to the network configuration of the web application. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities such as exposing the application to unauthorized network access or allowing traffic from untrusted sources.

2. Remediation steps:
   - Identify the specific changes made to the network configuration by reviewing the event details and logs.
   - Roll back the changes to the previous known good configuration, if possible.
   - If the changes were intentional but not authorized, investigate the source of the event and take appropriate actions to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Implement network security best practices, such as using network security groups (NSGs) to control inbound and outbound traffic, enabling firewall rules, and restricting access to only trusted networks or IP ranges.
   - Regularly monitor and review network configuration changes to detect any unauthorized modifications.

Example CLI command to review network configuration changes in Azure Web Service:
```
az webapp show --name <webapp_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --query "siteConfig" --output json
```

Example CLI command to roll back network configuration changes in Azure Web Service:
```
az webapp config set --name <webapp_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --generic-configurations "{\"networkConfig\":{\"properties\":{\"subnetResourceId\":\"<previous_subnet_id>\"}}}"
```

Note: Replace `<webapp_name>`, `<resource_group_name>`, and `<previous_subnet_id>` with the actual values specific to your environment.
