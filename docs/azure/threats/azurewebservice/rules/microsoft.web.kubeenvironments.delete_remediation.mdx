### Event Information

- The Microsoft.Web.kubeEnvironments.delete event in Azure for AzureWebService indicates the deletion of a Kubernetes environment associated with an Azure Web Service.
- This event signifies that the Kubernetes environment, which is used to manage and orchestrate containerized applications, has been removed from the Azure Web Service.
- It is important to note that deleting a Kubernetes environment will also remove any associated resources and configurations, so caution should be exercised before performing this action.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with Microsoft.Web.kubeEnvironments.delete in Azure for AzureWebService, one example could be an unauthorized user gaining access to the AzureWebService and deleting kubeEnvironments. This could lead to the loss of critical resources and disruption of services.

2. Data exposure: Another example could be if the deletion of kubeEnvironments is not properly handled, it may result in the exposure of sensitive data. If the kubeEnvironments contain any confidential information, such as API keys or credentials, an unauthorized deletion could potentially expose this information to malicious actors.

3. Service disruption: The deletion of kubeEnvironments in AzureWebService can also impact the availability and reliability of the service. If the kubeEnvironments are not properly backed up or if the deletion process is not handled correctly, it could lead to service disruptions and downtime for the AzureWebService, affecting its users and potentially causing financial losses.

   ```python
   from azure.monitor import MonitorClient
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   monitor_client = MonitorClient(credential)

   # Create a metric alert
   monitor_client.metric_alerts.create_or_update(
       resource_group_name='<resource_group_name>',
       rule_name='<alert_rule_name>',
       parameters={
           'location': '<azure_region>',
           'enabled': True,
           'scopes': ['/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group_name>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<web_service_name>'],
           'condition': {
               'allOf': [
                   {
                       'name': 'Percentage CPU',
                       'operator': 'GreaterThan',
                       'threshold': 80,
                       'timeAggregation': 'Average',
                       'dimensions': [
                           {

                               'operator': 'Include',
                               'values': ['*']
                           }
                       ]
                   }
               ]
           },
           'actions': {
               'actionGroups': [
                   {
                       'actionGroupId': '<action_group_id>'
                   }
               ]
           }
       }
   )
   ```

2. Security and Compliance:

   - Enable Azure Security Center's Just-in-Time (JIT) VM access to restrict access to your virtual machines.
   - Use the Azure SDK for Python to programmatically enable JIT VM access. Here's an example script:

   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   security_center_client = SecurityCenter(credential)

   # Enable JIT VM access
   security_center_client.jit_network_access_policies.create_or_update(
       resource_group_name='<resource_group_name>',
       jit_network_access_policy_name='<policy_name>',
       parameters={
           'location': '<azure_region>',
           'virtualMachines': [
               {
                   'id': '/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group_name>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<vm_name>',
                   'ports': [
                       {
                           'number': 22,
                           'protocol': 'Tcp',
                           'allowedSourceAddressPrefixes': ['<allowed_source_ip>']
                       }
                   ]
               }
           ]
       }
   )
   ```

3. Cost Optimization:
   - Utilize Azure Cost Management and Billing to monitor and optimize the costs of your Azure Web Service.
   - Enable cost alerts to receive notifications when your spending exceeds a certain threshold.
   - Use the Azure SDK for Python to programmatically create cost alerts. Here's an example script:

   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.costmanagement import CostManagementClient
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   cost_management_client = CostManagementClient(credential)

   # Create a cost alert
   cost_management_client.alerts.create_or_update(
       scope='/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group_name>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<web_service_name>',
       alert_name='<alert_name>',
       parameters={
           'alertType': 'ActualCost',
           'threshold': 1000,
           'timeGrain': 'Monthly',
           'enabled': True,
           'notificationEnabled': True,
