### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "microsoft.web.sites.backups.delete" event in Azure for Azure Web Service refers to the deletion of a backup for a web application hosted on Azure.
- This event indicates that a backup of the web application has been removed from the Azure platform.
- It is important to note that deleting a backup is a permanent action and cannot be undone, so caution should be exercised when performing this operation.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with `microsoft.web.sites.backups.delete` in Azure for Azure Web Service, it means that unauthorized individuals or processes have the ability to delete backups of the web service, potentially leading to data loss or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

To remediate this issue for Azure Web Service using the Azure console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) using your Azure account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Azure Web Service that is impacted by the security issue.
3. Click on the "Access control (IAM)" tab in the left-hand menu.
4. Click on the "+ Add" button to add a new role assignment.
5. In the "Add role assignment" panel, select the appropriate role that restricts the ability to delete backups, such as "Contributor" or "Backup Contributor".
6. In the "Assign access to" field, select the appropriate user, group, or service principal that should have the restricted access.
7. Click on the "Save" button to apply the role assignment.
8. Repeat steps 4-7 if you need to add additional role assignments for other users, groups, or service principals.

By following these steps, you can restrict the ability to delete backups for the Azure Web Service, enhancing the security of your environment.

#### Using CLI

1. Example of security impact: The `microsoft.web.sites.backups.delete` event in Azure can potentially lead to the deletion of backups for the Azure Web Service. This can result in data loss and make it difficult to recover from any potential incidents or disasters.

2. Remediation steps using Azure CLI:
   - Step 1: Install Azure CLI if not already installed.
   - Step 2: Open the Azure CLI and authenticate with your Azure account.
   - Step 3: Identify the affected Azure Web Service by its resource group and name.
   - Step 4: Disable the `microsoft.web.sites.backups.delete` event for the Azure Web Service using the following command:
     ```
     az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name <diagnostic-settings-name> --resource <resource-id> --logs '[{"category": "BackupLogs", "enabled": false}]'
     ```
   - Step 5: Verify that the event has been successfully disabled by checking the diagnostic settings for the Azure Web Service.

Note: Replace `<diagnostic-settings-name>` with a suitable name for the diagnostic settings and `<resource-id>` with the resource ID of the Azure Web Service.



#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact: The `microsoft.web.sites.backups.delete` event in Azure can potentially lead to a security breach if unauthorized individuals gain access to delete backups of the Azure Web Service. This can result in data loss or compromise of sensitive information.

2. Remediation for Azure Web Service using Python:
   - Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete backups.
   - Use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Azure CLI commands in Python to define and enforce backup retention policies, ensuring that backups are retained for a specific duration before deletion.

Python script example using Azure SDK for Python (azure-mgmt-web) to delete backups for Azure Web Service:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient

# Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Provide your Azure subscription ID and resource group name
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
resource_group_name = 'your-resource-group-name'

# Provide the name of your Azure Web Service
web_service_name = 'your-web-service-name'

# Create the WebSiteManagementClient
web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Get the list of backups for the Azure Web Service
backups = web_client.web_apps.list_backups(resource_group_name, web_service_name)

# Delete the backups
for backup in backups:
    web_client.web_apps.delete_backup(resource_group_name, web_service_name, backup.name)
```

Note: Make sure to install the required Python packages (`azure-identity`, `azure-mgmt-web`) before running the script.
