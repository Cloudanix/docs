#### Using Python

To remediate the issues for Azure AzureWebService using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Monitoring and Alerting:
   - Use the Azure Monitor service to set up monitoring and alerting for your Azure Web Service.
   - Create a metric alert to trigger an action when a specific condition is met, such as high CPU usage or low memory availability.
   - Use the Azure SDK for Python to programmatically create and manage alerts. Here's an example script:

   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

   # Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

   # Create a MonitorManagementClient
   monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

   # Define the alert rule parameters
   alert_rule_params = {
       'location': 'eastus',
       'name': 'High CPU Alert',
       'description': 'Alert triggered when CPU usage exceeds 80%',
       'severity': 2,
       'enabled': True,
       'condition': {
           'odata.type': 'Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.ThresholdRuleCondition',
           'dataSource': {
               'odata.type': 'Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.RuleMetricDataSource',
               'resourceUri': '/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{web_service_name}',
               'metricName': 'CpuPercentage',
               'operator': 'GreaterThan',
               'threshold': 80
           }
       },
       'actions': [
           {
               'odata.type': 'Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.RuleEmailAction',
               'sendToServiceOwners': True
           }
       ]
   }

   # Create the alert rule
   monitor_client.alert_rules.create_or_update(
       resource_group_name,
       web_service_name,
       alert_rule_name,
       alert_rule_params
   )
   ```

2. Security and Compliance:
   - Implement Azure Security Center to continuously monitor the security posture of your Azure Web Service.
   - Enable Azure Security Center's Just-In-Time (JIT) VM Access feature to restrict access to your virtual machines.
   - Use the Azure SDK for Python to programmatically enable JIT VM Access. Here's an example script:

   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenterManagementClient
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

   # Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

   # Create a SecurityCenterManagementClient
   security_center_client = SecurityCenterManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

   # Enable JIT VM Access for the web service's virtual machines
   security_center_client.jit_network_access_policies.create_or_update(
       resource_group_name,
       web_service_name,
       'default',
       {
           'location': 'eastus',
           'virtualMachines': [
               {
                   'id': '/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vm_name}',
                   'ports': [
                       {
                           'number': 22,
                           'protocol': 'Tcp',
                           'allowedSourceAddressPrefixes': ['0.0.0.0/0']
                       }
                   ]
               }
           ]
       }
   )
   ```

3. Cost Optimization:
   - Utilize Azure Cost Management and Billing to monitor and optimize the costs of your Azure Web Service.
   - Enable cost alerts to receive notifications when your spending exceeds a certain threshold.
   - Use the Azure SDK for Python to programmatically create cost alerts. Here's an example script:

   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.costmanagement import CostManagementClient
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

   # Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

   # Create a CostManagementClient
   cost_management_client = CostManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

   # Define the cost alert parameters
   cost_alert_params = {
       'name': 'High Cost Alert',
       'description': 'Alert triggered when monthly spending exceeds $1000',
       'enabled': True,
       'threshold': 1000,
       'time_grain': 'Monthly',
       'time_window': 'PT1H',
       'query': "cost > 1000"
   }

   # Create the cost alert
   cost_management_client.alerts.create_or_update(
       resource_group_name,
       'default',
       cost_alert_params
   )
   ```
