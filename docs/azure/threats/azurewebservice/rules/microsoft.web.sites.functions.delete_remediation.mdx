### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The `microsoft.web.sites.functions.delete` event in Azure is triggered when a function app is deleted in Azure Web Apps.
- This event indicates that a specific function app within the Azure Web Apps service has been deleted.
- It is important to note that this event does not refer to the deletion of the entire Azure Web Apps service, but rather the removal of a specific function app within it.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with `microsoft.web.sites.functions.delete` in Azure for Azure Web Service, it means that the ability to delete functions within the web service is compromised. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or modification of critical functions.

To remediate this issue for Azure Web Service using the Azure console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) using your Azure account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Azure Web Service that is affected by the security issue.
3. Click on the "Functions" option in the left-hand menu to access the list of functions within the web service.
4. Select the function that you want to secure and click on its name to open the function details.
5. In the function details page, click on the "Platform features" tab.
6. Under the "Management" section, click on "Function app settings".
7. In the function app settings page, scroll down to the "Function app permissions" section.
8. Review the permissions assigned to the function app and ensure that the `microsoft.web.sites.functions.delete` permission is only granted to authorized users or roles.
9. If the permission is assigned to unauthorized users or roles, click on the "Access control (IAM)" option in the left-hand menu.
10. In the access control page, select the unauthorized user or role and click on the "Remove" button to revoke their access.
11. Repeat steps 9 and 10 for any other unauthorized users or roles that have the `microsoft.web.sites.functions.delete` permission.
12. Once you have removed the unauthorized access, click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you can remediate the security impact of `microsoft.web.sites.functions.delete` in Azure for Azure Web Service and ensure that only authorized users or roles have the ability to delete functions within the web service.

#### Using CLI

1. Example of security impact: When the `microsoft.web/sites/functions/delete` event is triggered in Azure for the Azure Web Service, it indicates that a function within the web app has been deleted. This can potentially impact security if the deleted function was responsible for handling sensitive data or performing critical security-related tasks.

2. Remediation using Azure CLI: To remediate this security impact for Azure Web Service using Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

   - Step 1: Identify the deleted function: Use the Azure CLI command `az functionapp function list` to list all the functions within the web app. Look for the deleted function in the output.

   - Step 2: Restore the deleted function: If the deleted function is critical for security, you can restore it using the Azure CLI command `az functionapp function restore`. Provide the necessary parameters such as the function name and the target web app.

   - Step 3: Validate the restoration: After restoring the function, verify its presence using the Azure CLI command `az functionapp function show`. Ensure that the function is successfully restored and functioning as expected.

Please note that the exact CLI commands may vary depending on your specific Azure environment and configuration. Make sure to refer to the Azure CLI documentation for the most up-to-date commands and parameters.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with `microsoft.web/sites/functions/delete` in Azure Web Service:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the `microsoft.web/sites/functions/delete` action in Azure Web Service, they can delete the functions associated with the web service. This can lead to disruption of service, loss of data, and potential security breaches.

2. Remediation for Azure Web Service using Python:
   - To remediate this security issue, you can use the Azure SDK for Python to implement access control and restrict the permissions for the `microsoft.web/sites/functions/delete` action. Here's an example Python script using the `azure-mgmt-web` library:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient

# Authenticate using default credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Specify your Azure subscription ID and resource group name
subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
resource_group_name = 'your_resource_group_name'

# Specify the name of your Azure Web Service
web_service_name = 'your_web_service_name'

# Create the WebSiteManagementClient
web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Get the existing role assignments for the web service
role_assignments = web_client.web_apps.list_function_app_publishing_credentials(
    resource_group_name, web_service_name
)

# Remove the 'microsoft.web/sites/functions/delete' permission from all role assignments
for role_assignment in role_assignments:
    if 'microsoft.web/sites/functions/delete' in role_assignment.actions:
        role_assignment.actions.remove('microsoft.web/sites/functions/delete')
        web_client.web_apps.update_function_app_publishing_credentials(
            resource_group_name, web_service_name, role_assignment
        )

print('Security remediation completed successfully.')
```

Please note that you need to install the required Python packages (`azure-identity` and `azure-mgmt-web`) before running this script.
