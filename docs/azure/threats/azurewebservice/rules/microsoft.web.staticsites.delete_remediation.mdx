### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Web.staticSites.Delete event in Azure Realtime for Azure Web Service refers to the deletion of a static site in Azure.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process initiates the deletion of a static site hosted in Azure.
- It indicates that the static site and all its associated resources, such as storage containers and CDN endpoints, will be permanently removed from the Azure environment.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Microsoft.Web.staticSites.Delete event in Azure, they could potentially delete a static website hosted on Azure Web Service. This could result in the loss of critical data, disruption of services, and potential damage to the organization's reputation.

Remediation:
- Enable Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to ensure that only authorized users have access to the Microsoft.Web.staticSites.Delete event. This will help prevent unauthorized deletion of static websites.
- Implement Azure Resource Locks to prevent accidental deletion of critical resources. By applying a lock at the resource group or resource level, you can prevent any modifications or deletions until the lock is removed.

Example CLI command to enable RBAC for the event:
```
az role assignment create --role "Contributor" --assignee <user or group principal ID> --scope /subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Web/staticSites/<static site name>/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/<event grid topic name>
```

Example CLI command to apply a resource lock:
```
az lock create --name <lock name> --lock-type CanNotDelete --resource-group <resource group name> --resource <resource name>
```

2. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.Web.staticSites.Delete event is triggered without proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in place, an attacker could potentially delete static websites without any restrictions. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, disruption of services, and potential financial losses.

Remediation:
- Implement Azure AD authentication for the Microsoft.Web.staticSites.Delete event. This ensures that only authenticated users with the necessary permissions can trigger the event.
- Enable Azure Event Grid system-managed identity and configure role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to the event. This helps prevent unauthorized deletion of static websites.

Example CLI command to enable Azure AD authentication for the event:
```
az webapp auth update --name <web app name> --resource-group <resource group name> --enabled true --action LoginWithAzureActiveDirectory
```

Example CLI command to enable system-managed identity and configure RBAC:
```
az webapp identity assign --name <web app name> --resource-group <resource group name>
az role assignment create --role "Contributor" --assignee <user or group principal ID> --scope /subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Web/staticSites/<static site name>/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/<event grid topic name>
```

3. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.Web.staticSites.Delete event is triggered by a malicious insider, they could delete critical static websites without leaving any trace. This could result in data loss, service disruption, and potential legal and compliance issues.

Remediation:
- Implement Azure Monitor to monitor and alert on any suspicious activities related to the Microsoft.Web.staticSites.Delete event. This helps detect and respond to any unauthorized deletions in real-time.
- Enable Azure Event Grid event delivery to Azure Storage or Azure Event Hubs for auditing purposes. This ensures that all events related to static website deletions are logged and can be used for forensic analysis if needed.

Example CLI command to enable Azure Monitor alerts for the event:
```
az monitor metrics alert create --name <alert name> --resource-group <resource group name> --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Web/staticSites/<static site name>/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/<event grid topic name> --condition "avg([Microsoft.EventGrid.Topics/EventsReceived]) > 0" --action-groups <action group name>
```

Example CLI command to enable event delivery to Azure Storage:
```
az eventgrid event-subscription create --name <subscription name> --source-resource-id /subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Web/staticSites/<static site name>/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/<event grid topic name> --endpoint-type storagequeue --endpoint <storage account ID>/queueservices/default/queues/<queue name>
```
