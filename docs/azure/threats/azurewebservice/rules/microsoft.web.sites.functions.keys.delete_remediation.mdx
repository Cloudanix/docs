### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The `microsoft.web.sites.functions.keys.delete` event in Azure Realtime for Azure Web Service refers to the deletion of a key associated with a function in an Azure Function App.
- This event indicates that a specific key used for authentication or authorization purposes has been deleted for a particular function within the Function App.
- It is important to monitor this event as it can help track any changes or potential security risks related to the keys used for accessing and securing Azure Functions.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: 
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the Azure Web Service and triggers the `microsoft.web.sites.functions.keys.delete` event, they can delete the keys associated with the Azure Functions within the web service. This can lead to a potential security breach as the keys are used for authentication and authorization purposes.

2. Remediation:
   - Enable Azure Active Directory authentication for the Azure Web Service to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the keys.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to the Azure Web Service and its associated resources.
   - Regularly monitor and review the audit logs and activity logs for any suspicious activities related to the `microsoft.web.sites.functions.keys.delete` event.

Example CLI command to enable Azure Active Directory authentication for an Azure Web Service:
```
az webapp auth update --name <webapp_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --enabled true --action LoginWithAzureActiveDirectory
```

Example CLI command to assign RBAC roles to restrict access to an Azure Web Service:
```
az role assignment create --assignee <user_or_group_object_id> --role <role_name> --scope /subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group_name>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<webapp_name>
```

Note: Replace the placeholders (`<webapp_name>`, `<resource_group_name>`, `<user_or_group_object_id>`, `<role_name>`, `<subscription_id>`) with the actual values specific to your Azure environment.
