### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The "microsoft.web.sites.functions.keys.delete" event in Azure is triggered when a key associated with an Azure Function App is deleted.
2. This event indicates that a specific key used for authentication or authorization purposes within the Azure Function App has been removed.
3. It is important to monitor this event as it can help track any changes made to the keys and ensure the security and integrity of the Azure Function App.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- The security impact of using the `microsoft.web.sites.functions.keys.delete` action in Azure Functions is that it allows the deletion of keys associated with the Azure Web Service. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access or disruption of the service.
- An example scenario could be an attacker gaining access to the Azure Functions management console and using the `microsoft.web.sites.functions.keys.delete` action to delete the keys, thereby denying legitimate access to the Azure Web Service.

To remediate this security issue for Azure Web Service using the Azure console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) using your Azure account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Azure Web Service that you want to secure.
3. In the left-hand menu, under the "Settings" section, click on "Functions".
4. Select the specific Azure Function that you want to secure.
5. In the Function's overview page, click on the "Manage" tab.
6. Under the "Keys" section, you will see a list of keys associated with the Azure Function.
7. Identify the key that has the `microsoft.web.sites.functions.keys.delete` action assigned to it.
8. Click on the "..." (ellipsis) button next to the key and select "Regenerate" from the dropdown menu.
9. A confirmation dialog will appear, asking you to confirm the key regeneration. Click on "Yes" to proceed.
10. The key will be regenerated, and the old key will no longer be valid for performing the `microsoft.web.sites.functions.keys.delete` action.

By regenerating the key associated with the `microsoft.web.sites.functions.keys.delete` action, you effectively revoke the access to delete keys for the Azure Web Service, mitigating the security impact.

#### Using CLI

1. Example of security impact: The `microsoft.web.sites.functions.keys.delete` action in Azure Functions allows a user to delete a function key associated with an Azure Web Service. If an unauthorized user gains access to this action, they can delete function keys, potentially disrupting the functionality of the Azure Web Service and compromising its security.

2. Remediation using Azure CLI: To remediate this security issue for an Azure Web Service in Azure Functions, you can follow these steps using Azure CLI:

   - Step 1: Install Azure CLI if not already installed.
   - Step 2: Open the Azure CLI command prompt or terminal.
   - Step 3: Authenticate with your Azure account using the `az login` command.
   - Step 4: Set the target Azure subscription using the `az account set --subscription <subscription_id>` command, replacing `<subscription_id>` with the actual subscription ID.
   - Step 5: Disable the `microsoft.web.sites.functions.keys.delete` action for the Azure Web Service by running the following command:
     ```
     az webapp auth update --name <web_app_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --enabled false
     ```
     Replace `<web_app_name>` with the name of the Azure Web Service and `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group it belongs to.

3. Verify the remediation: After executing the above command, the `microsoft.web.sites.functions.keys.delete` action will be disabled for the Azure Web Service. You can verify this by attempting to delete a function key using the Azure portal or any other method. The action should no longer be allowed, ensuring the security of the Azure Web Service.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with `microsoft.web.sites.functions.keys.delete` in Azure Web Service:
   - The `microsoft.web.sites.functions.keys.delete` action allows a user to delete the keys associated with Azure Functions in an Azure Web Service. If an unauthorized user gains access to this action, they can delete the keys, potentially disrupting the functionality of the Azure Functions and compromising the security of the application.

2. Remediation for Azure Web Service using Python:
   - To remediate this security issue for Azure Web Service, you can use the Azure SDK for Python to manage access control and permissions. Here's an example Python script to revoke the `microsoft.web.sites.functions.keys.delete` permission for a specific user or service principal:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.authorization import AuthorizationManagementClient

# Set your Azure subscription ID and resource group name
subscription_id = '<your-subscription-id>'
resource_group_name = '<your-resource-group-name>'

# Set the name of your Azure Web Service
web_service_name = '<your-web-service-name>'

# Set the user or service principal object ID for which you want to revoke the permission
object_id = '<user-or-service-principal-object-id>'

# Create the authorization management client
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
authorization_client = AuthorizationManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Revoke the permission for the specified user or service principal
permission_name = 'microsoft.web/servers/functions/keys/delete'
scope = f'/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group_name}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{web_service_name}'
authorization_client.role_assignments.delete(scope, object_id, permission_name)
```

3. Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to manage access control in Azure. You may need to authenticate using a service principal or a user account with appropriate privileges.
