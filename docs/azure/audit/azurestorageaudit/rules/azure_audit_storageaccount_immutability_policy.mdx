### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal using your credentials.

2. Navigate to the Storage Accounts section. Here, you will see a list of all the storage accounts associated with your Azure subscription.

3. Select the storage account you want to check for the Immutable Blob Storage configuration.

4. In the storage account window, scroll down to the 'Blob service' section in the left-hand menu. Click on 'Data Protection'.

5. In the Data Protection window, check the 'Immutable Blob Storage' section. If it is enabled, you will see the policies listed under it. If it is not enabled, the section will be empty.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI commands, you need to have the Azure CLI installed on your system. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website.

2. Login to Azure: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be prompted to enter your username and password.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, select the subscription where the storage account resides.
   ```
   az account set --subscription "Your Subscription Name"
   ```
4. Check Immutable Blob Storage: Use the following command to check the status of Immutable Blob Storage. Replace 'YourResourceGroup' and 'YourStorageAccount' with your actual resource group and storage account names.
   ```
   az storage account blob-service-properties show --name YourStorageAccount --resource-group YourResourceGroup --query 'immutableStoragePolicy'
   ```
   If the output is null, it means that the Immutable Blob Storage is not enabled. If it shows a policy, it means that the Immutable Blob Storage is enabled.

#### Using Python

Immutable Blob Storage is a feature of Azure Storage Service. It allows you to store business-critical data objects in a WORM (Write Once, Read Many) state. This helps to ensure that the data cannot be modified or deleted by any user, even if they have permission to do so.

Here are the steps to detect if Immutable Blob Storage is enabled using Python scripts:

1. Install Azure SDK: Azure SDK is required to interact with Azure services. You can install it using pip.

```python
pip install azure-storage-blob
```

2. Import Required Libraries: Import the necessary libraries in your Python script.

```python
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
```

3. Create a BlobServiceClient: You need to create a BlobServiceClient object by providing the connection string. This object allows you to interact with the Blob storage service.

```python
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string("your_connection_string")
```

4. Check for Immutable Blob Storage: Now, you can use the `get_container_properties` method to get the properties of a container. If the `has_immutability_policy` property is True, then Immutable Blob Storage is enabled.

```python
container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client("your_container_name")
properties = container_client.get_container_properties()
if properties.has_immutability_policy:
    print("Immutable Blob Storage is enabled.")
else:
    print("Immutable Blob Storage is not enabled.")
```

Please replace "your_connection_string" and "your_container_name" with your actual Azure Blob Storage connection string and container name.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling Immutable Blob Storage in Azure, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Navigate to the Storage Account where you want to enable Immutable Blob Storage.
3. Click on the "Configuration" tab from the left-hand side menu.
4. Scroll down to the "Data Protection" section and click on the "Immutability policies" option.
5. Click on the "+ Add" button to create a new Immutability policy.
6. In the "Create Immutability Policy" blade, provide the following details:
   - Name: A unique name for the policy
   - Description: A brief description of the policy
   - Immutability Period: The number of days for which the blobs should be kept immutable
   - Allow Permanently Delete: Whether to allow permanently deleting the blobs during the immutability period
   - Allow Rehydrate: Whether to allow rehydrating the blobs during the immutability period
7. Click on the "Review + create" button to review the policy details.
8. Once you have reviewed the details, click on the "Create" button to create the Immutability policy.

With these steps, you have successfully enabled Immutable Blob Storage in Azure for the selected Storage Account.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Enable Immutable Blob Storage" misconfiguration for Azure using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI on your computer.

2. Log in to your Azure account using the following command:

   ```
   az login
   ```

3. Once you are logged in, select the Azure subscription that contains the storage account that you want to remediate using the following command:

   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
   ```

4. Get the resource ID of the storage account that you want to remediate using the following command:

   ```
   az storage account show --name <storage_account_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --query id --output tsv
   ```

5. Enable the immutable blob storage for the storage account using the following command:

   ```
   az storage account update --name <storage_account_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --set properties.supportsHttpsTrafficOnly=true properties.preventEncryptionScopeOverride=true
   ```

   This command sets the "supportsHttpsTrafficOnly" and "preventEncryptionScopeOverride" properties to "true", which enables immutable blob storage.

6. Verify that the immutable blob storage has been enabled for the storage account by running the following command:

   ```
   az storage account show --name <storage_account_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --query properties.supportsHttpsTrafficOnly
   ```

   If the command returns "true", then immutable blob storage has been enabled successfully.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the "Enable Immutable Blob Storage" misconfiguration for Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Enable Immutable Blob Storage" in Azure using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Azure Blob Storage SDK for Python by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install azure-storage-blob
```

2. Import the necessary modules:

```
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient, BlobClient, ContainerClient, __version__
```

3. Authenticate with your Azure account by providing the connection string. You can obtain the connection string from the Azure Portal, under the "Access keys" section of your storage account.

```
connect_str = '<your_connection_string>'
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(connect_str)
```

4. Choose the container that you want to enable immutable blob storage for:

```
container_name = '<your_container_name>'
container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(container_name)
```

5. Set the immutable policy on the container:

```
retention_days = 365
container_client.set_immutable_policy(immutability_period_in_days=retention_days)
```

This will enable immutable blob storage on the specified container for the specified retention period. Any attempt to modify or delete a blob within this period will result in an error. 

Note: Immutable blob storage is only available for the Azure Blob Storage tier, not for the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 tier.
