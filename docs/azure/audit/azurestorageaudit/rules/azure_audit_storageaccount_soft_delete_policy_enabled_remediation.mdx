To remediate the misconfiguration of not having Soft Delete enabled for Azure Blob Storage, you can follow the below steps using the Azure console:

1. Open the Azure portal and navigate to the storage account that needs to be updated.

2. Click on the "Configuration" tab in the left-hand menu.

3. Scroll down to the "Blob service" section and click on "Data protection".

4. Under "Soft delete", toggle the switch to "Enabled".

5. Set the "Retention period" to the desired number of days for which you want to retain the deleted data.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To enable Soft Delete for Azure Blob Storage using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open Azure CLI on your local machine or use the Azure Cloud Shell.
2. Login to your Azure account using the following command:
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. Once you are logged in, set the subscription where the storage account is located using the following command:
   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
   ```
   Replace `<subscription_id>` with the ID of your subscription.
4. Next, get the resource ID of the storage account for which you want to enable Soft Delete using the following command:
   ```
   az storage account show -n <storage_account_name> -g <resource_group_name> --query id --output tsv
   ```
   Replace `<storage_account_name>` with the name of your storage account and `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group where the storage account is located.
5. Once you have the resource ID, enable Soft Delete for the storage account using the following command:
   ```
   az resource update --ids <resource_id> --set properties.enableSoftDelete=true
   ```
   Replace `<resource_id>` with the resource ID you obtained in step 4.
6. Verify that Soft Delete has been enabled by running the following command:
   ```
   az storage account show -n <storage_account_name> -g <resource_group_name> --query properties.enableSoftDelete
   ```
   Replace `<storage_account_name>` with the name of your storage account and `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group where the storage account is located.

That's it! Soft Delete has been enabled for your Azure Blob Storage.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To enable soft delete for Azure Blob Storage using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient, BlobSasPermissions, generate_blob_sas
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

2. Set up the connection to your Azure Blob Storage account:

```python
connection_string = "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<your_account_name>;AccountKey=<your_account_key>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)
```

3. Retrieve the Blob Container for which you want to enable soft delete:

```python
container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client("<your_container_name>")
```

4. Check if the container has soft delete enabled:

```python
properties = container_client.get_container_properties()
if not properties.is_deleted_enabled:
    # Enable soft delete
    container_client.set_container_properties(deleted_retention_days=7, is_deleted_enabled=True)
```

5. Save the changes:

```python
container_client.set_container_metadata(metadata={"SoftDeleteEnabled": "True"})
```

6. Verify that soft delete is enabled:

```python
properties = container_client.get_container_properties()
if properties.is_deleted_enabled:
    print("Soft delete is enabled.")
else:
    print("Soft delete is not enabled.")
```

Note: Replace `<your_account_name>` and `<your_account_key>` with your Azure Blob Storage account name and account key, respectively. Also, replace `<your_container_name>` with the name of the container for which you want to enable soft delete.
