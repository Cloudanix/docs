title: Access Keys Not Rotated
---

### More Info:

When a storage account is created, Azure generates two 512-bit storage access keys, which are used for authentication when the storage account is accessed. Rotating these keys periodically ensures that any inadvertent access or exposure does not result in these keys being compromised. The access keys storage accounts should be rotated at least every 90 days.
