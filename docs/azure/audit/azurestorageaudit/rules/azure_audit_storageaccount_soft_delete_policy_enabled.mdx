### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using your Azure account credentials.

2. In the left-hand menu, navigate to "Storage accounts". This will display a list of all the storage accounts associated with your Azure subscription.

3. Select the storage account for which you want to check the Soft Delete configuration. This will open the storage account's dashboard.

4. In the storage account's dashboard, under the "Blob service" section, click on "Data protection". Here, you can see the status of the Soft Delete feature. If it's enabled, you will see it marked as "Enabled". If not, it will be marked as "Disabled".

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal.

2. Login to Azure: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be redirected to the browser for login. Enter your credentials and login.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, select the one where the blob storage is located. Replace 'my-subscription-name' with your actual subscription name.
   ```
   az account set --subscription 'my-subscription-name'
   ```
4. Check Soft Delete Status: Now, use the following command to check the status of Soft Delete for your Blob Storage. Replace 'my-resource-group' and 'mystorageaccount' with your actual resource group and storage account names.
   ```
   az storage blob service-properties delete-policy show --account-name mystorageaccount --resource-group my-resource-group
   ```
   This command will return the status of the Soft Delete policy. If it's enabled, it will return 'true'. If it's not enabled, it will return 'false'.

#### Using Python

1. Install Azure SDK: To interact with Azure services, you need to install Azure SDK in your Python environment. You can do this by running the command `pip install azure-storage-blob`.

2. Import Required Libraries: Import the necessary libraries in your Python script. You will need the `BlobServiceClient` from `azure.storage.blob` to interact with the Blob storage.

```python
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
```

3. Create BlobServiceClient: Create an instance of `BlobServiceClient` using your storage account connection string. This connection string contains the information required to connect to your storage account.

```python
connection_string = "your_connection_string"
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)
```

4. Check Soft Delete Policy: Now, you can check the soft delete policy of your Blob storage. If the `delete_retention_policy` is enabled and the `delete_retention_days` is not None, then the soft delete is enabled.

```python
service_properties = blob_service_client.get_service_properties()
soft_delete_enabled = service_properties.delete_retention_policy.enabled
soft_delete_days = service_properties.delete_retention_policy.days

if soft_delete_enabled and soft_delete_days is not None:
    print("Soft delete is enabled.")
else:
    print("Soft delete is not enabled.")
```

This script will print whether the soft delete is enabled or not for the Blob storage.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not having Soft Delete enabled for Azure Blob Storage, you can follow the below steps using the Azure console:

1. Open the Azure portal and navigate to the storage account that needs to be updated.

2. Click on the "Configuration" tab in the left-hand menu.

3. Scroll down to the "Blob service" section and click on "Data protection".

4. Under "Soft delete", toggle the switch to "Enabled".

5. Set the "Retention period" to the desired number of days for which you want to retain the deleted data.

6. Click on "Save" to apply the changes.

After following these steps, Soft Delete will be enabled for your Azure Blob Storage and any deleted data will be retained for the specified retention period.

#### Using CLI

To enable Soft Delete for Azure Blob Storage using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open Azure CLI on your local machine or use the Azure Cloud Shell.
2. Login to your Azure account using the following command:
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. Once you are logged in, set the subscription where the storage account is located using the following command:
   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
   ```
   Replace `<subscription_id>` with the ID of your subscription.
4. Next, get the resource ID of the storage account for which you want to enable Soft Delete using the following command:
   ```
   az storage account show -n <storage_account_name> -g <resource_group_name> --query id --output tsv
   ```
   Replace `<storage_account_name>` with the name of your storage account and `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group where the storage account is located.
5. Once you have the resource ID, enable Soft Delete for the storage account using the following command:
   ```
   az resource update --ids <resource_id> --set properties.enableSoftDelete=true
   ```
   Replace `<resource_id>` with the resource ID you obtained in step 4.
6. Verify that Soft Delete has been enabled by running the following command:
   ```
   az storage account show -n <storage_account_name> -g <resource_group_name> --query properties.enableSoftDelete
   ```
   Replace `<storage_account_name>` with the name of your storage account and `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group where the storage account is located.

That's it! Soft Delete has been enabled for your Azure Blob Storage.

#### Using Python

To enable soft delete for Azure Blob Storage using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient, BlobSasPermissions, generate_blob_sas
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

2. Set up the connection to your Azure Blob Storage account:

```python
connection_string = "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<your_account_name>;AccountKey=<your_account_key>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)
```

3. Retrieve the Blob Container for which you want to enable soft delete:

```python
container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client("<your_container_name>")
```

4. Check if the container has soft delete enabled:

```python
properties = container_client.get_container_properties()
if not properties.is_deleted_enabled:
    # Enable soft delete
    container_client.set_container_properties(deleted_retention_days=7, is_deleted_enabled=True)
```

5. Save the changes:

```python
container_client.set_container_metadata(metadata={"SoftDeleteEnabled": "True"})
```

6. Verify that soft delete is enabled:

```python
properties = container_client.get_container_properties()
if properties.is_deleted_enabled:
    print("Soft delete is enabled.")
else:
    print("Soft delete is not enabled.")
```

Note: Replace `<your_account_name>` and `<your_account_key>` with your Azure Blob Storage account name and account key, respectively. Also, replace `<your_container_name>` with the name of the container for which you want to enable soft delete.
