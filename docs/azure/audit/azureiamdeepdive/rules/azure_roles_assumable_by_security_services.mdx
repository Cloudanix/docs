### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of roles assumable by security services in AWS IAM using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the IAM console.
3. In the navigation pane, choose "Roles".
4. Review the list of roles and identify the roles that are assumable by security services, such as AWS Security Hub, AWS Config, or AWS CloudTrail.
5. Select the role that you want to remediate.
6. Choose the "Trust relationships" tab.
7. Under "Trusted entities", locate the security service that should not have the ability to assume the role.
8. Select the security service entry.
9. Choose the "Remove" button to remove the trust relationship with the security service.
10. Review the changes and confirm the removal of the trust relationship.
11. Repeat steps 5-10 for all roles that are assumable by security services.
12. Once all the necessary changes are made, save the changes.

By following these steps, you will remediate the misconfiguration of roles assumable by security services in AWS IAM using the AWS Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Roles Assumable By Security Services" in AWS IAM using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Install and configure Azure CLI: 
   - Install Azure CLI by following the instructions provided in the official documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
   - Configure Azure CLI by running the `az login` command and following the authentication process.

2. Identify the misconfigured roles: 
   - Use the `az role assignment list` command to list all the role assignments in your Azure subscription: 
     ```
     az role assignment list --all
     ```

3. Identify security services roles:
   - Look for role assignments related to security services such as Azure Security Center, Azure Sentinel, or Azure Defender. These roles typically have names indicating their association with security services.

4. Remove the misconfigured roles:
   - Use the `az role assignment delete` command to remove the misconfigured role assignments. Replace `<role-assignment-id>` with the ID of the specific role assignment you want to remove:
     ```
     az role assignment delete --ids <role-assignment-id>
     ```

5. Repeat step 4 for all misconfigured roles:
   - Execute step 4 for each misconfigured role assignment related to security services that you identified in step 3.

6. Verify the remediation:
   - Use the `az role assignment list` command again to ensure that the misconfigured roles have been successfully removed:
     ```
     az role assignment list --all
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration "Roles Assumable By Security Services" in AWS IAM using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of "Roles Assumable By Security Services" in AWS IAM using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the IAM roles that are assumable by security services. These roles are typically associated with services like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS Security Token Service (STS), or AWS Config.

2. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to programmatically modify the IAM roles and update their trust policies. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to modify IAM roles.

3. Create a Python script and import the required libraries:

```python
import boto3
```

4. Initialize the AWS IAM client:

```python
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
```

5. Use the `list_roles` method to retrieve the list of IAM roles:

```python
response = iam_client.list_roles()
roles = response['Roles']
```

6. Iterate through the roles and check if any of them have a trust policy allowing assumption by security services:

```python
for role in roles:
    role_name = role['RoleName']
    assume_role_policy = role['AssumeRolePolicyDocument']
    
    # Check if the trust policy allows assumption by security services
    # Modify this condition based on your specific requirements
    if 'Service' in assume_role_policy['Statement'][0]['Principal']:
        print(f"Role '{role_name}' is assumable by security services.")
        # Remediation steps go here
```

7. For each role that is assumable by security services, you can modify the trust policy to restrict assumption only to trusted entities. Here's an example of how to update the trust policy to allow assumption only by specific AWS accounts:

```python
# Define the updated trust policy
updated_trust_policy = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"  # Replace with trusted AWS account ID
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}

# Update the trust policy for the role
iam_client.update_assume_role_policy(RoleName=role_name, PolicyDocument=json.dumps(updated_trust_policy))
```

8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 for all the roles that are assumable by security services.

Note: Make sure to update the trust policy according to your specific requirements and replace the placeholder AWS account ID with the trusted account ID.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of "Roles Assumable By Security Services" in AWS IAM using Python.
