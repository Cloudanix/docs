#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Roles Assumable By Database Services" in AWS IAM using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the IAM console.
3. In the navigation pane, choose "Roles".
4. Search and select the role that is assumable by database services.
5. Click on the "Trust relationships" tab.
6. Locate the "Policy Document" section and click on the "Edit trust relationship" button.
7. Update the trust policy document to restrict the permissions for the role to only allow trusted entities to assume the role.

Here is an example of a trust policy document that allows only specific services to assume the role:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": [
          "rds.amazonaws.com",
          "redshift.amazonaws.com",
          "docdb.amazonaws.com",
          "neptune.amazonaws.com",
          "dms.amazonaws.com",
          "glue.amazonaws.com",
          "quicksight.amazonaws.com",
          "athena.amazonaws.com"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

8. Replace the existing trust policy document with the updated one.
9. Review the changes and click on the "Update Trust Policy" button to save the changes.

By following these steps, you have remediated the misconfiguration "Roles Assumable By Database Services" in AWS IAM using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Roles Assumable By Database Services" in AWS IAM using the Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Install and configure the Azure CLI: 
   - Install the Azure CLI by following the instructions provided at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli.
   - After installation, run `az login` to sign in to your Azure account and authenticate with the Azure CLI.

2. Identify the affected roles:
   - Run the following command to list all the roles in your Azure subscription:
     ```
     az role definition list --query "[?contains(roleName, 'Database')].{Name: roleName, Id: name}" -o table
     ```
   - Identify the roles that are assumable by database services.

3. Update the role assignments:
   - Run the following command to list all the role assignments in your Azure subscription:
     ```
     az role assignment list --all -o table
     ```
   - Identify the role assignments that are assumable by database services.
   - For each role assignment that needs to be remediated, run the following command to remove the assignment:
     ```
     az role assignment delete --assignee <assignee-id> --role <role-id>
     ```
     Replace `<assignee-id>` with the ID of the assignee (user, group, or service principal) and `<role-id>` with the ID of the role that needs to be removed.

4. Verify the remediation:
   - Run the following command to list the role assignments again:
     ```
     az role assignment list --all -o table
     ```
   - Ensure that the role assignments that were previously assumable by database services are no longer present.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Roles Assumable By Database Services" in AWS IAM using the Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Roles Assumable By Database Services" in AWS IAM using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected IAM roles: Determine which IAM roles are currently assumable by database services. These roles can be identified by checking their trust policies.

2. Update the trust policy of IAM roles: Modify the trust policy of each affected IAM role to limit the services that can assume the role. The trust policy should only allow specific database services or required entities to assume the role.

   a. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to get the existing trust policy of an IAM role.
   
   ```python
   import boto3

   iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
   role_name = 'your-role-name'

   response = iam_client.get_role(RoleName=role_name)
   trust_policy = response['Role']['AssumeRolePolicyDocument']
   ```
   
   b. Update the trust policy to allow only specific database services or entities to assume the role. Modify the `Statement` section of the policy document accordingly. For example, if you want to allow only Amazon RDS to assume the role, the trust policy would look like this:
   
   ```python
   trust_policy['Statement'][0]['Principal']['Service'] = 'rds.amazonaws.com'
   ```
   
   c. Set the updated trust policy for the IAM role.
   
   ```python
   iam_client.update_assume_role_policy(
       RoleName=role_name,
       PolicyDocument=json.dumps(trust_policy)
   )
   ```

3. Repeat step 2 for all affected IAM roles: Iterate through all the affected IAM roles and perform the trust policy update for each role.

4. Verify the remediation: After updating the trust policies of the IAM roles, verify that only the intended database services or entities can assume the roles.

Note: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify IAM roles and access the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) before attempting these steps.
