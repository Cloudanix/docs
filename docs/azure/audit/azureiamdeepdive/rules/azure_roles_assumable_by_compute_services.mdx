### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of roles assumable by compute services in AWS IAM using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the IAM console.
3. In the navigation pane, select "Roles".
4. Review the list of roles and identify the roles that are assumable by compute services.
5. Select the role that you want to modify.
6. In the "Permissions" tab, click on "Edit trust relationship".
7. In the "Policy Document" section, modify the trust policy to restrict the assumable roles.
8. Update the "Principal" section of the trust policy to include only the specific compute services that should be allowed to assume the role. For example, if you want to allow only EC2 instances to assume the role, modify the principal section as follows:

```
"Principal": {
    "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
}
```

9. Click on "Update Trust Policy" to save the changes.
10. Repeat steps 5-9 for each role that allows assumable by compute services.

By following these steps, you will restrict the assumable roles for compute services in AWS IAM using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of roles assumable by compute services in AWS IAM using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Install and configure Azure CLI: 
   - Download and install Azure CLI from the official Microsoft website.
   - Open the command prompt or terminal and run the `az login` command to sign in to your Azure account.

2. List the existing roles in Azure:
   - Run the command `az role definition list` to retrieve a list of all the available roles in Azure.

3. Identify the roles assumable by compute services:
   - Review the list of roles obtained in the previous step and identify the roles that are assumable by compute services. These roles typically have "Compute" or "Virtual Machine" in their names.

4. Create a custom role with restricted permissions:
   - Run the command `az role definition create --role-definition <JSON_FILE_PATH>` to create a custom role definition using a JSON file.
   - Replace `<JSON_FILE_PATH>` with the path to a JSON file that defines the custom role with restricted permissions.
   - In the JSON file, specify the necessary permissions required by compute services, such as managing virtual machines, networks, or storage. Remove any unnecessary or excessive permissions.

5. Assign the custom role to the appropriate compute services:
   - Run the command `az role assignment create --assignee <SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID> --role <ROLE_NAME>` to assign the custom role to the appropriate compute services.
   - Replace `<SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID>` with the ID of the service principal associated with the compute service.
   - Replace `<ROLE_NAME>` with the name of the custom role created in the previous step.

6. Verify the role assignment:
   - Run the command `az role assignment list --assignee <SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID>` to verify that the custom role has been successfully assigned to the compute service.
   - Replace `<SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID>` with the ID of the service principal associated with the compute service.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 for all relevant compute services:
   - If there are multiple compute services in your Azure environment, repeat steps 4-6 for each service to ensure the roles assumable by compute services are properly configured.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of roles assumable by compute services in AWS IAM using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Roles Assumable By Compute Services" in AWS IAM using Python, follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected IAM roles: Determine which IAM roles have the "sts:AssumeRole" permission for the service principal associated with compute services (e.g., EC2, Lambda).

2. Update the IAM policy for each affected role: Modify the IAM policy attached to each affected role to restrict the "sts:AssumeRole" permission only to trusted entities. Here's an example of how to achieve this using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

def update_role_policy(role_name):
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

    try:
        # Get the current role policy
        response = iam_client.get_role_policy(
            RoleName=role_name,
            PolicyName='AssumeRolePolicy'
        )
        
        # Update the policy document to restrict the AssumeRole permission
        policy_document = response['PolicyDocument']
        policy_document['Statement'][0]['Principal']['Service'] = 'trusted-service-principal'
        
        # Update the role policy
        response = iam_client.update_role_policy(
            RoleName=role_name,
            PolicyName='AssumeRolePolicy',
            PolicyDocument=policy_document
        )
        
        print(f"Updated role policy for {role_name} successfully.")
    
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Failed to update role policy for {role_name}: {e}")

# Update the policy for each affected role
affected_roles = ['role1', 'role2', 'role3']
for role in affected_roles:
    update_role_policy(role)
```

Replace `'trusted-service-principal'` with the actual trusted service principal that should be allowed to assume the role. Repeat the `update_role_policy` function call for each affected role.

3. Verify the remediation: After updating the IAM policies, ensure that only the trusted compute services can assume the roles by testing the role assumption using the AWS Management Console or programmatically.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Roles Assumable By Compute Services" misconfiguration in AWS IAM using Python.
