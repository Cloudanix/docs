#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of inactive users in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the IAM console by selecting "Services" from the navigation bar at the top of the screen, and then selecting "IAM" under the "Security, Identity & Compliance" section.
3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Users" to view the list of IAM users.
4. Identify the inactive users by checking the "Last Activity" column. Users who have not performed any activity for a long time are considered inactive.
5. Select the inactive user(s) from the list by clicking the checkbox next to their names.
6. Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Delete users" to remove the inactive users.
7. A confirmation window will appear. Review the list of users to be deleted and click on the "Delete" button to proceed.
8. Repeat steps 5-7 for all the inactive users you identified.
9. Once the users are deleted, it is recommended to review and update the IAM policies and roles to ensure that the inactive users' permissions are no longer being used or assigned to any resources.

It is important to note that before deleting any user, you should ensure that the user is truly inactive and no longer required. You may want to check with the user or their manager to confirm their status before proceeding with the deletion.

#### Using CLI

To remediate inactive users in AWS IAM using Azure CLI, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Install Azure CLI: If you haven't already, install Azure CLI on your machine by following the instructions provided by Microsoft.

2. Authenticate with Azure CLI: Open your terminal and authenticate with Azure CLI using the command `az login`. Follow the prompts to complete the authentication process.

3. Switch to the Azure AD tenant: If you have multiple Azure AD tenants, switch to the appropriate tenant where your AWS IAM users are located. Use the command `az account set --subscription <subscription_id>` to switch to the desired subscription.

4. List all the users: To identify inactive users, you need to list all the users in the Azure AD tenant. Use the command `az ad user list` to retrieve a list of all the users.

5. Identify inactive users: Analyze the list of users and identify the inactive users based on your organization's policy or specific criteria. Inactive users are generally those who have not logged in for a specified period.

6. Disable inactive users: Once you have identified the inactive users, disable them to prevent further access. Use the command `az ad user update --id <user_objectId> --account-enabled false` to disable a specific user. Replace `<user_objectId>` with the Object ID of the inactive user.

7. Repeat step 6 for each inactive user: Iterate through all the identified inactive users and disable them using the command mentioned in step 6.

8. Verify the changes: To ensure that the inactive users are successfully disabled, you can list the users again using the command `az ad user list` and verify that the `accountEnabled` property is set to `false` for the previously inactive users.

By following these steps, you can remediate inactive users in AWS IAM using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate inactive users in AWS IAM using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the required libraries:
```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

2. Set up the AWS IAM client:
```python
client = boto3.client('iam')
```

3. Define the function to remediate inactive users:
```python
def remediate_inactive_users():
    # Get the current date and time
    current_time = datetime.now()

    # Define the threshold for inactivity (e.g., 90 days)
    threshold_days = 90

    # Calculate the date threshold
    threshold_date = current_time - timedelta(days=threshold_days)

    # List all IAM users
    response = client.list_users()

    # Iterate through each user
    for user in response['Users']:
        # Get the user's last activity
        response = client.get_user_last_accessed_time(UserName=user['UserName'])
        last_accessed_time = response['UserLastAccessed']['LastAccessedDateTime']

        # Check if the user has not been active after the threshold date
        if last_accessed_time < threshold_date:
            # Delete the user
            client.delete_user(UserName=user['UserName'])
            print(f"Deleted inactive user: {user['UserName']}")
```

4. Call the function to remediate inactive users:
```python
remediate_inactive_users()
```

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions and have configured your AWS credentials properly before running this code.
