#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of roles assumable by container services in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the IAM console.
3. In the navigation pane, click on "Roles".
4. Search for the role that is assumable by container services.
5. Select the role from the list to view its details.
6. Click on the "Trust relationships" tab.
7. Under "Trusted entities", you will find the container services that can assume this role.
8. Click on "Edit trust relationship" to modify the trust policy.
9. In the "Policy Document" section, you will see the JSON representation of the trust policy.
10. Update the trust policy to include only the necessary container services that require this role.
11. Remove any unnecessary container services from the trust policy.
12. Click on "Update Trust Policy" to save the changes.

By following these steps, you have remediated the misconfiguration of roles assumable by container services in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Roles Assumable By Container Services" in AWS IAM using Azure CLI, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Install the Azure CLI: 
   - Visit the Azure CLI installation page: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
   - Follow the instructions specific to your operating system to install the Azure CLI.

2. Authenticate with Azure CLI:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the command `az login` to initiate the authentication process.
   - Follow the instructions provided in the command output to complete the authentication.

3. List the container instances:
   - Run the command `az container list` to list all the container instances in your Azure subscription.
   - Identify the container instances for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

4. Update the role assignments:
   - Run the command `az role assignment create` to create a new role assignment for each container instance identified in the previous step.
   - Specify the `--scope` parameter with the resource ID of the container instance.
   - Specify the `--role` parameter with the appropriate role that you want to assign to the container instance.
   - Specify the `--assignee-object-id` parameter with the object ID of the service principal or user that should assume the role.
   - Repeat this command for each container instance that needs to be remediated.

5. Verify the remediation:
   - Run the command `az role assignment list` to list all the role assignments in your Azure subscription.
   - Ensure that the role assignments for the container instances have been successfully updated.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Roles Assumable By Container Services" in AWS IAM using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of assumable roles by container services in AWS IAM using Python, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python packages:
```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules in your Python script:
```python
import boto3
```

3. Create an AWS IAM client object:
```python
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
```

4. List all the roles in your AWS account:
```python
response = iam_client.list_roles()
roles = response['Roles']
```

5. Iterate through the roles and check if any of them have the `ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com` service principal:
```python
for role in roles:
    role_name = role['RoleName']
    response = iam_client.list_role_tags(RoleName=role_name)
    tags = response['Tags']
    for tag in tags:
        if tag['Key'] == 'aws:servicecatalog:provisioningPrincipalArn' and \
                'ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com' in tag['Value']:
            print(f"Role '{role_name}' has assumable permissions by container services.")
```

6. To remediate the issue, you can either remove the assumable permissions from the role or modify the trust policy to restrict access only to the required services. Here's an example of how to modify the trust policy to allow access only to the ECS service:
```python
trust_policy = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "ecs.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}

iam_client.update_assume_role_policy(RoleName=role_name, PolicyDocument=json.dumps(trust_policy))
```

Note: Make sure to replace `'ecs.amazonaws.com'` with the appropriate service principal for your use case.

By following these steps, you can identify the roles with assumable permissions by container services and remediate the misconfiguration in AWS IAM using Python.
