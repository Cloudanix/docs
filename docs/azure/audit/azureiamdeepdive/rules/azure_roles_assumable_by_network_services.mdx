#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Roles Assumable By Network Services" in AWS IAM using the Azure console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com).

2. Navigate to the Azure Active Directory (AD) service.

3. In the left-hand menu, click on "Enterprise applications."

4. Search for and select the AWS application associated with your AWS account.

5. In the application's overview page, click on "Properties" in the left-hand menu.

6. Under the "Application ID" section, note down the value of the "Object ID" field. You will need this later.

7. Return to the Azure AD overview page.

8. In the left-hand menu, click on "App registrations."

9. Search for and select the application associated with your AWS account.

10. In the application's overview page, click on "API permissions" in the left-hand menu.

11. Under the "Configured permissions" section, click on the "Add a permission" button.

12. In the "Request API permissions" pane, select "Azure Active Directory Graph."

13. In the "Application permissions" section, search for and select the following permissions:
    - Directory.Read.All
    - Directory.ReadWrite.All
    - Directory.AccessAsUser.All

14. Click on the "Add permissions" button to save the changes.

15. In the left-hand menu, click on "Manifest" under the "Manage" section.

16. In the manifest editor, search for the "appRoles" section.

17. Add the following JSON snippet under the "appRoles" section:
    ```json
    {
      "allowedMemberTypes": [
        "Application"
      ],
      "description": "Allows the application to assume network service roles in AWS.",
      "displayName": "Assume network service roles in AWS",
      "id": "<Unique GUID>",
      "isEnabled": true,
      "origin": "Application",
      "value": "AssumeNetworkServiceRoles"
    }
    ```
    Replace `<Unique GUID>` with a unique GUID value.

18. Click on the "Save" button to save the manifest changes.

19. Return to the Azure AD overview page.

20. In the left-hand menu, click on "Enterprise applications."

21. Search for and select the AWS application associated with your AWS account.

22. In the application's overview page, click on "Properties" in the left-hand menu.

23. Under the "Single sign-on" section, click on the "Edit" button.

24. In the "User assignment required?" section, toggle the switch to "No."

25. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

26. Finally, contact AWS support and provide them with the Object ID obtained in step 6. Ask them to update the trust policy for the role(s) assumed by network services to allow the Azure AD application to assume those roles.

By following these steps, you will remediate the misconfiguration "Roles Assumable By Network Services" in AWS IAM using the Azure console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of roles assumable by network services in AWS IAM using Azure CLI, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Install Azure CLI: 
   - Visit the Azure CLI installation page: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
   - Follow the instructions to install Azure CLI on your local machine.

2. Authenticate with Azure: 
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to sign in to Azure CLI:
     ```
     az login
     ```
   - Follow the instructions in the terminal to complete the authentication process.

3. List the existing IAM roles: 
   - Run the following command to list all the IAM roles in your AWS account:
     ```
     az role assignment list --all
     ```

4. Identify the network service roles: 
   - Review the output of the previous command and identify the roles that are assumable by network services.
   - These roles may have names like "Network Contributor," "Network Operator," or similar.

5. Remove network service roles: 
   - Run the following command to remove a specific role from being assumable by network services:
     ```
     az role assignment delete --role "<role-name>"
     ```
   - Replace `<role-name>` with the name of the network service role you want to remove.
   - Repeat this command for each network service role identified in step 4.

6. Verify the changes: 
   - Run the following command to verify that the network service roles have been successfully removed:
     ```
     az role assignment list --all
     ```
   - Ensure that the network service roles are no longer listed in the output.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of roles assumable by network services in AWS IAM using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Roles Assumable By Network Services" in AWS IAM using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary Python packages:
   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the required modules:
   ```python
   import boto3
   ```

3. Use the following code to retrieve the list of roles in your AWS account:
   ```python
   def get_roles():
       iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
       response = iam_client.list_roles()
       roles = response['Roles']
       return roles
   ```

4. Iterate through the list of roles and check if any of them allow network services to assume the role:
   ```python
   def check_network_services_assumable(roles):
       roles_with_network_services = []
       for role in roles:
           role_name = role['RoleName']
           role_policies = iam_client.list_role_policies(RoleName=role_name)['PolicyNames']
           for policy_name in role_policies:
               policy = iam_client.get_role_policy(RoleName=role_name, PolicyName=policy_name)['PolicyDocument']
               statements = policy['Statement']
               for statement in statements:
                   if statement['Principal'] == 'network.amazonaws.com':
                       roles_with_network_services.append(role_name)
       return roles_with_network_services
   ```

5. To remediate the misconfiguration, you can update the role's trust policy to restrict the allowed principals. Use the following code to update the trust policy of a role:
   ```python
   def update_trust_policy(role_name):
       trust_policy = {
           'Version': '2012-10-17',
           'Statement': [{
               'Effect': 'Allow',
               'Principal': {
                   'Service': 'ec2.amazonaws.com'
               },
               'Action': 'sts:AssumeRole'
           }]
       }
       iam_client.update_assume_role_policy(RoleName=role_name, PolicyDocument=json.dumps(trust_policy))
   ```

6. Finally, you can call the functions in the following sequence to identify the roles with network services and update their trust policies:
   ```python
   roles = get_roles()
   roles_with_network_services = check_network_services_assumable(roles)
   for role_name in roles_with_network_services:
       update_trust_policy(role_name)
   ```

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to perform these actions in your AWS account. Additionally, modify the code as per your specific requirements and environment.
