#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Principals with Infrastructure modification capabilities" in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using your credentials.
2. Open the IAM service from the console.
3. In the navigation pane on the left, click on "Roles".
4. Identify the role that has infrastructure modification capabilities and needs to be remediated.
5. Select the role by clicking on its name.
6. Review the permissions assigned to the role and identify the infrastructure modification capabilities that need to be removed.
7. Click on the "Permissions" tab to view the attached policies.
8. Review the policies attached to the role and identify the policies granting infrastructure modification capabilities.
9. To remove a policy, click on the policy name and then click on the "Detach Policy" button.
10. Confirm the detachment of the policy when prompted.
11. Repeat steps 9 and 10 for all policies that grant infrastructure modification capabilities.
12. Once all the necessary policies have been detached, review the remaining permissions to ensure the role only has the appropriate permissions required for its intended purpose.
13. Click on the "Trust relationships" tab to review the trusted entities associated with the role.
14. Ensure that the trusted entities are limited to the necessary services or entities and remove any unnecessary trust relationships.
15. After making the necessary changes, click on the "Save changes" button to save the updated role configuration.

By following these steps, you will remediate the misconfiguration "Principals with Infrastructure modification capabilities" in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of principals with infrastructure modification capabilities in AWS IAM using the Azure CLI, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Install and configure the Azure CLI on your local machine, if you haven't already. You can find the installation instructions for your specific operating system on the Azure CLI documentation.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and authenticate to your Azure account by running the following command:
   ```
   az login
   ```

3. After successful authentication, set the Azure subscription where the remediation will be applied by running the following command:
   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
   ```
   Replace `<subscription_id>` with the ID of the Azure subscription you want to use.

4. Create an Azure Resource Group (if one doesn't exist already) to manage the resources required for the remediation. Run the following command to create a new resource group:
   ```
   az group create --name <resource_group_name> --location <location>
   ```
   Replace `<resource_group_name>` with a suitable name for the resource group, and `<location>` with the desired Azure region.

5. Create an Azure Storage Account (if one doesn't exist already) to store the necessary configuration files for the remediation. Run the following command to create a new storage account:
   ```
   az storage account create --name <storage_account_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --location <location> --sku Standard_LRS
   ```
   Replace `<storage_account_name>` with a suitable name for the storage account.

6. Generate a SAS (Shared Access Signature) token for the storage account to allow access to the configuration files. Run the following command to generate the SAS token:
   ```
   az storage account generate-sas --account-name <storage_account_name> --expiry <expiry_date> --permissions r --resource-types co --services bfqt --https-only --output tsv
   ```
   Replace `<storage_account_name>` with the name of the storage account created in the previous step, and `<expiry_date>` with the desired expiration date for the SAS token.

7. Retrieve the connection string for the storage account by running the following command:
   ```
   az storage account show-connection-string --name <storage_account_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --query 'connectionString' --output tsv
   ```
   Replace `<storage_account_name>` and `<resource_group_name>` with the appropriate values.

8. Use the obtained connection string and SAS token to upload the necessary configuration files to the storage account. You can create a JSON file containing the desired IAM policies and upload it using the Azure Storage Explorer or by running the following command:
   ```
   az storage blob upload --account-name <storage_account_name> --container-name <container_name> --name <blob_name> --type block --connection-string "<connection_string>" --sas-token "<sas_token>"
   ```
   Replace `<storage_account_name>`, `<container_name>`, `<blob_name>`, `<connection_string>`, and `<sas_token>` with the appropriate values.

9. Once the configuration files are uploaded, you can use the Azure CLI to apply the IAM policies to remediate the misconfiguration. Run the following command to update the IAM policies:
   ```
   az storage blob service-properties update --account-name <storage_account_name> --static-website --404-document error.html --connection-string "<connection_string>" --sas-token "<sas_token>"
   ```
   Replace `<storage_account_name>`, `<connection_string>`, and `<sas_token>` with the appropriate values.

10. Verify that the IAM policies have been successfully applied by checking the AWS IAM console or by using the AWS CLI.

By following these steps, you can use the Azure CLI to remediate the misconfiguration of principals with infrastructure modification capabilities in AWS IAM.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of principals with infrastructure modification capabilities in AWS IAM using Python, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the required libraries:
   ```python
   import boto3
   ```

3. Initialize the AWS IAM client:
   ```python
   iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
   ```

4. Retrieve a list of all IAM roles:
   ```python
   response = iam_client.list_roles()
   roles = response['Roles']
   ```

5. Iterate through each role and update the permissions to remove infrastructure modification capabilities:
   ```python
   for role in roles:
       role_name = role['RoleName']
       response = iam_client.update_assume_role_policy(
           RoleName=role_name,
           PolicyDocument='{"Version": "2012-10-17","Statement": [{"Effect": "Allow","Principal": {"AWS": "*"},"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"}]}'
       )
       print(f"Updated assume role policy for role: {role_name}")
   ```

   This code snippet updates the assume role policy for each role, removing any specific principal with infrastructure modification capabilities and allowing only the `sts:AssumeRole` action for all AWS principals.

6. Run the Python script, and it will iterate through each IAM role and update the assume role policy.

Please note that this script assumes you have the necessary permissions to update IAM roles and policies. Make sure you have appropriate credentials and permissions before executing the script.
