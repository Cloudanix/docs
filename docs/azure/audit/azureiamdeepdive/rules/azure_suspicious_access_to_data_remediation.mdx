### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate roles having suspicious access in AWS IAM using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the IAM service.
3. Click on "Roles" in the left-hand navigation pane.
4. Review the list of roles and identify the ones with suspicious access.
5. Select the role you want to remediate by clicking on its name.
6. In the role details page, click on the "Permissions" tab.
7. Review the attached policies and inline policies associated with the role.
8. Identify any policies that grant excessive or unnecessary permissions.
9. Remove any unnecessary policies by clicking on the "x" next to the policy name.
10. Review the trust relationships associated with the role.
11. Ensure that only trusted entities are allowed to assume the role. If there are any suspicious or unknown entities, remove them by clicking on the "Edit trust relationship" button and modifying the JSON policy.
12. Click on the "Access Advisor" tab to view the last accessed information for the role.
13. Review the access history and identify any suspicious or unused access.
14. If any suspicious access is found, consider rotating the credentials associated with the role.
15. Once you have made the necessary changes, click on the "Save changes" button to apply the remediation.

It is important to regularly review and monitor the access and permissions granted to roles in AWS IAM to ensure the security of your resources.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of roles having suspicious access in AWS IAM using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Install Azure CLI: If you haven't already, install Azure CLI on your local machine by following the installation instructions provided by Azure.

2. Authenticate with Azure: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to sign in to Azure CLI:
   ```
   az login
   ```

3. List IAM Roles: Run the following command to list all the IAM roles in your AWS account:
   ```
   az role assignment list --all
   ```

4. Identify Suspicious Roles: Review the output of the above command and identify the roles that have suspicious access or are not required.

5. Remove Suspicious Roles: To remove a suspicious role, run the following command:
   ```
   az role assignment delete --assignee <role-assignment-id>
   ```
   Replace `<role-assignment-id>` with the ID of the role assignment you want to remove. Repeat this command for each suspicious role you identified in step 4.

6. Verify Removal: Run the command from step 3 again to ensure that the suspicious roles have been successfully removed.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the issue of roles having suspicious access in AWS IAM using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of roles having suspicious access in both Azure and AWS IAM using Python, follow the steps below:

For Azure:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.authorization import AuthorizationManagementClient
```

2. Authenticate with Azure using the DefaultAzureCredential:

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
authorization_client = AuthorizationManagementClient(credential, <subscription_id>)
```
Replace `<subscription_id>` with the ID of your Azure subscription.

3. Retrieve the list of roles assigned to each user or service principal:

```python
roles = authorization_client.role_assignments.list()
```

4. Iterate through the roles and check for any suspicious access:

```python
for role in roles:
    if "suspicious_access" in role.role_definition_name:
        authorization_client.role_assignments.delete(role.name)
```

5. Save the Python script and execute it to remove any role assignments with suspicious access.

For AWS IAM:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create an AWS IAM client:

```python
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
```

3. Retrieve the list of roles:

```python
roles = iam_client.list_roles()['Roles']
```

4. Iterate through the roles and check for any suspicious access:

```python
for role in roles:
    if "suspicious_access" in role['RoleName']:
        iam_client.delete_role(RoleName=role['RoleName'])
```

5. Save the Python script and execute it to delete any roles with suspicious access.

Note: Replace "suspicious_access" with the specific keyword or pattern you want to match for identifying suspicious access.

Make sure you have the necessary permissions and credentials to perform these actions in both Azure and AWS IAM.
