### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal using your login credentials. 

2. Navigate to SQL servers: From the left-hand side menu, select "SQL servers" under the "Databases" section. This will display a list of all the SQL servers in your Azure environment.

3. Select the SQL server: Click on the name of the SQL server for which you want to check the Threat Detection Retention Period. This will open the SQL server's dashboard.

4. Check Threat Detection settings: From the SQL server's dashboard, select "Security" from the left-hand side menu, then click on "Advanced Threat Protection". Here, you can see the "Retention Period" setting. If the retention period is set to less than 90 days, it is considered a short threat detection retention period.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft website and follow the installation instructions.

2. Login to Azure: After installing Azure CLI, you need to login to your Azure account. Open your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:
   ```
   az login
   ```
   This command will open a new window in your web browser asking you to login to your Azure account. After logging in, you can close the browser window and return to the terminal.

3. List SQL Servers: Now, you need to list all the SQL servers in your Azure account. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```
   az sql server list --query "[].{name:name, resourceGroup:resourceGroup}"
   ```
   This command will return a list of all SQL servers along with their resource group names.

4. Check Threat Detection Retention Period: For each SQL server, you can check the threat detection retention period by running the following command:
   ```
   az sql server threat-policy show --name {server_name} --resource-group {resource_group_name} --query "retentionDays"
   ```
   Replace `{server_name}` and `{resource_group_name}` with the actual name and resource group of your SQL server. This command will return the number of days for which threat detection data is retained. If this number is less than the recommended value (usually 90 days), then it indicates a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with Azure resources, you need to install the Azure SDK for Python. You can do this using pip:

   ```python
   pip install azure-mgmt-sql
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules and set up Azure credentials: You'll need to import the necessary modules and set up your Azure credentials. You can do this using the Azure Identity library and the Azure Management Client.

   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'  # replace with your Azure Subscription ID
   sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
   ```

3. List all SQL servers and check the threat detection policy: You can list all SQL servers in your subscription and then check the threat detection policy for each server. If the retention period is less than the recommended value, print a warning message.

   ```python
   for server in sql_client.servers.list():
       server_name = server.name
       resource_group = server.id.split('/')[4]  # extract resource group from server id
       threat_policy = sql_client.server_security_alert_policies.get(resource_group, server_name)
       if threat_policy.retention_days < 90:  # replace with the recommended retention period
           print(f"Warning: Short Threat Detection Retention Period for SQL Server {server_name}")
   ```

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run the script to check the threat detection retention period for all SQL servers in your Azure subscription. If there are any servers with a short retention period, you will see a warning message.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

The short threat detection retention period for SQL Servers in Azure can leave you vulnerable to security threats. Here are the steps to remediate it using the Azure console:

1. Open the Azure portal and navigate to the SQL Server that you want to remediate.

2. In the left-hand menu, click on "Advanced Threat Protection".

3. In the "Advanced Threat Protection" blade, click on "Settings" at the top.

4. Under "Data retention", select the desired retention period. Microsoft recommends a retention period of at least 90 days.

5. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

6. Once the retention period is set, you can configure alerts and view threat detection reports to monitor your SQL Server for potential security threats.

By following these steps, you can remediate the short threat detection retention period for SQL Servers in Azure and improve the security of your environment.

#### Using CLI

The remediation steps for this misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI are as follows:

1. Open Azure CLI and login to your Azure account.

2. Run the following command to get a list of all the SQL servers in your Azure account:

```
az sql server list
```

3. Identify the SQL server for which you want to increase the threat detection retention period and note down its resource group and name.

4. Run the following command to set the threat detection retention period for the SQL server to 90 days (you can adjust the retention period as per your requirement):

```
az sql server threat-detection-policy update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <server-name> --state Enabled --retention-days 90
```

5. Verify that the retention period has been updated by running the following command:

```
az sql server threat-detection-policy show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <server-name>
```

This command will show the current threat detection policy for the SQL server, including the retention period.

By following these steps, you can increase the threat detection retention period for a SQL server in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

The threat detection retention period for SQL servers in Azure is set to a default of 90 days. This means that any log data older than 90 days is automatically deleted. To remediate this, you can use the Azure Python SDK to update the retention period to a longer duration. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Install the Azure Python SDK using pip: 

```
pip install azure-mgmt-monitor
```

2. Authenticate to your Azure account using the SDK. You can use the following code to authenticate using a service principal:

```
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

TENANT_ID = 'your_tenant_id'
CLIENT_ID = 'your_client_id'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'your_client_secret'

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=CLIENT_ID,
    secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
    tenant=TENANT_ID
)
```

3. Connect to the Azure Monitor API using the SDK:

```
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import DiagnosticSettingsResource

SUBSCRIPTION_ID = 'your_subscription_id'
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME = 'your_resource_group_name'
WORKSPACE_NAME = 'your_workspace_name'
SQL_SERVER_NAME = 'your_sql_server_name'

monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(
    credentials,
    SUBSCRIPTION_ID
)

resource_id = f"/subscriptions/{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/{RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/{SQL_SERVER_NAME}"
workspace_id = f"/subscriptions/{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/{RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{WORKSPACE_NAME}"
```

4. Retrieve the current diagnostic settings for the SQL server:

```
diagnostic_settings = monitor_client.diagnostic_settings.list(resource_id)
```

5. Update the retention period for the SQL server:

```
for setting in diagnostic_settings.value:
    if setting.workspace_id == workspace_id:
        setting.logs[0].retention_policy.enabled = True
        setting.logs[0].retention_policy.days = 365
        monitor_client.diagnostic_settings.create_or_update(
            resource_id,
            setting.name,
            DiagnosticSettingsResource(
                id=setting.id,
                name=setting.name,
                type=setting.type,
                location=setting.location,
                tags=setting.tags,
                workspace_id=setting.workspace_id,
                logs=[setting.logs[0]]
            )
        )
```

In this code, we are updating the retention period to 365 days. You can adjust this value to your desired duration.

6. Run the Python script to update the retention period for your SQL server in Azure.
