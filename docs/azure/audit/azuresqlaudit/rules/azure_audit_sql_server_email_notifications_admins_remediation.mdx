### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to the SQL servers page. You can do this by searching for "SQL servers" in the search bar at the top of the Azure portal.

2. Select the SQL server you want to check for the misconfiguration. This will open the SQL server's dashboard.

3. In the SQL server's dashboard, navigate to the "Security" section and then click on "Vulnerability Assessment". 

4. In the Vulnerability Assessment settings, check if the "Send email notifications to admins and subscription owners" setting is enabled. If it is not, then this is a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine and sign in to your Azure account. You can install Azure CLI by following the instructions on the official Azure CLI documentation. Once installed, you can sign in to your Azure account using the command `az login`.

2. List all SQL servers: Use the following command to list all the SQL servers in your Azure account. This will return a list of all SQL servers along with their details.

    ```
    az sql server list
    ```
3. Check Vulnerability Assessment settings: For each SQL server, you need to check the Vulnerability Assessment settings. You can do this using the following command. Replace `<server_name>` and `<resource_group>` with the name of your SQL server and the resource group it belongs to, respectively.

    ```
    az sql va list --name <server_name> --resource-group <resource_group>
    ```
   This command will return the Vulnerability Assessment settings for the specified SQL server.

4. Check email notification settings: In the output of the previous command, look for the `emailAdmins` and `emailAddresses` fields. If `emailAdmins` is set to `true` and `emailAddresses` contains the email addresses of the admins and subscription owners, then the Vulnerability Assessment setting to send email notifications to admins and subscription owners is set. If not, then it is not set.

#### Using Python

1. Install and import the necessary Python libraries. You will need the 'azure-mgmt-sql' library to interact with Azure SQL resources. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install azure-mgmt-sql
```
Then, import the necessary modules in your Python script:

```python
from azure.identity import ClientSecretCredential
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
```

2. Establish a connection to your Azure account. You will need your tenant ID, client ID, and client secret to do this. These can be obtained from the Azure portal.

```python
credential = ClientSecretCredential(
    tenant_id="your-tenant-id",
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",
)

subscription_id = "your-subscription-id"
sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

3. Iterate over all SQL servers and databases in your subscription, checking the 'email_admins' setting of each database's vulnerability assessment settings.

```python
for server in sql_client.servers.list():
    for database in sql_client.databases.list_by_server(server.resource_group, server.name):
        va_settings = sql_client.database_vulnerability_assessment_rule_baselines.get(server.resource_group, server.name, database.name)
        if not va_settings.email_admins:
            print(f"Vulnerability Assessment Setting to send email notifications to admins is not set for database {database.name} on server {server.name}")
```

4. The above script will print out the names of all databases and their respective servers where the 'email_admins' setting is not enabled. If no such databases are found, the script will not output anything. This way, you can easily detect any misconfigurations in your Azure SQL resources.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate this misconfiguration in Azure using the Azure console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the Security Center dashboard.
3. Click on "Security policy" on the left-hand side of the screen.
4. Select the subscription you want to remediate.
5. Click on "Vulnerability assessment settings" in the "Security policy" window.
6. Ensure that the "Email notifications to subscription owners and admins" toggle is turned on.
7. If the toggle is not turned on, click on the toggle to turn it on.
8. Click on "Save" to save the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, the vulnerability assessment setting will be configured to send email notifications to subscription owners and admins in case of any security issues.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Vulnerability Assessment Setting To Send Email Notifications To Admins And Subscription Owners Is Set" for Azure using Azure CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI on your computer.

2. Login to your Azure account using the command:

   `az login`

3. Select the Azure subscription in which the misconfiguration exists using the command:

   `az account set --subscription <subscription_id>`

   Replace `<subscription_id>` with the ID of your Azure subscription.

4. Run the below command to enable email notifications for vulnerability assessment:

   `az security va-notification-contacts create --email <email_address> --phone <phone_number> --alert-notifications true --security-contact-name <contact_name>`

   Replace `<email_address>` with the email address of the admin or subscription owner who needs to receive the email notifications.

   Replace `<phone_number>` with the phone number of the admin or subscription owner who needs to receive the SMS notifications.

   Replace `<contact_name>` with the name of the contact to be created.

5. If you want to verify that the email notifications have been enabled, you can run the below command:

   `az security va-notification-contacts list`

   This command will list all the notification contacts that have been created.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Vulnerability Assessment Setting To Send Email Notifications To Admins And Subscription Owners Is Set" for Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Vulnerability Assessment Setting To Send Email Notifications To Admins And Subscription Owners Is Set" for Azure using Python, follow the below steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter
from azure.mgmt.security.models import SecurityAssessmentMetadata, SecurityAssessmentStatus, EmailNotificationSubscription
```

2. Authenticate to Azure using the DefaultAzureCredential:

```
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
security_center_client = SecurityCenter(credential, "your_subscription_id")
```

3. Get the current email notification settings:

```
email_notification_settings = security_center_client.settings.get("emailNotificationSettings")
```

4. Check if the email notification settings are configured to send notifications to admins and subscription owners:

```
if email_notification_settings.send_to_admins_and_subscription_owners is False:
    email_notification_settings.send_to_admins_and_subscription_owners = True
    security_center_client.settings.create_or_update("emailNotificationSettings", email_notification_settings)
```

5. Create a new email notification subscription:

```
email_notification_subscription = EmailNotificationSubscription(
    name="Your Subscription Name",
    email_addresses=["admin@example.com", "owner@example.com"],
    assessment_metadata=SecurityAssessmentMetadata(
        display_name="Security Assessment",
        description="This email notification is sent when a new security assessment is available.",
        severity="High"
    ),
    status=SecurityAssessmentStatus(
        new_assessment=True,
        updated_assessment=True,
        resolved_assessment=True
    )
)

security_center_client.notifications.create_email_subscription(email_notification_subscription)
```

6. Verify that the email notification subscription was created successfully:

```
email_notification_subscriptions = security_center_client.notifications.list_email_subscriptions()
for subscription in email_notification_subscriptions:
    print(subscription.name)
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Vulnerability Assessment Setting To Send Email Notifications To Admins And Subscription Owners Is Set" for Azure using Python.
