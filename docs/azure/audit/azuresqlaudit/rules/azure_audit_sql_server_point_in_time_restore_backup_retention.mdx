### More Info:

Ensure that Microsoft Azure SQL databases have a sufficient Point in Time Restore (PITR) backup retention period configured for security and compliance purposes. Azure SQL service automatically creates database backups that are kept between 7 and 35 days. The SQL service uses Azure read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) to ensure that the backups are preserved even if the primary datacenter becomes unavailable. Prior to running this rule by the Cloud Conformity engine, the PITR backup retention period must configured within the rule settings, on the Cloud Conformity account dashboard. The supported values are: 1, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days. Azure default backup short term retention days setting is 7

<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the issue of insufficient Point-in-Time Restore (PITR) backup retention period in Azure:

1. Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to the Recovery Services vault that contains the protected resources.

2. In the Recovery Services vault, click on the Backup items tab from the left-hand side menu.

3. Select the backup item for which you want to check the PITR retention period.

4. In the Backup item's menu, click on the Backup policy option.

5. In the Backup policy section, scroll down to the Retention tab and check the PITR retention period.

6. If the PITR retention period is less than the required period, click on the Edit button.

7. In the Edit backup policy window, update the PITR retention period as per your requirement.

8. Once you have updated the PITR retention period, click on the Save button to save the changes.

9. After saving the changes, Azure will automatically update the backup policy for the selected backup item.

10. Repeat the same steps for all the backup items that require a longer PITR retention period.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of insufficient Point-in-Time Restore (PITR) backup retention period in Azure.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration related to insufficient Point In Time Restore (PITR) backup retention period in Azure, you can follow the below steps using Azure CLI:

1. Open the Azure CLI in your preferred environment.

2. Check the current PITR backup retention period for your Azure database by running the following command:

   ```
   az sql db show -g <resource-group-name> -s <server-name> -n <database-name> --query "pointInTimeRestoreRetentionDays"
   ```

3. If the value returned by the above command is less than the required retention period, then update the PITR backup retention period by running the following command:

   ```
   az sql db update -g <resource-group-name> -s <server-name> -n <database-name> --backup-storage-redundancy "Geo" --point-in-time-restore --retention-days <required-retention-period>
   ```

   Replace `<resource-group-name>`, `<server-name>`, `<database-name>`, and `<required-retention-period>` with the appropriate values.

4. After running the above command, verify that the PITR backup retention period has been updated by running the following command:

   ```
   az sql db show -g <resource-group-name> -s <server-name> -n <database-name> --query "pointInTimeRestoreRetentionDays"
   ```

   The value returned by this command should be equal to the `<required-retention-period>` specified in the previous step.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration related to insufficient Point In Time Restore (PITR) backup retention period in Azure using Azure CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of insufficient Point In Time Restore (PITR) backup retention period in Azure, you can use the following steps using Python:

1. First, you need to import the necessary modules to access Azure resources using Python. You can use the `azure.identity` module to authenticate your Azure account and `azure.mgmt.sql` module to access the Azure SQL resources.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
```

2. Next, you need to create an instance of the `SqlManagementClient` class by passing the Azure subscription ID and the credential object.

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID'
sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

3. Once you have created the `SqlManagementClient` instance, you can use the `backup_long_term_retention_policies.list_by_server` method to get the backup retention policies for all the databases in the Azure SQL server.

```python
server_name = 'YOUR_SERVER_NAME'
backup_policies = sql_client.backup_long_term_retention_policies.list_by_server(server_name)
```

4. After getting the backup policies, you can iterate through them and check if the retention period is sufficient or not. If the retention period is less than the required period, you can update the policy using the `backup_long_term_retention_policies.create_or_update` method.

```python
required_retention_days = 30
for policy in backup_policies:
    if policy.weekly_retention is None or policy.weekly_retention < required_retention_days:
        policy.weekly_retention = required_retention_days
        sql_client.backup_long_term_retention_policies.create_or_update(
            server_name,
            policy.database_name,
            policy.policy_id,
            policy
        )
```

5. Finally, you can print a message indicating that the remediation has been completed successfully.

```python
print("Backup retention policies have been updated successfully.")
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of insufficient Point In Time Restore (PITR) backup retention period in Azure using Python.
