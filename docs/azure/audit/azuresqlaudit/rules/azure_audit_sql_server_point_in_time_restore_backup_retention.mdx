### More Info:

Ensure that Microsoft Azure SQL databases have a sufficient Point in Time Restore (PITR) backup retention period configured for security and compliance purposes. Azure SQL service automatically creates database backups that are kept between 7 and 35 days. The SQL service uses Azure read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) to ensure that the backups are preserved even if the primary datacenter becomes unavailable. Prior to running this rule by the Cloud Conformity engine, the PITR backup retention period must configured within the rule settings, on the Cloud Conformity account dashboard. The supported values are: 1, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days. Azure default backup short term retention days setting is 7

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Navigate to SQL databases: From the left-hand side menu, select "SQL databases". This will open a list of all the SQL databases that are currently running in your Azure environment.

3. Check backup retention period: Click on the name of the database for which you want to check the backup retention period. This will open the database's dashboard. From here, select "Manage Backups" under the "Operations" section. This will open a new page where you can see the current backup policy, including the retention period.

4. Verify retention period: The retention period is displayed in days. According to Azure's best practices, the retention period should be at least 35 days for Point In Time Restore (PITR) backups. If the displayed retention period is less than this, it indicates a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install the Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal.

2. Login to Azure Account: Use the following command to log in to your Azure account. You will be redirected to the browser for login.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. List SQL Servers: After successful login, list all the SQL servers in your account using the following command. This will give you the list of all SQL servers along with their details.
   ```
   az sql server list
   ```
   Note down the server name and resource group for which you want to check the PITR backup retention period.

4. Check PITR Backup Retention Period: Now, use the following command to list all the databases in the SQL server and their backup retention period.
   ```
   az sql db list --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --server <ServerName> --query "[].{DatabaseName:name, BackupRetentionDays:backupRetentionDays}"
   ```
   Replace `<ResourceGroupName>` and `<ServerName>` with your actual resource group name and server name. This command will give you the list of all databases in the specified SQL server along with their backup retention period in days.

#### Using Python

1. AWS RDS:
   - Install the boto3 library in Python which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python.
   - Use the `describe_db_instances()` function to retrieve all DB instances.
   - For each DB instance, check the `BackupRetentionPeriod` attribute. If it's less than the desired retention period, then it's a misconfiguration.
   - Python script:
     ```python
     import boto3
     client = boto3.client('rds')
     response = client.describe_db_instances()
     for instance in response['DBInstances']:
         if instance['BackupRetentionPeriod'] < DESIRED_RETENTION_PERIOD:
             print(f"DB instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} has insufficient PITR backup retention period.")
     ```

2. Azure SQL Database:
   - Install the azure-mgmt-sql library in Python which is the Microsoft Azure SQL Management SDK for Python.
   - Use the `backup_short_term_retention_policies.list_by_database()` function to retrieve all backup policies.
   - For each backup policy, check the `retention_days` attribute. If it's less than the desired retention period, then it's a misconfiguration.
   - Python script:
     ```python
     from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
     from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
     credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
     sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, SUBSCRIPTION_ID)
     response = sql_client.backup_short_term_retention_policies.list_by_database(RESOURCE_GROUP, SERVER_NAME, DATABASE_NAME)
     for policy in response:
         if policy.retention_days < DESIRED_RETENTION_PERIOD:
             print(f"Database {DATABASE_NAME} has insufficient PITR backup retention period.")
     ```

3. Google Cloud SQL:
   - Install the google-cloud-sql library in Python which is the Google Cloud SQL Admin API Client Library for Python.
   - Use the `instances().get()` function to retrieve the instance details.
   - Check the `settings.backupConfiguration.retainedBackups` attribute. If it's less than the desired retention period, then it's a misconfiguration.
   - Python script:
     ```python
     from googleapiclient import discovery
     from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials
     credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
     service = discovery.build('sqladmin', 'v1beta4', credentials=credentials)
     response = service.instances().get(project=PROJECT_ID, instance=INSTANCE_ID).execute()
     if response['settings']['backupConfiguration']['retainedBackups'] < DESIRED_RETENTION_PERIOD:
         print(f"Instance {INSTANCE_ID} has insufficient PITR backup retention period.")
     ```

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the issue of insufficient Point-in-Time Restore (PITR) backup retention period in Azure:

1. Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to the Recovery Services vault that contains the protected resources.

2. In the Recovery Services vault, click on the Backup items tab from the left-hand side menu.

3. Select the backup item for which you want to check the PITR retention period.

4. In the Backup item's menu, click on the Backup policy option.

5. In the Backup policy section, scroll down to the Retention tab and check the PITR retention period.

6. If the PITR retention period is less than the required period, click on the Edit button.

7. In the Edit backup policy window, update the PITR retention period as per your requirement.

8. Once you have updated the PITR retention period, click on the Save button to save the changes.

9. After saving the changes, Azure will automatically update the backup policy for the selected backup item.

10. Repeat the same steps for all the backup items that require a longer PITR retention period.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of insufficient Point-in-Time Restore (PITR) backup retention period in Azure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration related to insufficient Point In Time Restore (PITR) backup retention period in Azure, you can follow the below steps using Azure CLI:

1. Open the Azure CLI in your preferred environment.

2. Check the current PITR backup retention period for your Azure database by running the following command:

   ```
   az sql db show -g <resource-group-name> -s <server-name> -n <database-name> --query "pointInTimeRestoreRetentionDays"
   ```

3. If the value returned by the above command is less than the required retention period, then update the PITR backup retention period by running the following command:

   ```
   az sql db update -g <resource-group-name> -s <server-name> -n <database-name> --backup-storage-redundancy "Geo" --point-in-time-restore --retention-days <required-retention-period>
   ```

   Replace `<resource-group-name>`, `<server-name>`, `<database-name>`, and `<required-retention-period>` with the appropriate values.

4. After running the above command, verify that the PITR backup retention period has been updated by running the following command:

   ```
   az sql db show -g <resource-group-name> -s <server-name> -n <database-name> --query "pointInTimeRestoreRetentionDays"
   ```

   The value returned by this command should be equal to the `<required-retention-period>` specified in the previous step.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration related to insufficient Point In Time Restore (PITR) backup retention period in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of insufficient Point In Time Restore (PITR) backup retention period in Azure, you can use the following steps using Python:

1. First, you need to import the necessary modules to access Azure resources using Python. You can use the `azure.identity` module to authenticate your Azure account and `azure.mgmt.sql` module to access the Azure SQL resources.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
```

2. Next, you need to create an instance of the `SqlManagementClient` class by passing the Azure subscription ID and the credential object.

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID'
sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

3. Once you have created the `SqlManagementClient` instance, you can use the `backup_long_term_retention_policies.list_by_server` method to get the backup retention policies for all the databases in the Azure SQL server.

```python
server_name = 'YOUR_SERVER_NAME'
backup_policies = sql_client.backup_long_term_retention_policies.list_by_server(server_name)
```

4. After getting the backup policies, you can iterate through them and check if the retention period is sufficient or not. If the retention period is less than the required period, you can update the policy using the `backup_long_term_retention_policies.create_or_update` method.

```python
required_retention_days = 30
for policy in backup_policies:
    if policy.weekly_retention is None or policy.weekly_retention < required_retention_days:
        policy.weekly_retention = required_retention_days
        sql_client.backup_long_term_retention_policies.create_or_update(
            server_name,
            policy.database_name,
            policy.policy_id,
            policy
        )
```

5. Finally, you can print a message indicating that the remediation has been completed successfully.

```python
print("Backup retention policies have been updated successfully.")
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of insufficient Point In Time Restore (PITR) backup retention period in Azure using Python.
