<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of not having Geo-Redundant Backups enabled in Azure, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Log in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com/.
2. Navigate to the resource group that contains the storage account you want to remediate.
3. Select the storage account from the list of resources.
4. In the left-hand menu, click on "Backup".
5. In the "Backup" menu, click on "Backup policy".
6. Click on "Edit".
7. In the "Policy details" section, select "Geo-redundant" from the "Replication" drop-down menu.
8. Click on "Save".

After completing these steps, Geo-Redundant Backups will be enabled for the selected storage account. It is recommended to regularly review and update backup policies to ensure that they align with your business continuity and disaster recovery requirements.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of not having Geo-Redundant Backups enabled in Azure using Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI command prompt or terminal.

2. Login to your Azure account using the command: 

   ```
   az login
   ```

3. Once you are logged in, set the target subscription using the command:

   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
   ```

4. Next, enable Geo-Redundant Backups for the desired resource group using the command:

   ```
   az backup vault backup-properties set --backup-management-type AzureIaasVM --resource-group <resource_group_name> --vault-name <vault_name> --backup-storage-redundancy GeoRedundant
   ```

   Here, replace `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group where the backup vault is located and `<vault_name>` with the name of the backup vault.

5. Verify the backup properties using the command:

   ```
   az backup vault backup-properties show --backup-management-type AzureIaasVM --resource-group <resource_group_name> --vault-name <vault_name>
   ```

   This command will display the backup properties for the specified backup vault.

6. Once you have verified that Geo-Redundant Backups have been enabled, you can exit the Azure CLI using the command:

   ```
   exit
   ```

With these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration of not having Geo-Redundant Backups enabled in Azure using Azure CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of not having Geo-Redundant Backups enabled in Azure using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using pip:

```python
pip install azure-mgmt-recoveryservicesbackup
```

2. Import the necessary modules:

```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.recoveryservicesbackup import RecoveryServicesBackupClient
from azure.mgmt.recoveryservicesbackup.models import ProtectionIntent
```

3. Set up the authentication credentials using a service principal:

```python
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id='<client_id>',
    secret='<client_secret>',
    tenant='<tenant_id>'
)
```

4. Instantiate the `RecoveryServicesBackupClient` using the authentication credentials:

```python
client = RecoveryServicesBackupClient(credentials, '<subscription_id>')
```

5. Get the list of protection intents:

```python
protection_intents = client.protection_intents.list()
```

6. Check if Geo-Redundant Backups are enabled for each protection intent:

```python
for protection_intent in protection_intents:
    if protection_intent.properties.backup_management_type == 'AzureIaasVM':
        if not protection_intent.properties.is_geo_redundant:
            # Enable Geo-Redundant Backups
            protection_intent.properties.is_geo_redundant = True
            client.protection_intents.create_or_update(
                protection_intent.name,
                protection_intent
            )
```

7. Save the changes by calling `create_or_update` on each protection intent that had Geo-Redundant Backups enabled.

That's it! With these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not having Geo-Redundant Backups enabled in Azure using Python.
