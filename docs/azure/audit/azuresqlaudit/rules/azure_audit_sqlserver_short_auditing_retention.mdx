### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal by entering "https://portal.azure.com" in your web browser's address bar. Enter your Azure account credentials to log in.

2. Navigate to SQL servers: Once you're logged in, click on the hamburger icon (three horizontal lines) in the top left corner of the Azure portal. This will open the navigation pane. From the navigation pane, click on "SQL servers" under the "Databases" section.

3. Select the SQL server: In the SQL servers pane, you will see a list of all the SQL servers in your Azure account. Click on the SQL server for which you want to check the auditing retention period.

4. Check the auditing settings: After selecting the SQL server, navigate to the "Security" section in the left-hand menu and click on "Auditing". In the Auditing pane, you can see the "Retention (days)" setting. This setting shows the number of days for which the audit logs are retained. If this number is less than the recommended retention period, it indicates a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal.

2. Login to Azure: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be redirected to the browser for login. Enter your credentials and login.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. List SQL Servers: Now, you need to list all the SQL servers in your Azure account. Use the following command to do so. This command will return a list of all SQL servers along with their properties.
   ```
   az sql server list --query "[].{name:name, resourceGroup:resourceGroup}"
   ```
4. Check Auditing Retention Period: For each SQL server, you need to check the auditing retention period. Use the following command to do so. Replace `<server_name>` and `<resource_group>` with your actual server name and resource group.
   ```
   az sql server audit-policy show --name <server_name> --resource-group <resource_group> --query 'retentionDays'
   ```
   If the returned value is less than the recommended retention period (for example, 90 days), then it's a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You will need the 'azure-mgmt-sql' library to interact with Azure SQL servers. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install azure-mgmt-sql
```

2. Authenticate with Azure: To interact with Azure resources, you need to authenticate your script. You can do this using Azure's Service Principal credentials. Here's how you can authenticate:

```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id = 'your_client_id',
    secret = 'your_secret',
    tenant = 'your_tenant_id'
)
```

3. Connect to the SQL Server: Once authenticated, you can connect to the SQL server. You will need the subscription ID and the resource group name. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient

sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credentials, 'your_subscription_id')
server = sql_client.servers.get('your_resource_group', 'your_server_name')
```

4. Check the Auditing Retention Period: Now that you are connected to the SQL server, you can check the auditing retention period. If the retention period is less than 90 days, it is considered a misconfiguration. Here's how you can check it:

```python
auditing_settings = sql_client.server_blob_auditing_policies.get('your_resource_group', 'your_server_name')
retention_days = auditing_settings.retention_days

if retention_days < 90:
    print(f"Misconfiguration detected: Auditing retention period is only {retention_days} days.")
else:
    print(f"No misconfiguration detected: Auditing retention period is {retention_days} days.")
```

This script will print a message indicating whether a misconfiguration has been detected based on the auditing retention period.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the short auditing retention period for SQL servers in Azure, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Azure Portal and go to the SQL Server that you want to remediate.

2. Click on the "Auditing" option in the left-hand menu.

3. In the "Auditing" section, click on "Diagnostic settings".

4. Click on the "Add diagnostic setting" button.

5. In the "Add diagnostic setting" window, give a name for the new diagnostic setting.

6. Under "Destination details", select "Log Analytics" or "Event Hub" as the destination.

7. If you choose "Log Analytics", select the Log Analytics workspace that you want to use.

8. Under "Categories", select the "SQLSecurityAuditEvents" category.

9. Under "Retention (days)", set the retention period to the desired number of days. 

10. Click on the "Save" button to save the diagnostic setting.

Once the diagnostic setting is saved, the SQL server will start sending the audit logs to the destination you selected. The audit logs will be retained for the number of days you specified in the retention period.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the short auditing retention period for SQL servers in AZURE using AZURE CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AZURE CLI and log in to your AZURE account.
2. Use the following command to check the current retention period for auditing logs in your SQL server:

   ```
   az sql server audit-policy show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <sql-server-name> --name "Default"
   ```

   Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group in which your SQL server is located, and `<sql-server-name>` with the name of your SQL server.

3. If the retention period is less than the required period, use the following command to update the audit policy:

   ```
   az sql server audit-policy update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <sql-server-name> --name "Default" --state Enabled --retention-days <retention-days>
   ```

   Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group in which your SQL server is located, `<sql-server-name>` with the name of your SQL server, and `<retention-days>` with the required retention period in days.

4. After executing the command, verify the updated retention period using the command in step 2.

By following these steps, you can remediate the short auditing retention period for SQL servers in AZURE using AZURE CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the short auditing retention period for SQL Servers in Azure using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries: 

```python
import os
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
```

2. Set the credentials and subscription ID:

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
```

3. Create an instance of the `SqlManagementClient`:

```python
sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

4. Get the list of SQL servers in the subscription:

```python
servers = sql_client.servers.list()
```

5. For each server, check the auditing retention period and update it if it is less than the desired value:

```python
for server in servers:
    audit_policy = sql_client.server_audit_policies.get(server.resource_group, server.name, "default")
    if audit_policy.retention_days < 90:
        audit_policy.retention_days = 90
        sql_client.server_audit_policies.create_or_update(server.resource_group, server.name, "default", audit_policy)
```

In the above code, we are checking the retention period for the default audit policy of each SQL server. If the retention period is less than 90 days, we are updating it to 90 days.

Note: This code assumes that you have the necessary permissions to access and modify the audit policies of the SQL servers in your Azure subscription.
