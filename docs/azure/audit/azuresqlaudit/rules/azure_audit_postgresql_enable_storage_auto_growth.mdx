### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the SQL databases section from the left-hand side menu. Here, you will see a list of all your SQL databases.
3. Click on the specific SQL database for which you want to check the auto-growth configuration.
4. In the database dashboard, go to the "Settings" section and click on "Configuration". Here, you can see the "Enable Storage Auto-Growth" setting. If it's enabled, it will show "ON", otherwise, it will show "OFF".

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal and type `az login` to log in to your Azure account.

2. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, you need to select the subscription where your SQL Server is located. Use the following command to list all your subscriptions: `az account list --output table`. Then, use the following command to set your desired subscription: `az account set --subscription "my-subscription-name"`.

3. Get the Server Details: Use the following command to get the details of your SQL Server: `az sql server show --name "my-server-name" --resource-group "my-resource-group"`. This will return a JSON object with all the details of your SQL Server.

4. Check for Auto-Growth: To check if Storage Auto-Growth is enabled, you need to look at the `storageProfile` property in the JSON object returned in the previous step. If the `storageProfile` property contains `storageAutogrow: Enabled`, then Storage Auto-Growth is enabled. If it says `storageAutogrow: Disabled`, then it is not enabled.

#### Using Python

To check if Storage Auto-Growth is enabled in SQL Server, you can use the `pyodbc` library in Python to connect to your SQL Server and execute a SQL query to fetch the necessary information. Here are the steps:

1. **Install the necessary Python library:**
   You need to install the `pyodbc` library which is used to connect Python with SQL Server. You can install it using pip:
   ```python
   pip install pyodbc
   ```

2. **Establish a connection to your SQL Server:**
   You need to establish a connection to your SQL Server. Replace the placeholders with your actual server details.
   ```python
   import pyodbc 
   conn = pyodbc.connect('Driver={SQL Server};'
                         'Server=server_name;'
                         'Database=db_name;'
                         'Trusted_Connection=yes;')
   ```

3. **Execute a SQL query to check if Auto-Growth is enabled:**
   You can execute a SQL query to fetch the necessary information. The `sys.database_files` view contains information about the data and log files of a database. The `is_percent_growth` column indicates whether the file is set to grow by a percentage. If it's 1, the file is set to grow by a percentage. If it's 0, the file is set to grow by a fixed amount in megabytes.
   ```python
   cursor = conn.cursor()
   cursor.execute("SELECT name, is_percent_growth FROM sys.database_files WHERE type = 0")
   ```

4. **Print the result:**
   You can print the result to check if Auto-Growth is enabled for each file.
   ```python
   for row in cursor:
       print('Name:', row[0])
       print('Is Auto-Growth Enabled:', 'Yes' if row[1] == 1 else 'No')
   ```
   This will print the name of each file and whether Auto-Growth is enabled for it.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not having storage auto-growth enabled in Azure, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the storage account that you want to remediate.
3. Click on the "Configuration" tab in the left-hand menu.
4. Under the "Data Protection" section, click on "Blob Service".
5. Scroll down to the "Auto-grow" section and toggle the switch to "Enabled".
6. Specify the maximum size that you want the storage account to grow to. You can either choose a fixed size or enable automatic growth by percentage.
7. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, your storage account will automatically grow as needed to accommodate additional data. This will help prevent any potential data loss due to insufficient storage capacity.

#### Using CLI

To enable storage auto-growth for Azure using Azure CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI on your local machine or on the Azure portal.

2. Login to your Azure account using the command:

   ```
   az login
   ```

3. Select the subscription in which you want to enable storage auto-growth using the command:

   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
   ```

4. Once you have selected the subscription, enable storage auto-growth for the Azure SQL Database using the command:

   ```
   az sql db update --name <database-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --service-objective S0 --max-size 250GB --auto-grow true
   ```

   In the above command, replace the `<database-name>` with the name of the database for which you want to enable storage auto-growth, `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group in which the database is present.

   The `--max-size` parameter specifies the maximum size of the database and the `--auto-grow` parameter enables the storage auto-growth for the database.

5. Once the command is executed successfully, you will receive a confirmation message.

   ```
   {
     "autoPauseDelay": null,
     "catalogCollation": "SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS",
     "collation": "SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS",

     "requestedServiceObjectiveName": null,
     "resourceGroup": "xxxxx",
     "restorableDroppedDatabaseId": null,
     "restorePointInTime": null,
     "sampleName": null,
     "serviceLevelObjective": "S0",
     "sourceDatabaseDeletionDate": null,
     "sourceDatabaseId": null,
     "status": "Online",
     "tags": {},
     "type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases",
     "zoneRedundant": false
   }
   ```

   This confirms that storage auto-growth has been enabled for the Azure SQL Database.

#### Using Python

To enable storage auto-growth in Azure using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps to remediate this issue:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python:

```
pip install azure-mgmt-storage
```

2. Import the necessary modules:

```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.storage import StorageManagementClient
```

3. Authenticate with Azure using Service Principal credentials:

```python
TENANT_ID = '<your tenant id>'
CLIENT_ID = '<your client id>'
CLIENT_SECRET = '<your client secret>'
SUBSCRIPTION_ID = '<your subscription id>'

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=CLIENT_ID,
    secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
    tenant=TENANT_ID
)
```

4. Create a StorageManagementClient object:

```python
storage_client = StorageManagementClient(
    credentials=credentials,
    subscription_id=SUBSCRIPTION_ID
)
```

5. Get the storage account that needs to be remediated:

```python
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME = '<your resource group name>'
ACCOUNT_NAME = '<your storage account name>'

storage_account = storage_client.storage_accounts.get_properties(
    RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME,
    ACCOUNT_NAME
)
```

6. Enable storage auto-growth by updating the storage account:

```python
storage_account.auto_grow_enabled = True

storage_client.storage_accounts.update(
    RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME,
    ACCOUNT_NAME,
    storage_account
)
```

This will enable storage auto-growth for the specified storage account in Azure.
