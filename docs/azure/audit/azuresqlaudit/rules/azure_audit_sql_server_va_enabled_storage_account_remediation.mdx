To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure That Vulnerability Assessment Is Enabled On SQL Server By Setting Storage Account" in Azure using Azure console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the SQL server that you want to remediate.
3. Click on the "Security + Compliance" option from the left-hand side menu.
4. Under the "Security + Compliance" menu, click on the "Vulnerability assessment" option.
5. In the "Vulnerability assessment" page, click on the "Storage settings" tab.
6. Click on the "Configure storage settings" button.
7. In the "Configure storage settings" page, select the "Use existing storage account" option.
8. Select the storage account that you want to use for vulnerability assessment.
9. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

By following the above steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Ensure That Vulnerability Assessment Is Enabled On SQL Server By Setting Storage Account" in Azure using Azure console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this misconfiguration in AZURE using AZURE CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AZURE CLI terminal and log in to your AZURE account using the command `az login`.

2. Once you are logged in, set the subscription in which the SQL Server is running using the command `az account set --subscription <subscription_id>`.

3. Now, create a new storage account or use an existing one to store the vulnerability assessment scan results. You can create a new storage account using the command `az storage account create --name <storage_account_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --location <location> --sku Standard_LRS`, where `<storage_account_name>` is the name of the storage account, `<resource_group_name>` is the name of the resource group in which the storage account will be created, and `<location>` is the location where the storage account will be created.

4. Once the storage account is created, enable vulnerability assessment on the SQL Server using the command `az sql server va create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --server <sql_server_name> --storage-account <storage_account_name> --storage-key <storage_account_key> --scan-results-container-name <container_name>`, where `<resource_group_name>` is the name of the resource group in which the SQL Server is running, `<sql_server_name>` is the name of the SQL Server, `<storage_account_name>` is the name of the storage account created in step 3, `<storage_account_key>` is the access key of the storage account, and `<container_name>` is the name of the container in which the vulnerability assessment scan results will be stored.

5. Once the vulnerability assessment is enabled, you can run a scan on the SQL Server using the command `az sql server va scan create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --server <sql_server_name> --scan-id <scan_id>`, where `<resource_group_name>` is the name of the resource group in which the SQL Server is running, `<sql_server_name>` is the name of the SQL Server, and `<scan_id>` is the ID of the vulnerability assessment scan.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration and ensure that vulnerability assessment is enabled on SQL Server by setting the storage account in AZURE using AZURE CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure that Vulnerability Assessment is enabled on SQL Server by setting storage account" in Azure using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.storage import StorageManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.storage.models import StorageAccountCreateParameters
```

2. Set up the Azure credentials:

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = '<subscription_id>'
resource_group_name = '<resource_group_name>'
server_name = '<server_name>'
database_name = '<database_name>'
storage_account_name = '<storage_account_name>'
storage_account_key = '<storage_account_key>'
```

3. Create a Storage Account:

```python
storage_client = StorageManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
storage_params = StorageAccountCreateParameters(
    sku={"name": "Standard_LRS"},
    kind="StorageV2",
    location="<location>"
)
storage_async_operation = storage_client.storage_accounts.create(
    resource_group_name,
    storage_account_name,
    storage_params
)
storage_account = storage_async_operation.result()
```

4. Enable Vulnerability Assessment on SQL Server:

```python
sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
sql_client.vulnerability_assessments.create_or_update(
    resource_group_name,
    server_name,
    database_name,
    "default",
    {
        "storage_container_path": "<container_path>",
        "storage_account_access_key": storage_account_key,
        "recurring_scans": {
            "isEnabled": True,
            "emailSubscriptionAdmins": False,
            "emails": []
        }
    }
)
```

5. Verify that Vulnerability Assessment is enabled:

```python
vulnerability_assessment = sql_client.vulnerability_assessments.get(
    resource_group_name,
    server_name,
    database_name,
    "default"
)
print(vulnerability_assessment.state)
```

Note: Replace the placeholders `<subscription_id>`, `<resource_group_name>`, `<server_name>`, `<database_name>`, `<storage_account_name>`, `<storage_account_key>`, `<location>` and `<container_path>` with the appropriate values for your environment.
