### More Info:

Ensure that your Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB accounts are using the Automatic Failover feature in order to enable resource replication and fault tolerance at the account level. Automatic failover allows Azure Cosmos DB to failover to the Azure cloud region with the highest failover priority when the source region become unavailable, without any additional action from the application or the user. The Cosmos DB account must have two or more regions configured in order to enable the feature.
