#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the "Threat Detection Alerts Disabled for SQL Servers" misconfiguration in Azure:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Navigate to the SQL Server that you want to remediate.

3. Click on the "Security" tab in the left-hand menu.

4. Under the "Advanced Data Security" section, click on "Threat Detection" to open the settings page.

5. In the "Threat Detection" settings page, toggle the switch to "On" to enable threat detection.

6. Choose the types of alerts you want to receive by selecting the appropriate checkboxes.

7. Set the email address(es) where you want to receive the alerts.

8. Click on the "Save" button to save your changes.

9. Wait for a few minutes for the changes to take effect.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the "Threat Detection Alerts Disabled for SQL Servers" misconfiguration in Azure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Threat Detection Alerts Disabled for SQL Servers" in Azure using Azure CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open Azure CLI and login to your Azure account using the command:

```
az login
```

Step 2: Once you are logged in, run the following command to check if threat detection is enabled for your SQL server:

```
az sql server threat-policy show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <sql-server-name>
```

Step 3: If the output shows that the threat detection is disabled, run the following command to enable it:

```
az sql server threat-policy update --state Enabled --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <sql-server-name>
```

Note: Replace `<resource-group-name>` and `<sql-server-name>` with the actual names of your resource group and SQL server respectively.

Step 4: Once the command is executed successfully, the threat detection will be enabled for your SQL server.

Step 5: Verify the status of the threat detection using the command in Step 2.

This will remediate the misconfiguration "Threat Detection Alerts Disabled for SQL Servers" in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Threat Detection Alerts Disabled for SQL Servers" misconfiguration in Azure using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps to do so:

1. First, you need to authenticate to Azure using your credentials. You can do this using the `DefaultAzureCredential` class from the `azure.identity` package. Here's an example:

```
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = '<your-subscription-id>'

resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

2. Next, you need to get a list of all the SQL servers in your Azure subscription. You can do this using the `sql_client.servers.list()` method. Here's an example:

```
servers = sql_client.servers.list()
```

3. For each SQL server, you need to check if the Threat Detection feature is enabled. You can do this using the `sql_client.servers.get_threat_detection_policy()` method. Here's an example:

```
for server in servers:
    policy = sql_client.servers.get_threat_detection_policy(server.resource_group, server.name)
    if not policy.state:
        # Threat Detection is disabled, enable it
        policy.state = 'Enabled'
        sql_client.servers.create_or_update_threat_detection_policy(server.resource_group, server.name, policy)
```

4. Finally, you need to create an Azure Monitor alert to notify you when Threat Detection is disabled for a SQL server. You can do this using the `azure.mgmt.monitor` package. Here's an example:

```
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import AlertRuleResource, AlertRuleAllOfCondition, \
    AlertRuleAllOfAction, AlertRuleActionGroup

monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Create an action group for the alert
action_group = AlertRuleActionGroup(
    group_id='<your-action-group-id>',
    webhook_properties={}
)

# Create the alert rule
alert_rule = AlertRuleResource(
    name='Threat Detection Disabled',
    location='<your-location>',
    description='Alert when Threat Detection is disabled for a SQL server',
    condition=AlertRuleAllOfCondition(
        all_of=[
            {
                "field": "category",
                "equals": "Administrative"
            },
            {
                "field": "resourceId",
                "contains": "/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/"
            },
            {
                "field": "resourceStatus",
                "equals": "Disabled"
            }
        ]
    ),
    actions=AlertRuleAllOfAction(
        all_of=[action_group]
    )
)

monitor_client.alert_rules.create_or_update('<your-resource-group>', '<your-alert-rule-name>', alert_rule)
```

These are the steps to remediate the "Threat Detection Alerts Disabled for SQL Servers" misconfiguration in Azure using Python.
