### More Info:

TDE with Customer-managed key support provides increased transparency and control over the TDE Protector, increased security with an HSM-backed external service, and promotion of separation of duties. With TDE, data is encrypted at rest with a symmetric key (called the database encryption key) stored in the database or data warehouse distribution. To protect this data encryption key (DEK) in the past, only a certificate that the Azure SQL Service managed could be used. Now, with Customer-managed key support for TDE, the DEK can be protected with an asymmetric key that is stored in the Key Vault. Key Vault is a highly available and scalable cloud-based key store which offers central key management, leverages FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated hardware security modules (HSMs), and allows separation of management of keys and data, for additional security.

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to the SQL servers section: In the left-hand menu, click on "SQL servers" under the "Databases" section. This will bring up a list of all your SQL servers.

2. Select the SQL server you want to check: Click on the name of the SQL server you want to check for the TDE Protector encryption configuration. This will bring up the server's dashboard.

3. Navigate to the "Transparent Data Encryption" section: In the server dashboard, click on "Transparent Data Encryption" under the "Security" section. This will bring up the TDE configuration page.

4. Check the TDE Protector encryption status: On the TDE configuration page, look for the "Data Encryption" section. If the "Key" is set to "Service Managed", then the TDE Protector is not encrypted with a Customer Managed Key (CMK). If it is set to a specific key, then it is encrypted with a CMK.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft website. Once installed, open your command prompt and type `az` to ensure it's installed correctly.

2. Login to Azure Account: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be redirected to the browser for login. Enter your credentials and login.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. List all SQL Servers: Use the following command to list all the SQL servers in your Azure account. This will return a list of all SQL servers with their details.
   ```
   az sql server list --query "[].{name:name, resourceGroup:resourceGroup}"
   ```
4. Check TDE Protector Encryption: For each SQL server, check the encryption protector. If it's encrypted with a service-managed key, it will return 'service'. If it's encrypted with a customer-managed key, it will return 'azurekeyvault'. Use the following command to check the encryption protector.
   ```
   az sql server tde-key show --name {SQL Server Name} --resource-group {Resource Group Name} --query "uri"
   ```
   Replace `{SQL Server Name}` and `{Resource Group Name}` with your actual SQL Server name and resource group name. If the output is not 'azurekeyvault', then the SQL Server TDE Protector is not encrypted with CMK.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You can use pip to install these libraries. The libraries you need are `azure-mgmt-sql` and `azure-identity` for Azure, `boto3` for AWS, and `google-cloud-sql` for GCP.

   ```python
   pip install azure-mgmt-sql azure-identity boto3 google-cloud-sql
   ```

2. Create a Python script to connect to the cloud service: You need to create a Python script that connects to the cloud service and retrieves the configuration of the SQL Server. Here is an example for Azure:

   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
   sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

   server_name = 'your-server-name'
   resource_group = 'your-resource-group'

   server = sql_client.servers.get(resource_group, server_name)
   ```

3. Check the TDE Protector configuration: Once you have the server configuration, you can check the TDE Protector configuration. Here is an example for Azure:

   ```python
   tde_protector = sql_client.transparent_data_encryptions.get(resource_group, server_name)

   if tde_protector.status == 'Enabled' and tde_protector.encryption_protector_type == 'ServiceManaged':
       print('TDE Protector is not encrypted with CMK')
   else:
       print('TDE Protector is encrypted with CMK')
   ```

4. Repeat for all servers: You need to repeat these steps for all servers in your cloud service. You can use a loop to iterate over all servers. Here is an example for Azure:

   ```python
   for server in sql_client.servers.list():
       server_name = server.name
       resource_group = server.resource_group

       server = sql_client.servers.get(resource_group, server_name)
       tde_protector = sql_client.transparent_data_encryptions.get(resource_group, server_name)

       if tde_protector.status == 'Enabled' and tde_protector.encryption_protector_type == 'ServiceManaged':
           print(f'TDE Protector for server {server_name} is not encrypted with CMK')
       else:
           print(f'TDE Protector for server {server_name} is encrypted with CMK')
   ```

Please replace 'your-subscription-id', 'your-server-name', and 'your-resource-group' with your actual Azure subscription ID, server name, and resource group name. For AWS and GCP, you would need to use their respective SDKs (`boto3` for AWS and `google-cloud-sql` for GCP) and follow a similar process.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure SQL Server TDE Protector Is Encrypted With CMK" in Azure, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Azure portal and navigate to the Azure SQL database that you want to remediate.

2. Click on the "Transparent data encryption" option under the Security section on the left-hand side menu.

3. In the "Transparent data encryption" blade, check if the "TDE Protector" is set to "Service Managed". If it is set to "Service Managed", then it means that the TDE protector is not encrypted with a customer-managed key (CMK).

4. To encrypt the TDE protector with a CMK, click on the "Set" button next to the "TDE Protector" option.

5. In the "Set TDE Protector" blade, select the "Customer-managed key" option and choose the CMK that you want to use to encrypt the TDE protector.

6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

7. Once the changes are saved, the TDE protector will be encrypted with the selected CMK.

8. Verify the remediation by checking the "Transparent data encryption" blade again and ensure that the "TDE Protector" is now set to "Customer-managed key".
