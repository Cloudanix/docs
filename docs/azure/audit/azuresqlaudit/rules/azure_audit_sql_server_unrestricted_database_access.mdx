### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Navigate to SQL servers: From the left-hand menu, select "SQL servers" under the "Databases" section. This will display a list of all SQL servers in your Azure environment.

3. Check firewall settings: For each SQL server, click on the server name to open its dashboard. From the server dashboard, select "Firewalls and virtual networks" under the "Security" section. This will display the firewall settings for the selected SQL server.

4. Check for unrestricted access: In the firewall settings, look for any rules that have the "Start IP" set to 0.0.0.0 and the "End IP" set to 255.255.255.255. This indicates that the SQL server is accessible from any IP address, which means it has unrestricted access. If such a rule exists, the SQL server is misconfigured.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal and type `az login` to log in to your Azure account.

2. List SQL Servers: Use the following command to list all the SQL servers in your Azure account. This will return a list of all SQL servers along with their properties.
    ```
    az sql server list
    ```
3. Check Firewall Rules: For each SQL server, you need to check the firewall rules to see if they allow unrestricted access. Use the following command to list all firewall rules for a specific SQL server. Replace `<server-name>` and `<resource-group-name>` with your SQL server name and resource group name respectively.
    ```
    az sql server firewall-rule list --server <server-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>
    ```
4. Analyze Firewall Rules: The above command will return a list of all firewall rules along with their properties. Look at the `startIpAddress` and `endIpAddress` properties of each rule. If any rule has `startIpAddress` as `0.0.0.0` and `endIpAddress` as `255.255.255.255`, it means that the SQL server has unrestricted access.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You will need the 'azure-mgmt-sql' library to interact with Azure SQL databases. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install azure-mgmt-sql
```

2. Authenticate with Azure: The next step is to authenticate with Azure. You can do this using the 'ServicePrincipalCredentials' class from the 'azure.common.credentials' module. You will need to provide your tenant ID, client ID, and client secret.

```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    tenant=YOUR_TENANT_ID,
    client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID,
    secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET,
)
```

3. Get a list of all SQL servers: Now that you are authenticated, you can get a list of all SQL servers in your subscription. You can do this using the 'SqlManagementClient' class from the 'azure.mgmt.sql' module.

```python
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient

sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credentials, YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID)
servers = sql_client.servers.list()
```

4. Check each server for unrestricted access: Finally, you can check each server for unrestricted access. You can do this by checking the 'firewall_rules' property of each server. If a rule allows access from '0.0.0.0' to '0.0.0.0', then the server has unrestricted access.

```python
for server in servers:
    firewall_rules = sql_client.firewall_rules.list_by_server(server.resource_group, server.name)
    for rule in firewall_rules:
        if rule.start_ip_address == '0.0.0.0' and rule.end_ip_address == '0.0.0.0':
            print(f'Server {server.name} has unrestricted access')
```

This script will print the names of all servers that have unrestricted access.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "SQL Database Servers Should Not Have Unrestricted Access" in AZURE using AZURE console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to the SQL database server that has unrestricted access.
3. Click on the "Firewalls and virtual networks" option under the "Security" section in the left-hand menu.
4. Under the "Firewall rules" section, click on the "Add client IP" button to add your IP address to the allowed list.
5. If you want to allow access to specific IP addresses or ranges, click on the "Add IP range" button and enter the appropriate information.
6. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "SQL Database Servers Should Not Have Unrestricted Access" in AZURE using AZURE console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "SQL Database Servers Should Not Have Unrestricted Access" in Azure using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI and login to your Azure account.
2. Identify the SQL Database Server that has unrestricted access by running the following command:
   ```
   az sql server list
   ```
   This will list all the SQL Database Servers in your Azure account.
3. Once you have identified the SQL Database Server, run the following command to update the firewall rules:
   ```
   az sql server firewall-rule update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <server-name> --name AllowAllWindowsAzureIps --start-ip-address 0.0.0.0 --end-ip-address 0.0.0.0
   ```
   This command will update the firewall rule named "AllowAllWindowsAzureIps" to restrict access to the SQL Database Server to only Azure services and resources.
4. Verify that the firewall rule has been updated by running the following command:
   ```
   az sql server firewall-rule show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <server-name> --name AllowAllWindowsAzureIps
   ```
   This command will show the details of the updated firewall rule.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "SQL Database Servers Should Not Have Unrestricted Access" in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "SQL Database Servers Should Not Have Unrestricted Access" in Azure using Python, you can use the following steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries and authenticate to Azure using the Azure SDK for Python.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = '<your-subscription-id>'

resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

2. Retrieve the list of SQL servers in your subscription.

```python
servers = sql_client.servers.list()
```

3. For each SQL server, check if it has any firewall rules that allow unrestricted access.

```python
for server in servers:
    firewall_rules = sql_client.firewall_rules.list_by_server(server.resource_group, server.name)
    for rule in firewall_rules:
        if rule.start_ip_address == '0.0.0.0' and rule.end_ip_address == '255.255.255.255':
            # This firewall rule allows unrestricted access, so delete it
            sql_client.firewall_rules.delete(server.resource_group, server.name, rule.name)
```

4. Once all the firewall rules have been deleted, you can verify that the SQL servers no longer have unrestricted access.

```python
for server in servers:
    firewall_rules = sql_client.firewall_rules.list_by_server(server.resource_group, server.name)
    for rule in firewall_rules:
        if rule.start_ip_address == '0.0.0.0' and rule.end_ip_address == '255.255.255.255':
            print(f"Server {server.name} still has a firewall rule that allows unrestricted access.")
        else:
            print(f"Server {server.name} has no firewall rules that allow unrestricted access.")
```

These steps will remediate the misconfiguration "SQL Database Servers Should Not Have Unrestricted Access" in Azure using Python.
