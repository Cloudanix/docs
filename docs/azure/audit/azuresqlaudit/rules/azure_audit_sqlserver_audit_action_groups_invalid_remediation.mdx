#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of AuditActionGroups in auditing for AZURE using AZURE CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AZURE CLI on your local machine or use the AZURE Cloud Shell.
2. Run the following command to get the current configuration of AuditActionGroups:

   ```
   az monitor activity-log list --query [].categories.actionGroups
   ```

3. Check the output of the above command to see if AuditActionGroups are set properly. If not, proceed to the next step.
4. Run the following command to set the AuditActionGroups:

   ```
   az monitor activity-log update --set categories.actionGroups=<comma separated list of action groups>
   ```

   Replace `<comma separated list of action groups>` with the appropriate list of action groups. For example, if you want to set the AuditActionGroups to "Write", "Delete", and "Action", the command would be:

   ```
   az monitor activity-log update --set categories.actionGroups=Write,Delete,Action
   ```

5. Verify the configuration by running the first command again:

   ```
   az monitor activity-log list --query [].categories.actionGroups
   ```

   The output should now show the updated list of AuditActionGroups.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of AuditActionGroups in auditing for AZURE using AZURE CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of AuditActionGroups in Azure using Python, follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
```

2. Set the credentials:

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = '<Your Subscription ID>'
```

3. Initialize the MonitorManagementClient:

```python
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

4. Get the existing AuditActionGroups:

```python
audit_action_groups = monitor_client.activity_log_alerts.list_action_groups(resource_group_name='<Your Resource Group Name>', action_group_name='<Your Action Group Name>')
```

5. Update the AuditActionGroups:

```python
updated_audit_action_groups = [
    {
        "id": "/subscriptions/<Your Subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<Your Resource Group Name>/providers/microsoft.insights/actionGroups/<Your Action Group Name>",
        "action_group_type": "CustomEmail/SMS/Push/Voice",
        "short_name": "<Your Short Name>",
        "email_receivers": [
            {
                "name": "<Your Email Name>",
                "email_address": "<Your Email Address>",
                "use_common_alert_schema": True
            }
        ]
    }
]

monitor_client.action_groups.create_or_update(resource_group_name='<Your Resource Group Name>', action_group_name='<Your Action Group Name>', parameters=updated_audit_action_groups)
```

6. Verify the updated AuditActionGroups:

```python
updated_audit_action_groups = monitor_client.activity_log_alerts.list_action_groups(resource_group_name='<Your Resource Group Name>', action_group_name='<Your Action Group Name>')
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of AuditActionGroups in Azure using Python.
