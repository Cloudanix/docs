### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal by entering "https://portal.azure.com" in your web browser's address bar. Enter your Azure account credentials to log in.

2. Navigate to SQL servers: Once you're logged in, click on the hamburger icon (three horizontal lines) in the top left corner of the Azure portal. This will open the navigation pane. Scroll down and click on "SQL servers" under the "Databases" section.

3. Select the SQL server: In the SQL servers pane, you will see a list of all the SQL servers in your Azure account. Click on the name of the SQL server for which you want to check the Threat Detection Retention Period.

4. Check Threat Detection settings: After selecting the SQL server, a new pane will open on the right. In this pane, click on "Security" in the left-hand menu, then select "Advanced Threat Protection". Here, you can see the Threat Detection Retention Period for the selected SQL server.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal and type `az login` to log in to your Azure account.

2. List SQL Servers: Use the following command to list all the SQL servers in your Azure account. This will return a list of all SQL servers along with their properties.
    ```
    az sql server list --resource-group <resource-group-name>
    ```
   Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of your resource group.

3. Get Threat Detection Policy: For each SQL server, you can get the threat detection policy which includes the retention period. Use the following command to get the threat detection policy for a specific SQL server.
    ```
    az sql server threat-policy show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <server-name>
    ```
   Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of your resource group and `<server-name>` with the name of your SQL server.

4. Check Retention Period: In the output of the above command, look for the `retentionDays` property. This property indicates the number of days the threat detection logs are retained. If this value is less than the recommended value (e.g., 90 days), then it is a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with Azure resources, you need to install the Azure SDK for Python. You can do this using pip:

   ```python
   pip install azure-mgmt-sql
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules and set up Azure credentials: You need to import the necessary modules and set up your Azure credentials. You can do this by setting the AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID environment variable and using the DefaultAzureCredential class from the azure.identity module.

   ```python
   import os
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient

   subscription_id = os.getenv('AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID')
   credentials = DefaultAzureCredential()
   sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
   ```

3. List all SQL servers and check their Threat Detection settings: You can use the sql_client.servers.list() method to get a list of all SQL servers in your subscription. For each server, you can use the sql_client.server_azure_ad_administrators.get() method to get the Threat Detection settings. If the retention_days property is less than 90, then the server has a short Threat Detection retention period.

   ```python
   for server in sql_client.servers.list():
       threat_detection_policy = sql_client.server_azure_ad_administrators.get(server.resource_group, server.name)
       if threat_detection_policy.retention_days < 90:
           print(f"Server {server.name} has a short Threat Detection retention period.")
   ```

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run the script to check all your SQL servers. If any servers have a short Threat Detection retention period, they will be printed to the console. This allows you to easily identify any misconfigurations.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration of a short threat detection retention period for SQL Servers in Azure:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. In the left-hand menu, click on "SQL servers".
3. Select the SQL server you want to remediate.
4. In the left-hand menu of the SQL server page, click on "Advanced Data Security".
5. On the Advanced Data Security page, click on the "Settings" tab.
6. Scroll down to the "Data retention" section.
7. Increase the retention period to the desired value (e.g. 90 days).
8. Click on the "Save" button at the top of the page to save the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, your SQL server will have a longer threat detection retention period. This will allow you to detect and investigate security threats over a longer period of time, improving your overall security posture.

#### Using CLI

Short Threat Detection Retention Period for SQL Servers means that the logs for threat detection are not being retained for a sufficient period of time. This can make it difficult to detect and investigate security incidents. To remediate this issue for Azure SQL Servers using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open Azure CLI and log in to your Azure account.

2. Run the following command to set the retention period for threat detection logs:

   ```
   az sql db threat-policy update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <server-name> --database <database-name> --retention-day <number-of-days>
   ```

   Replace `<resource-group-name>`, `<server-name>`, `<database-name>` and `<number-of-days>` with the appropriate values for your environment.

   For example, if you want to set the retention period to 30 days for a database named "mydatabase" on a server named "myserver" in a resource group named "myresourcegroup", you would run the following command:

   ```
   az sql db threat-policy update --resource-group myresourcegroup --server myserver --database mydatabase --retention-day 30
   ```

3. Wait for the command to complete. This may take a few minutes.

4. Verify that the retention period has been set correctly by running the following command:

   ```
   az sql db threat-policy show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <server-name> --database <database-name>
   ```

   This command will display the current threat detection policy for the specified database. Verify that the "retentionDays" property is set to the value you specified in step 2.

By following these steps, you can remediate the short threat detection retention period for Azure SQL Servers using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

The remediation process for this misconfiguration involves increasing the threat detection retention period for SQL Servers in AZURE using Python. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this issue:

1. First, you need to install the `azure-mgmt-monitor` and `azure-common` Python packages. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-monitor azure-common
   ```

2. Next, you need to authenticate to your AZURE account using the `ServicePrincipalCredentials` class from the `azure.common.credentials` package. You will need to provide your AZURE subscription ID, client ID, client secret, and tenant ID. Here's an example:

   ```python
   from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

   subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
   client_id = 'your-client-id'
   client_secret = 'your-client-secret'
   tenant_id = 'your-tenant-id'

   credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
       client_id=client_id,
       secret=client_secret,
       tenant=tenant_id
   )
   ```

3. Once you have authenticated, you can use the `MonitorManagementClient` class from the `azure.mgmt.monitor` package to update the threat detection retention period for your SQL Servers. You will need to provide the name of your AZURE resource group, the name of your SQL Server, and the new retention period in days. Here's an example:

   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
   from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import DiagnosticSettingsResource

   resource_group_name = 'your-resource-group-name'
   server_name = 'your-sql-server-name'
   retention_days = 90

   client = MonitorManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)

   settings = DiagnosticSettingsResource(
       storage_account_id=None,
       workspace_id=None,
       metrics=None,
       logs=[{
           'category': 'SQLSecurityAuditEvents',
           'enabled': True,
           'retentionPolicy': {
               'days': retention_days,
               'enabled': True
           }
       }]
   )

   client.diagnostic_settings.create_or_update(
       resource_group_name=resource_group_name,
       resource_uri=f'/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group_name}/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/{server_name}',
       parameters=settings
   )
   ```

4. Finally, you can run the Python script to update the threat detection retention period for your SQL Servers in AZURE.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of short threat detection retention period for SQL Servers in AZURE using Python.
