### More Info:

Restricting Unstrusted Workloads Can Be Achieved By Using Aci Along With Aks. What Is Aci? Aci Lets You Quickly Deploy Container Instances Without Additional Infrastructure Overhead. When You Connect With Aks, Aci Becomes A Secured, Logical Extension Of Your Aks Cluster. The Virtual Nodes Component, Which Is Based On Virtual Kubelet, Is Installed In Your Aks Cluster That Presents Aci As A Virtual Kubernetes Node. Kubernetes Can Then Schedule Pods That Run As Aci Instances Through Virtual Nodes, Not As Pods On Vm Nodes Directly In Your Aks Cluster.
