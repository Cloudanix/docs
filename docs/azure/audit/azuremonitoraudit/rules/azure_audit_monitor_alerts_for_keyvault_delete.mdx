### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to the Monitor service. 

2. In the Monitor service, go to the "Alerts" section. Here, you can create and manage alert rules. Click on "New alert rule".

3. In the "Create rule" interface, you need to specify the target resource for which you want to set up the alert. This should be the Key Vault for which you want to monitor delete events. 

4. In the condition, select the "Event" signal type. In the event category, select "Administrative" and then in the event type, select "Delete Key Vault". This will set up an alert for any delete key vault events. 

Remember, you also need to specify the action group which will be notified when the alert is triggered.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use the Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local system. You can download it from the official Azure website and install it based on your operating system.

2. Login to Azure Account: After installing Azure CLI, open your command prompt or terminal and login to your Azure account using the following command:
   ```
   az login
   ```
   This command will open a new window in your web browser asking for your Azure credentials. After successful login, the terminal will display your subscriptions.

3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, select the subscription where the Key Vault resides using the following command:
   ```
   az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"
   ```
   Replace "your-subscription-id" with your actual Azure subscription ID.

4. Check for Alerts: Now, you can check for the setup alerts for delete Key Vault events using the following command:
   ```
   az monitor activity-log alert list --resource-group "your-resource-group"
   ```
   Replace "your-resource-group" with the name of your resource group. This command will list all the alerts set up in the specified resource group. You can look for the alerts related to the deletion of Key Vault events in the output.

#### Using Python

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: The first step is to import the necessary libraries in your Python script. You will need the Azure SDK for Python to interact with Azure resources. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install azure-mgmt-monitor
```
Then, import the necessary modules in your script:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import RuleCondition, RuleAction, RuleDataSource, ActivityLogAlert
```

2. **Authenticate and Initialize Monitor Management Client**: The next step is to authenticate to your Azure account and initialize the Monitor Management Client. This client will be used to interact with Azure Monitor and set up alerts.

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'  # replace with your Azure subscription ID
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

3. **Define Alert Criteria**: Now, you need to define the criteria for the alert. In this case, you want to set up an alert for Delete Key Vault events. You can do this by creating a RuleCondition object:

```python
condition = RuleCondition(
    field="operationName",
    equals="Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/delete"
)
```

4. **Check for Existing Alerts**: Finally, you can check for existing alerts that match your criteria. You can do this by calling the list_by_subscription_id method on the monitor_client object and filtering the results:

```python
alerts = monitor_client.activity_log_alerts.list_by_subscription_id()

for alert in alerts:
    if alert.condition == condition:
        print(f"Alert for Delete Key Vault events already exists: {alert.name}")
```

This script will print the names of any existing alerts that match the specified condition. If no such alerts exist, it will not print anything.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "Setup Alerts for Delete Key Vault Events" for Azure using the Azure console:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (portal.azure.com) using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the Key Vaults service in the Azure portal.
3. Select the Key Vault for which you want to set up the alerts.
4. In the Key Vault menu, select "Monitoring" under the "Settings" section.
5. Click on "Alerts" and then click on "New alert rule".
6. In the "Create rule" page, select "Key Vault" as the resource type and then select the specific Key Vault for which you want to set up the alerts.
7. Select the "Delete" event type under the "Event type" section.
8. Set the appropriate threshold and frequency for the alert rule.
9. In the "Actions" section, click on "Add action group" to create a new action group.
10. In the "Create action group" page, enter the required details such as the name of the action group, the email address or phone number to receive the alerts, and the severity level of the alerts.
11. Click on "Create" to create the action group, and then click on "OK" to close the "Create rule" page.
12. Your alert rule is now set up, and you will receive an alert whenever a delete event occurs in the specified Key Vault.

That's it! You have successfully set up alerts for delete Key Vault events in Azure using the Azure console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Setup Alerts for Delete Key Vault Events" in Azure using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI on your local machine or in the Azure portal.

2. Login to your Azure account using the following command:

   ```
   az login
   ```

3. Once you have successfully logged in, set the default subscription to the one you want to work with using the following command:

   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
   ```

4. Create an Azure Monitor action group that will be used to send notifications when a Key Vault is deleted. Use the following command to create an action group:

   ```
   az monitor action-group create --name <action_group_name> --short-name <short_name> --email <email_address> --webhook-properties "uri=<webhook_url>"
   ```

   Replace `<action_group_name>` with a name for the action group, `<short_name>` with a short name for the action group, `<email_address>` with an email address to receive notifications, and `<webhook_url>` with the URL of the webhook to receive notifications.

5. Create an Azure Monitor alert rule that will trigger when a Key Vault is deleted. Use the following command to create an alert rule:

   ```
   az monitor metrics alert create --name <alert_rule_name> --description <description> --resource <resource_id> --condition "metricName=DeletedVaults Count Total and aggregation=Total and threshold=1" --action <action_group_name>
   ```

   Replace `<alert_rule_name>` with a name for the alert rule, `<description>` with a description for the alert rule, `<resource_id>` with the ID of the resource to monitor, and `<action_group_name>` with the name of the action group created in step 4.

6. Verify that the alert rule has been created using the following command:

   ```
   az monitor metrics alert show --name <alert_rule_name> --resource <resource_id>
   ```

7. Test the alert rule by deleting a Key Vault and verifying that a notification is received.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration "Setup Alerts for Delete Key Vault Events" in Azure using Azure CLI.
