### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Open your web browser, navigate to the Azure portal and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Navigate to Monitor: On the left-hand side menu, click on "Monitor". This will open the Monitor blade where you can view and manage all your monitoring settings.

3. Check Activity Log Alerts: In the Monitor blade, click on "Alerts" and then select "Manage alert rules". This will open a list of all your existing alert rules. Look for an alert rule that is set up for "Create Policy Assignment" events.

4. Verify Alert Details: Click on the alert rule to view its details. Make sure that the rule is set to trigger an alert for "Create Policy Assignment" events. The alert rule should also be enabled and properly configured to notify the appropriate individuals or teams when such an event occurs.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal and type `az login` to log in to your Azure account.

2. List Existing Activity Log Alerts: Use the following command to list all the existing activity log alerts in your Azure account:

    ```
    az monitor activity-log alert list --resource-group {resource-group-name}
    ```
    Replace `{resource-group-name}` with the name of your resource group. This command will return a list of all the activity log alerts in the specified resource group.

3. Check for Create Policy Assignment Alert: Look through the list of activity log alerts for an alert that monitors the creation of policy assignments. The alert's condition field should look something like this:

    ```
    "condition": {
        "allOf": [
            {
                "field": "operationName",
                "equals": "Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    This condition indicates that the alert is triggered whenever a policy assignment is created.

4. Verify Alert Status: Ensure that the alert is enabled and properly configured to notify the appropriate parties when triggered. The alert's `enabled` field should be set to `true`, and the `actions` field should include all the necessary actions to take when the alert is triggered.

#### Using Python

To check if an Activity Log Alert exists for Create Policy Assignment in Azure Monitoring using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Azure SDK for Python**: Azure SDK for Python is a set of libraries that allow you to work with Azure services like Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, etc. You can install it using pip:
   ```python
   pip install azure-mgmt-monitor
   ```
2. **Authenticate to Azure**: Before you can interact with Azure services, you need to authenticate. You can use Azure Identity library for Python to authenticate:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   ```
3. **Create Monitor Management Client**: After authenticating, you can create a Monitor Management client. This client will allow you to interact with Azure Monitor service:
   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
   monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, "<your-subscription-id>")
   ```
4. **Check for Activity Log Alert**: Now you can use the Monitor Management client to check if an Activity Log Alert exists for Create Policy Assignment. You can filter the alerts based on the category "Administrative" and the operation name "Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write":
   ```python
   activity_log_alerts = monitor_client.activity_log_alerts.list()
   for alert in activity_log_alerts:
       if alert.condition.all_of[0].field == "category" and alert.condition.all_of[0].equals == "Administrative":
           if alert.condition.all_of[1].field == "operationName" and alert.condition.all_of[1].equals == "Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write":
               print(f"Activity Log Alert exists for Create Policy Assignment: {alert.name}")
   ```
This script will print the name of the Activity Log Alert if it exists for Create Policy Assignment. If it doesn't print anything, it means the alert doesn't exist.
