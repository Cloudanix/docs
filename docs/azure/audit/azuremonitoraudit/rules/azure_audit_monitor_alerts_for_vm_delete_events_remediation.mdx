### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to the "Monitor" service. 

2. In the Monitor service, go to the "Activity Log". This is where you can view all the events that happen in your Azure resources.

3. In the Activity Log, filter the events by the category "Administrative" and the operation name "Delete Virtual Machine". This will show you all the events where a virtual machine was deleted.

4. To set up an alert for this event, click on "New Alert Rule". In the "Condition" field, select the "Activity Log - Administrative" signal and set the "Operation Name" to "Delete Virtual Machine". Then, specify the action group to be notified when this event occurs.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt and type `az login` to log in to your Azure account.

2. Check Existing Alerts: To check if there are any existing alerts for Delete Virtual Machine events, use the following command:

   ```
   az monitor activity-log alert list --resource-group MyResourceGroup
   ```
   Replace 'MyResourceGroup' with the name of your resource group. This command will list all the alerts in the specified resource group.

3. Check Alert Details: If there are existing alerts, you can check their details using the following command:

   ```
   az monitor activity-log alert show --name MyAlertName --resource-group MyResourceGroup
   ```
   Replace 'MyAlertName' with the name of your alert and 'MyResourceGroup' with the name of your resource group. This command will show the details of the specified alert.

4. Check Alert Rules: To check if there are any rules set for Delete Virtual Machine events, use the following command:

   ```
   az monitor activity-log alert action-group list --name MyAlertName --resource-group MyResourceGroup
   ```
   Replace 'MyAlertName' with the name of your alert and 'MyResourceGroup' with the name of your resource group. This command will list all the action groups associated with the specified alert. If there are any rules set for Delete Virtual Machine events, they will be listed here.

#### Using Python

1. **Install the necessary libraries**: Before you start, you need to install the necessary libraries. You can use the pip package manager to install the Azure SDK for Python. The Azure SDK for Python is a set of libraries that allow you to work with Azure services like Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, etc. You can install it using the following command:

```python
pip install azure-mgmt-monitor
```

2. **Authenticate and create a monitor management client**: To interact with Azure services, you need to authenticate your application. You can authenticate using a service principal or managed identity. Once you have the credentials, you can create a monitor management client.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

3. **List the activity logs**: You can use the `activity_logs` property of the monitor management client to list the activity logs. You can filter the logs by event name to only get the delete virtual machine events.

```python
from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import EventData

filter_string = "eventTimestamp ge '2021-01-01T00:00:00Z' and eventTimestamp le '2021-12-31T23:59:59Z' and eventName eq 'Delete Virtual Machine'"
select_string = "eventName, eventTimestamp"

activity_logs = monitor_client.activity_logs.list(
    filter=filter_string,
    select=select_string
)

for log in activity_logs:
    print(log.event_name.localized_value, log.event_timestamp)
```

4. **Set up alerts**: You can use the `alert_rules` property of the monitor management client to create an alert rule. The alert rule can be configured to send an email or call a webhook when a delete virtual machine event is detected.

```python
from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import AlertRuleResource

alert_rule = AlertRuleResource(
    location='Global',
    actions=[
        {
            'actionGroupId': '/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Insights/actionGroups/{actionGroupName}',
            'webhookProperties': {
                'key1': 'value1',
                'key2': 'value2'
            }
        }
    ],
    condition={
        'allOf': [
            {
                'field': 'eventName',
                'equals': 'Delete Virtual Machine'
            }
        ]
    },
    description='Alert rule for delete virtual machine events',
    enabled=True,
    severity=0,
    scopes=['/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}'],
    tags={
        'key1': 'value1',
        'key2': 'value2'
    }
)

monitor_client.alert_rules.create_or_update(
    resource_group_name='your-resource-group',
    rule_name='your-alert-rule',
    parameters=alert_rule
)
```

This script will create an alert rule that sends an alert whenever a delete virtual machine event is detected.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate misconfiguration of not having alerts set up for delete virtual machine events in Azure:

1. Login to Azure portal using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the "Virtual Machines" blade from the left-hand side menu.
3. Select the virtual machine for which you want to set up alerts for delete events.
4. Under the "Monitoring" section, select "Alerts" and click on the "New alert rule" button.
5. In the "New alert rule" page, select the "Signal logic" tab.
6. In the "Signal logic" tab, select "Virtual machines" from the "Resource type" drop-down menu.
7. Select "Delete" from the "Signal name" drop-down menu.
8. Set the "Aggregation type" to "Count".
9. Set the "Threshold value" to "1".
10. Set the "Evaluation frequency" to "5 minutes".
11. In the "Actions" tab, select "Add action group".
12. In the "Add action group" page, click on the "Create action group" button.
13. In the "Create action group" page, provide a name for the action group.
14. Select "Email/SMS/Push/Voice" as the "Action type".
15. Enter the email address or phone number in the "Email/SMS/Push/Voice details" field.
16. Click on the "OK" button to create the action group.
17. Select the newly created action group from the "Actions" tab.
18. Click on the "Create alert rule" button to save the alert rule.

With these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of not having alerts set up for delete virtual machine events in Azure. Now, you will receive an email or SMS notification whenever a virtual machine is deleted in your Azure environment.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Setup Alerts for Delete Virtual Machine Events" in AZURE using AZURE CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AZURE CLI on your system.
2. Run the following command to create a new action group for the alerts:

   ```
   az monitor action-group create --name <action-group-name> --short-name <short-name> --email <email-address> --sms <phone-number>
   ```

   Replace `<action-group-name>` with a name for the action group, `<short-name>` with a short name for the action group, `<email-address>` with the email address to receive alerts, and `<phone-number>` with the phone number to receive alerts.

3. Run the following command to create a new alert rule:

   ```
   az monitor metrics alert create --name <alert-rule-name> --description <description> --resource <resource-id> --metric "Percentage CPU" --operator GreaterThan --threshold 90 --time-aggregation Average --evaluation-frequency 5 --actions <action-group-name>
   ```

   Replace `<alert-rule-name>` with a name for the alert rule, `<description>` with a description for the alert rule, `<resource-id>` with the ID of the resource to monitor (e.g. virtual machine), and `<action-group-name>` with the name of the action group created in step 2.

4. Run the following command to verify the alert rule:

   ```
   az monitor metrics alert show --name <alert-rule-name> --resource <resource-id>
   ```

   Replace `<alert-rule-name>` with the name of the alert rule created in step 3 and `<resource-id>` with the ID of the resource to monitor.

With these steps, you have successfully set up alerts for delete virtual machine events in AZURE using AZURE CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of not having alerts set up for delete virtual machine events in Azure, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using the following command:

   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-monitor
   ```

2. Authenticate to your Azure account using the Azure CLI or by providing a Service Principal.

3. Create a new alert rule using the `azure-mgmt-monitor` package. The following code snippet demonstrates how to create an alert rule for delete virtual machine events:

   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
   from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import (AlertRuleResource, Condition, 
                                           RuleMetricDataSource, RuleMetricDimension)

   # Replace with your own values
   RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME = 'my-resource-group'
   VM_NAME = 'my-vm'
   ALERT_NAME = 'vm-delete-alert'
   ACTION_GROUP_ID = '/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/microsoft.insights/actionGroups/<action-group-name>'

   # Create the rule condition
   condition = Condition(
       metric_name='SuccessfulCalls',
       metric_namespace='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines',
       operator='==',
       threshold='0',
       time_aggregation='Total',
       dimensions=[
           RuleMetricDimension(name='ResourceId', value=f"/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/{RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{VM_NAME}")
       ]
   )

   # Create the rule data source
   data_source = RuleMetricDataSource(
       resource_uri=f"/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/{RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{VM_NAME}",
       metric_name='SuccessfulCalls',
       metric_namespace='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines'
   )

   # Create the alert rule
   alert_rule = AlertRuleResource(
       name=ALERT_NAME,
       description='Alert for virtual machine delete events',
       is_enabled=True,
       condition=condition,
       actions=[
           {
               'action_group_id': ACTION_GROUP_ID
           }
       ],
       data_source=data_source
   )

   # Create the MonitorManagementClient and create the alert rule
   monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
   monitor_client.alert_rules.create_or_update(
       RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME,
       ALERT_NAME,
       alert_rule
   )
   ```

4. Replace the placeholders in the code snippet with your own values, such as the resource group name, virtual machine name, alert name, and action group ID.

5. Run the Python script to create the alert rule.

With these steps, you should have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of not having alerts set up for delete virtual machine events in Azure.
