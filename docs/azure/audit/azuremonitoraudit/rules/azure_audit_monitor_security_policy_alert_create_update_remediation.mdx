### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Open your web browser, navigate to the Azure portal and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Navigate to Monitor: On the left-hand side menu, click on "Monitor". This will open the Monitor blade where you can view and manage all your monitoring settings.

3. Check Activity Log Alerts: In the Monitor blade, click on "Alerts" and then select "Manage alert rules". This will open a list of all your existing alert rules. Look for any alert rules that are set up to trigger when a "Create or Update Security Policy" event occurs.

4. Verify Alert Details: Click on the specific alert rule to view its details. Make sure that the "Action Group" is set to send notifications to the appropriate recipients, and that the "Condition" is set to trigger the alert when a "Create or Update Security Policy" event is logged in the Activity Log.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal and type `az login` to log in to your Azure account.

2. List Activity Log Alerts: Use the following command to list all the activity log alerts in your Azure account. This command will return a list of all the activity log alerts along with their details.

    ```
    az monitor activity-log alert list
    ```
   
3. Filter Activity Log Alerts: Now, you need to filter out the activity log alerts for 'Create or Update Security Policy'. You can do this by piping the output of the previous command to a grep command as shown below:

    ```
    az monitor activity-log alert list | grep "Create or Update Security Policy"
    ```
   
4. Check Existence: If the above command returns any output, it means that an activity log alert exists for 'Create or Update Security Policy'. If it doesn't return any output, it means that no such alert exists.

#### Using Python

To check if an Activity Log Alert exists for Create or Update Security Policy in Azure Monitoring using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Setup Azure SDK for Python**: First, you need to install the Azure SDK for Python. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-monitor
   ```
   This will install the Azure Monitor SDK which you can use to interact with Azure Monitor.

2. **Authenticate with Azure**: Before you can interact with Azure, you need to authenticate. You can do this using Azure Identity library. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'  # replace with your Azure Subscription ID
   client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
   ```

3. **List all Activity Log Alerts**: Now, you can list all the Activity Log Alerts in your subscription. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   alerts = client.activity_log_alerts.list_by_subscription_id()

   for alert in alerts:
       print(alert.name)
   ```
   This will print the names of all the Activity Log Alerts in your subscription.

4. **Check for Create or Update Security Policy Alert**: Finally, you can check if there is an alert for Create or Update Security Policy. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   security_policy_alert_exists = False

   for alert in alerts:
       if 'Create or Update Security Policy' in alert.name:
           security_policy_alert_exists = True
           break

   if security_policy_alert_exists:
       print('Activity Log Alert for Create or Update Security Policy exists.')
   else:
       print('Activity Log Alert for Create or Update Security Policy does not exist.')
   ```
   This will print whether an Activity Log Alert for Create or Update Security Policy exists or not.

from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

TENANT_ID = '<your tenant id>'
CLIENT_ID = '<your client id>'
CLIENT_SECRET = '<your client secret>'

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=CLIENT_ID,
    secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
    tenant=TENANT_ID
)
```

3. Use the Azure SDK for Python to check if an Activity Log Alert exists for Create or Update Security Policy. You can use the following code to check if the alert exists:
```python
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import AlertRuleResource

SUBSCRIPTION_ID = '<your subscription id>'
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME = '<your resource group name>'
ALERT_RULE_NAME = '<your alert rule name>'

monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credentials, SUBSCRIPTION_ID)

alert_rule = monitor_client.alert_rules.get(
    resource_group_name=RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME,
    rule_name=ALERT_RULE_NAME
)

if isinstance(alert_rule, AlertRuleResource) and alert_rule.condition.all_of[0].field == 'resourceType' and alert_rule.condition.all_of[0].equals == 'Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups' and alert_rule.condition.all_of[1].field == 'operationName' and alert_rule.condition.all_of[1].equals == 'Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/write':
    print('Activity Log Alert exists for Create or Update Security Policy')

            equals='Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups'
        ),
        AlertRuleAnyOfOrLeafCondition(
            field='operationName',
            equals='Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/write'
        )
    ]
)

action_group = AlertRuleActionGroup(
    action_group_id=ACTION_GROUP_ID
)

action_list = AlertRuleActionList(
    email_actions=[
        AlertRuleEmailAction(
            send_to_service_owners=True
        )
    ],
    action_groups=[
        action_group
    ]

alert_rule = AlertRuleResource(
    location='global',
    alert_rule_name=ALERT_RULE_NAME,
    description='Activity Log Alert for Create or Update Security Policy',
    condition=condition,
    actions=action_list,
    is_enabled=True
)

monitor_client.alert_rules.create_or_update(
    resource_group_name=RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME,
    rule_name=ALERT_RULE_NAME,
    parameters=alert_rule
)

print('Activity Log Alert created for Create or Update Security Policy')
