### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to the "Storage accounts" section. 

2. Select the storage account you want to inspect. In the storage account window, click on the "Blob service" section, then select "Containers".

3. Choose the container that is supposed to contain the logs. 

4. In the container settings, navigate to the "Encryption" section. Here, you can check if the "Customer-managed key" option is enabled. If it is, the container is encrypted with BYOK (Bring Your Own Key). If not, the container is not encrypted with BYOK.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install the Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft website and follow the installation instructions. Once installed, open your command line interface and log in to your Azure account using the command: 
   ```
   az login
   ```
   Follow the prompts in your web browser to complete the authentication process.

2. After logging in, you can list all the storage accounts in your Azure subscription using the following command:
   ```
   az storage account list
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details about all your storage accounts.

3. To check if a specific storage account container is encrypted with BYOK, you need to get the properties of the storage account. Replace `<storage-account-name>` with the name of your storage account:
   ```
   az storage account show --name <storage-account-name> --query encryption.keyVaultProperties
   ```
   This command will return the KeyVault properties of the storage account encryption. If the storage account is encrypted with BYOK, the `keyVaultProperties` will contain the details of the KeyVault and the key used for encryption.

4. To check if the logs container in the storage account is encrypted, you need to get the properties of the blob service in the storage account. Replace `<storage-account-name>` with the name of your storage account:
   ```
   az storage blob service-properties show --account-name <storage-account-name> --query staticWebsite
   ```
   This command will return the properties of the blob service. If the logs container is encrypted, the `staticWebsite` property will be set to true.

#### Using Python

To check if a Storage Account container containing the logs is encrypted with BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) in Azure Monitoring using Python scripts, follow these steps:

1. Install and Import Required Libraries:
   First, you need to install the Azure SDK for Python using pip. This SDK provides libraries to interact with Azure services including Azure Storage. You can install it using the following command:
   ```
   pip install azure-storage-blob
   ```
   Then, import the required libraries in your Python script:
   ```python
   from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
   from azure.keyvault.keys import KeyClient
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   ```

2. Connect to Azure Storage Account:
   Use the BlobServiceClient class to create a client for the storage account. You will need the connection string for your storage account which you can get from the Azure portal.
   ```python
   blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(my_connection_string)
   ```

3. Retrieve the Encryption Scope:
   Retrieve the encryption scope of the blob container where the logs are stored. If the encryption scope is set to a customer-managed key, then the container is encrypted with BYOK.
   ```python
   blob_container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(my_container_name)
   properties = blob_container_client.get_container_properties()
   encryption_scope = properties.encryption_scope
   ```

4. Check the Encryption Key:
   Use the KeyClient class to connect to Azure Key Vault and retrieve the key used for encryption. If the key is a customer-managed key, then the container is encrypted with BYOK.
   ```python
   key_client = KeyClient(vault_url=my_key_vault_url, credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
   key = key_client.get_key(encryption_scope)
   if key.properties.managed:
       print("The container is not encrypted with BYOK.")
   else:
       print("The container is encrypted with BYOK.")
   ```

Please replace `my_connection_string`, `my_container_name`, and `my_key_vault_url` with your actual Azure Storage account connection string, container name, and Key Vault URL respectively.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Storage Account container containing the logs is encrypted with BYOK" for Azure using the Azure console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the Storage account that is being used to store the logs.
3. Click on the "Containers" option under the "Blob service" section in the left-hand menu.
4. Select the container that contains the logs.
5. Click on the "Encryption" option in the left-hand menu.
6. Select the "Customer-managed key" option.
7. Select the key that you want to use for encryption from the dropdown list.
8. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you will ensure that the Storage Account container containing the logs is encrypted with BYOK in Azure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration in AZURE using AZURE CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AZURE CLI and login to your AZURE account using the command:

   `az login`

2. Once you have successfully logged in, set the subscription that contains the storage account container using the command:

   `az account set --subscription <subscription_id>`

3. Next, get the resource ID of the storage account container using the command:

   `az storage account show -n <storage_account_name> -g <resource_group_name> --query id --output tsv`

4. Now, create a new customer-managed key (CMK) using the command:

   `az keyvault create -n <key_vault_name> -g <resource_group_name> --location <location> --sku standard`

5. Once the key vault is created, get the key identifier using the command:

   `az keyvault key show --vault-name <key_vault_name> -n <key_name> --query key.kid --output tsv`

6. Now, enable encryption for the storage account container using the command:

   `az storage account update -n <storage_account_name> -g <resource_group_name> --encryption-services blob --encryption-key-name <key_name> --encryption-key-vault <key_vault_uri>`

   Replace `<key_name>` with the name of the key you created in step 4, and `<key_vault_uri>` with the URI of the key vault you created in step 4.

7. Finally, verify that the storage account container is encrypted with BYOK using the command:

   `az storage container show -n <container_name> --account-name <storage_account_name> --account-key <storage_account_key> --query properties.encryption`

   Replace `<container_name>` with the name of the container, `<storage_account_name>` with the name of the storage account, and `<storage_account_key>` with the access key for the storage account.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration by encrypting the storage account container with BYOK in AZURE using AZURE CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration in Azure, you can use the Azure Python SDK to encrypt the Storage Account container containing the logs with BYOK. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. First, you need to create a new key vault in Azure to store the encryption key. You can use the following code to create a new key vault:

```python
from azure.mgmt.keyvault import KeyVaultManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

resource_group_name = 'my-resource-group'
key_vault_name = 'my-key-vault'
location = 'eastus'

resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
keyvault_client = KeyVaultManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

key_vault_params = {
    'location': location,
    'properties': {
        'sku': {
            'name': 'standard'
        },
        'tenantId': tenant_id,
        'accessPolicies': [],
        'enabledForDeployment': True,
        'enabledForDiskEncryption': True,
        'enabledForTemplateDeployment': True
    }
}

key_vault = keyvault_client.vaults.create_or_update(resource_group_name, key_vault_name, key_vault_params)
```

2. Once you have created the key vault, you can create a new encryption key in the key vault using the following code:

```python
from azure.keyvault.keys import KeyClient
from azure.keyvault.keys.crypto import CryptographyClient

key_client = KeyClient(vault_url=key_vault.properties.vault_uri, credential=credential)
key_name = 'my-encryption-key'

# Create a new key
key = key_client.create_rsa_key(key_name, hsm=False, size=2048)

# Get the key's ID and version
key_id = key.id
key_version = key.properties.version

# Create a cryptography client for the key
crypto_client = CryptographyClient(key_id, credential)
```

3. Next, you need to enable encryption for the Storage Account container containing the logs. You can use the following code to enable encryption:

```python
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
from azure.storage.blob.models import BlobEncryptionPolicy, ClientSideEncryptionAlgorithm

storage_account_name = 'my-storage-account'
container_name = 'my-container'

blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(storage_connection_string)
container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(container_name)

# Create a new encryption policy with the encryption key
encryption_policy = BlobEncryptionPolicy(
    client_side_encryption_algorithm=ClientSideEncryptionAlgorithm.AES_CBC_256,
    key_wrap_algorithm='RSA-OAEP',
    key_encryption_key=crypto_client
)

# Enable encryption for the container
container_properties = container_client.get_container_properties()
container_properties.default_encryption_scope = 'my-encryption-scope'
container_client.set_container_properties(container_properties)
```

4. Finally, you need to verify that the encryption is enabled for the Storage Account container. You can use the following code to verify:

```python
from azure.storage.blob import BlobProperties

blob_client = container_client.get_blob_client('my-blob')

# Get the blob properties to verify encryption
blob_properties = blob_client.get_blob_properties()
assert isinstance(blob_properties.encryption_scope, BlobEncryptionPolicy)
```

With these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration in Azure by encrypting the Storage Account container containing the logs with BYOK.
