<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of activity log retention for Azure using Python, you need to use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps to remediate the issue:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python by running the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install azure-mgmt-monitor
```

2. Import the necessary modules in your Python script:

```
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
```

3. Set the credentials for your Azure account by creating a Service Principal and assigning it the appropriate permissions. You will need to provide the following details in your script:

- Tenant ID
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Subscription ID

```
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id='<client-id>',
    secret='<client-secret>',
    tenant='<tenant-id>'
)

subscription_id = '<subscription-id>'
```

4. Create a MonitorManagementClient object using the credentials and subscription ID:

```
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(
    credentials=credentials,
    subscription_id=subscription_id
)
```

5. Retrieve the current retention period for activity logs:

```
retention_period = monitor_client.activity_log_alerts.list()[0].retention_policy.enabled
```

6. If the retention period is less than 365 days, update the retention policy:

```
if retention_period < 365:
    monitor_client.activity_log_alerts.update_retention_policy(
        enabled=True,
        days=365
    )
```

7. Run the script to remediate the misconfiguration.

This will ensure that activity log retention is set for 365 days or greater in Azure.
