### More Info:

Configuring the storage account with the activity log export container to use BYOK (Use Your Own Key) provides additional confidentiality controls on log data as a given user must have read permission on the corresponding storage account and must be granted decrypt permission by the CMK.

### Risk Level

Low

### Address

Security, Operational Maturity

### Compliance Standards

ISO27001, NIST, SOC2, HIPAA, CISAZURE, CBP

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Storage Account container containing the logs is encrypted with BYOK" for Azure using the Azure console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the Storage account that is being used to store the logs.
3. Click on the "Containers" option under the "Blob service" section in the left-hand menu.
4. Select the container that contains the logs.
5. Click on the "Encryption" option in the left-hand menu.
6. Select the "Customer-managed key" option.
7. Select the key that you want to use for encryption from the dropdown list.
8. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you will ensure that the Storage Account container containing the logs is encrypted with BYOK in Azure.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this misconfiguration in AZURE using AZURE CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AZURE CLI and login to your AZURE account using the command:

   `az login`

2. Once you have successfully logged in, set the subscription that contains the storage account container using the command:

   `az account set --subscription <subscription_id>`

3. Next, get the resource ID of the storage account container using the command:

   `az storage account show -n <storage_account_name> -g <resource_group_name> --query id --output tsv`

4. Now, create a new customer-managed key (CMK) using the command:

   `az keyvault create -n <key_vault_name> -g <resource_group_name> --location <location> --sku standard`

5. Once the key vault is created, get the key identifier using the command:

   `az keyvault key show --vault-name <key_vault_name> -n <key_name> --query key.kid --output tsv`

6. Now, enable encryption for the storage account container using the command:

   `az storage account update -n <storage_account_name> -g <resource_group_name> --encryption-services blob --encryption-key-name <key_name> --encryption-key-vault <key_vault_uri>`

   Replace `<key_name>` with the name of the key you created in step 4, and `<key_vault_uri>` with the URI of the key vault you created in step 4.

7. Finally, verify that the storage account container is encrypted with BYOK using the command:

   `az storage container show -n <container_name> --account-name <storage_account_name> --account-key <storage_account_key> --query properties.encryption`

   Replace `<container_name>` with the name of the container, `<storage_account_name>` with the name of the storage account, and `<storage_account_key>` with the access key for the storage account.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration by encrypting the storage account container with BYOK in AZURE using AZURE CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration in Azure, you can use the Azure Python SDK to encrypt the Storage Account container containing the logs with BYOK. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. First, you need to create a new key vault in Azure to store the encryption key. You can use the following code to create a new key vault:

```python
from azure.mgmt.keyvault import KeyVaultManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

resource_group_name = 'my-resource-group'
key_vault_name = 'my-key-vault'
location = 'eastus'

resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
keyvault_client = KeyVaultManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

key_vault_params = {
    'location': location,
    'properties': {
        'sku': {
            'name': 'standard'
        },
        'tenantId': tenant_id,
        'accessPolicies': [],
        'enabledForDeployment': True,
        'enabledForDiskEncryption': True,
        'enabledForTemplateDeployment': True
    }
}

key_vault = keyvault_client.vaults.create_or_update(resource_group_name, key_vault_name, key_vault_params)
```

2. Once you have created the key vault, you can create a new encryption key in the key vault using the following code:

```python
from azure.keyvault.keys import KeyClient
from azure.keyvault.keys.crypto import CryptographyClient

key_client = KeyClient(vault_url=key_vault.properties.vault_uri, credential=credential)
key_name = 'my-encryption-key'

# Create a new key
key = key_client.create_rsa_key(key_name, hsm=False, size=2048)

# Get the key's ID and version
key_id = key.id
key_version = key.properties.version

# Create a cryptography client for the key
crypto_client = CryptographyClient(key_id, credential)
```

3. Next, you need to enable encryption for the Storage Account container containing the logs. You can use the following code to enable encryption:

```python
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
from azure.storage.blob.models import BlobEncryptionPolicy, ClientSideEncryptionAlgorithm

storage_account_name = 'my-storage-account'
container_name = 'my-container'

blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(storage_connection_string)
container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(container_name)

# Create a new encryption policy with the encryption key
encryption_policy = BlobEncryptionPolicy(
    client_side_encryption_algorithm=ClientSideEncryptionAlgorithm.AES_CBC_256,
    key_wrap_algorithm='RSA-OAEP',
    key_encryption_key=crypto_client
)

# Enable encryption for the container
container_properties = container_client.get_container_properties()
container_properties.default_encryption_scope = 'my-encryption-scope'
container_client.set_container_properties(container_properties)
```

4. Finally, you need to verify that the encryption is enabled for the Storage Account container. You can use the following code to verify:

```python
from azure.storage.blob import BlobProperties

blob_client = container_client.get_blob_client('my-blob')

# Get the blob properties to verify encryption
blob_properties = blob_client.get_blob_properties()
assert isinstance(blob_properties.encryption_scope, BlobEncryptionPolicy)
```

With these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration in Azure by encrypting the Storage Account container containing the logs with BYOK.
