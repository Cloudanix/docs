### More Info:

Ensure that your Microsoft Azure virtual machine scale sets are configured to receive instance termination notifications through the Azure Metadata service and have a predefined delay timeout configured for the "Terminate" operation (event). The termination notifications are delivered through Scheduled Events, an Azure Metadata feature which sends termination notifications, and can also be used to delay impactful operations such as reboots and redeployments. The delay associated with the "Terminate" event will depend on the delay limit specified in the VM scale set model configuration.

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to the Azure Security Center.
2. In the Azure Security Center, go to the "Security policy" section. Here, you can see the security policies for your subscriptions.
3. Click on the subscription for which you want to check the Just-In-Time VM Access. This will open the "Policy & Compliance" blade.
4. In the "Policy & Compliance" blade, scroll down to the "Compute & Apps" section. Here, you can see the "Just-In-Time VM Access" policy. If it's enabled, it will show "On". If it's not enabled, it will show "Off".

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI commands, you need to have it installed on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal.

2. Login to Azure: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be redirected to the Azure login page where you need to enter your credentials.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, you need to select the one where your virtual machines are located. Use the following command to list all your subscriptions and select the one you need.
   ```
   az account list --output table
   az account set --subscription "Your Subscription Name"
   ```
4. Check Just-In-Time Access: Use the following command to check if Just-In-Time access is enabled for your virtual machines. Replace "YourResourceGroup" and "YourVMName" with your actual resource group and VM name.
   ```
   az security jit-policy show --location "YourResourceGroup" --name "YourVMName"
   ```
   If Just-In-Time access is enabled, you will see the policy details in the output. If not, the output will be empty or will show an error message.

#### Using Python

Just-In-Time VM Access is a feature provided by Azure Security Center that helps you control access to your Azure VMs. To detect whether Just-In-Time VM Access is enabled or not, you can use Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Azure SDK for Python**: You need to install Azure SDK for Python in your system. You can do this by using pip, which is a package manager for Python. Use the following command to install Azure SDK:

   ```python
   pip install azure
   ```

2. **Authenticate to Azure**: Before you can interact with Azure resources, you need to authenticate. You can authenticate using Azure Identity library. Here is a sample code:

   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   ```

3. **Initialize Security Center client**: After authentication, you need to initialize a client for Azure Security Center. You can do this using the following code:

   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter
   client = SecurityCenter(credential, "<subscription_id>")
   ```

4. **Check Just-In-Time VM Access**: Now, you can check whether Just-In-Time VM Access is enabled or not. You can do this by checking the 'jitNetworkAccessPolicies' of each VM. Here is a sample code:

   ```python
   for policy in client.jit_network_access_policies.list():
       print(f"Policy: {policy.name}, Status: {policy.provisioning_state}")
   ```

In the above code, replace "<subscription_id>" with your Azure subscription ID. If the 'provisioning_state' of a policy is 'Succeeded', it means that Just-In-Time VM Access is enabled for the VM associated with that policy. If not, it means that Just-In-Time VM Access is not enabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not having Just-In-Time (JIT) access enabled for virtual machines in Azure, you can follow the below steps using Azure Portal:

1. Log in to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the virtual machine for which you want to enable JIT access.
3. From the left-hand side menu, select "Security + networking".
4. Under the "Security" section, select "Just-in-time VM access".
5. On the Just-in-time VM access page, click on "Enable JIT on VM".
6. In the "Basic settings" section, select the "On" radio button to enable JIT access.
7. In the "Advanced settings" section, configure the following settings:
   - Maximum JIT access time: Set the maximum time for which the JIT access request will be valid.
   - Ports: Select the ports that you want to open for JIT access.
   - IP address: Select the IP address range from which you want to allow JIT access.
8. Click on the "Review + create" button to review the JIT access settings.
9. Once you have reviewed the settings, click on the "Create" button to enable JIT access for the virtual machine.

Once JIT access is enabled, users can request access to the virtual machine by clicking on the "Request access" button on the Just-in-time VM access page. The request will be reviewed and approved by an authorized user before access is granted.

#### Using CLI

To enable Just-In-Time (JIT) Access for Virtual Machines in Azure using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI in your preferred terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to enable JIT access for the virtual machine:

```
az vm update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <vm-name> --set "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions=JitAccess"
```

Note: Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of your resource group and `<vm-name>` with the name of your virtual machine.

3. After running the command, you will receive a JSON output containing the updated information about your virtual machine.
4. Verify that JIT access has been enabled for the virtual machine by going to the Azure portal and checking the virtual machine's "Security" settings. You should see "JIT VM access" enabled for the virtual machine.

That's it! JIT access has now been enabled for your virtual machine in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Enable Just-In-Time Access for Virtual Machines" in AZURE using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```python
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential
```

2. Authenticate and create the client object:

```python
credential = AzureCliCredential()
subscription_id = '<subscription_id>'
resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

3. Get the resource group and virtual machine name:

```python
resource_group_name = '<resource_group_name>'
vm_name = '<vm_name>'
```

4. Get the virtual machine object:

```python
vm = compute_client.virtual_machines.get(resource_group_name, vm_name)
```

5. Create the JIT access policy object:

```python
from azure.mgmt.network.models import (SecurityRuleAccess, SecurityRuleDirection, SecurityRuleProtocol, SecurityRule)
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

start_time = datetime.utcnow()
end_time = start_time + timedelta(minutes=30)

jit_access_policy = SecurityRule(
    access=SecurityRuleAccess.allow,
    description='JIT Access Policy',
    destination_address_prefix='*',
    destination_port_range='22',
    direction=SecurityRuleDirection.inbound,
    name='JIT Access Policy',
    priority=500,
    protocol=SecurityRuleProtocol.tcp,
    source_address_prefix='*',
    source_port_range='*',
    provisioning_state='Succeeded',
    start_time=start_time,
    end_time=end_time
)
```

6. Add the JIT access policy to the virtual machine network security group:

```python
nsg_name = vm.network_profile.network_interfaces[0].network_security_group.id.split('/')[-1]

nsg = network_client.network_security_groups.get(resource_group_name, nsg_name)
nsg.security_rules.append(jit_access_policy)

network_client.security_rules.create_or_update(resource_group_name, nsg_name, jit_access_policy.name, jit_access_policy)
```

7. Save the changes:

```python
nsg = network_client.network_security_groups.create_or_update(resource_group_name, nsg_name, nsg)
```

This will enable JIT access for the virtual machine in Azure.
