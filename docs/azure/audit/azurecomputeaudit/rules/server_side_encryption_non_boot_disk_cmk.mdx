### More Info:

Microsoft Azure provides multiple distinct layers of encryption protection for virtual machine (VM) managed disks. VM managed disks are encrypted with Azure Storage encryption, also known as Server-Side Encryption (SSE), using platform-managed keys (PMK), to protect your data at rest and help you meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. By default, VM managed disk volumes (OS and data disk volumes) use platform-managed encryption keys.
