### More Info:

Microsoft Azure provides multiple distinct layers of encryption protection for virtual machine (VM) managed disks. VM managed disks are encrypted with Azure Storage encryption, also known as Server-Side Encryption (SSE), using platform-managed keys (PMK), to protect your data at rest and help you meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. By default, VM managed disk volumes (OS and data disk volumes) use platform-managed encryption keys.

### Risk Level

High

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

ISO27001, HIPAA

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to the "Virtual machines" section. Here, you will see a list of all your virtual machines.

2. Select the virtual machine for which you want to check the server-side encryption. In the virtual machine's page, go to the "Disks" section. Here, you will see all the disks attached to the virtual machine including the non-boot disks.

3. Click on the non-boot disk for which you want to check the server-side encryption. This will open the disk's page. In the disk's page, go to the "Settings" section and then click on "Encryption".

4. In the "Encryption" section, check the "Disk encryption set" field. If it is set to a Customer Managed Key (CMK), then the server-side encryption for the non-boot disk is using CMK. If it is not set or set to a platform managed key, then the server-side encryption for the non-boot disk is not using CMK.

#### Using CLI

1. Install the Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command line interface and log in to your Azure account using the following command:
   ```
   az login
   ```
   Follow the instructions to complete the login process.

2. List all the disks in your Azure account. This will display all the disks along with their properties. Use the following command:
   ```
   az disk list --query "[].{name:name, resourceGroup:resourceGroup, encryptionType:encryptionSettingsCollection.encryptionSettings[0].encryptionType}"
   ```
   This command will list all the disks along with their encryption type.

3. Filter out the non-boot disks from the list. Non-boot disks are those which are not attached to any virtual machine or those which are not the OS disk of the virtual machine. You can use the following command to list all the non-boot disks:
   ```
   az disk list --query "[?managedBy==null || osType==null].{name:name, resourceGroup:resourceGroup, encryptionType:encryptionSettingsCollection.encryptionSettings[0].encryptionType}"
   ```
   This command will list all the non-boot disks along with their encryption type.

4. Check the encryption type of each non-boot disk. If the encryption type is not 'EncryptionAtRestWithCustomerKey' then the disk is not encrypted with a customer-managed key (CMK). You can manually check this from the output of the previous command.

#### Using Python

1. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the Google Cloud client:

```python
from google.cloud import storage
client = storage.Client()
```

2. Define a function to check the encryption status of non-boot disks:

```python
def check_encryption(bucket_name):
    bucket = client.get_bucket(bucket_name)
    blobs = client.list_blobs(bucket_name)

    for blob in blobs:
        if not blob.name.startswith('boot'):
            encryption = blob.customer_encryption
            if encryption is None:
                print(f'Non-boot disk {blob.name} in bucket {bucket_name} is not encrypted with a customer-managed key.')
            else:
                print(f'Non-boot disk {blob.name} in bucket {bucket_name} is encrypted with a customer-managed key.')
```

3. Call the function with the name of the bucket you want to check:

```python
check_encryption('my-bucket')
```

4. This script will print out the encryption status of all non-boot disks in the specified bucket. If a disk is not encrypted with a customer-managed key, this could be a potential misconfiguration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration:

1. Log in to the Azure portal using your credentials.

2. Navigate to the virtual machine that has the misconfiguration.

3. Click on the "Disks" option from the left-hand side menu.

4. Select the non-boot disk that requires encryption.

5. Click on the "Disk encryption" option from the top menu.

6. Select "Customer-managed key" for the encryption type.

7. Select the key that you want to use for encryption from the list of available keys.

8. Click on "Save" to apply the changes.

9. Wait for the encryption process to complete. This may take a few minutes.

10. Once the encryption process is complete, verify that the disk is now encrypted by checking the "Encryption status" column on the "Disks" page.

Congratulations! You have now successfully remediated the misconfiguration by enabling server-side encryption for the non-boot disk using a customer-managed key in Azure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Server Side Encryption for Non-Boot Disk using CMK" for AZURE using AZURE CLI, please follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the Azure CLI on your local machine.

Step 2: Run the following command to list all the disks in your subscription:
```
az disk list
```

Step 3: Identify the disk that is not using Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Managed Keys (CMK).

Step 4: Run the following command to enable Server-Side Encryption with CMK for the identified disk:
```
az disk update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <disk-name> --encryption-type EncryptionAtRestWithCustomerKey --disk-encryption-key $(az keyvault secret show --vault-name <key-vault-name> --name <key-name> --query id -o tsv)
```
Note: Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group that contains the disk, `<disk-name>` with the name of the disk, `<key-vault-name>` with the name of the Key Vault, and `<key-name>` with the name of the key.

Step 5: Verify that the disk is now using Server-Side Encryption with CMK by running the following command:
```
az disk show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <disk-name> --query encryptionSettings.diskEncryptionKey.encryptionType
```
The output should be `EncryptionAtRestWithCustomerKey`.

Step 6: Repeat the above steps for all the disks in your subscription that are not using Server-Side Encryption with CMK.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Server Side Encryption for Non-Boot Disk using CMK" for AZURE using AZURE CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Server Side Encryption for Non-Boot Disk using CMK in AZURE using python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the required libraries:
```
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.storage import StorageManagementClient
```

2. Authenticate with Azure using DefaultAzureCredential:
```
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
storage_client = StorageManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

3. Get the list of all the virtual machines in the subscription:
```
vm_list = compute_client.virtual_machines.list_all()
```

4. Loop through all the virtual machines and get the disks attached to them:
```
for vm in vm_list:
    disk_ids = []
    for disk in vm.storage_profile.data_disks:
        disk_ids.append(disk.managed_disk.id)
```

5. Check if the disks have server-side encryption enabled:
```
for disk_id in disk_ids:
    encryption = storage_client.disks.get_encryption_status(disk_id)
    if encryption.disk_encryption_key:
        print("Disk with ID {} is encrypted with CMK.".format(disk_id))
    else:
        print("Disk with ID {} is not encrypted with CMK.".format(disk_id))
```

6. If the disk is not encrypted with CMK, enable encryption using the following code:
```
encryption_set_id = '/subscriptions/{}/resourceGroups/{}/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/{}/encryptionKeys/{}/encryptionKeyVersions/{}'.format(subscription_id, resource_group_name, key_vault_name, key_name, key_version)
encryption_settings = storage_client.encryption_services.get(resource_group_name, account_name, 'blob')
encryption_settings.encryption_services[0].key_vault_properties.key_uri = encryption_set_id
storage_client.encryption_services.create_or_update(resource_group_name, account_name, 'blob', encryption_settings)
```

Note: Replace the placeholders `your_subscription_id`, `resource_group_name`, `key_vault_name`, `key_name`, `key_version`, and `account_name` with your own values.

These steps should help you remediate the misconfiguration of Server Side Encryption for Non-Boot Disk using CMK in AZURE using python.
