### More Info:

Ensure that email or webhook-based alert notifications are enabled for your Microsoft Azure virtual machine scale sets in order to get notified for successful or failed autoscale actions. Email notifications can be sent to any valid email address that you configure. Administrators and co-administrators of the Azure subscription where the virtual machine scale set is running will also be notified. Webhooks allow you to route the autoscale alert notifications to other systems for post-processing or custom notifications.
