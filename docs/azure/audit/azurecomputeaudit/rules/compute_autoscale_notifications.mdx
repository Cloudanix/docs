### More Info:

Ensure that email or webhook-based alert notifications are enabled for your Microsoft Azure virtual machine scale sets in order to get notified for successful or failed autoscale actions. Email notifications can be sent to any valid email address that you configure. Administrators and co-administrators of the Azure subscription where the virtual machine scale set is running will also be notified. Webhooks allow you to route the autoscale alert notifications to other systems for post-processing or custom notifications.

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to the "Virtual Machine Scale Sets" section. 

2. Select the desired Virtual Machine Scale Set for which you want to check the Autoscale Notifications. 

3. In the left-hand menu, under "Settings", click on "Scaling". 

4. In the Scaling page, under "Scale out", check if the "Send email notification" option is enabled. If it is enabled, Autoscale Notifications are turned on.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI commands, you need to have Azure CLI installed on your system. You can download it from the official Azure website and install it.

2. Login to Azure: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be prompted to enter your username and password.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. Select the subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, select the subscription where the autoscale setting is configured. Replace 'my-subscription-name' with your subscription name.
   ```
   az account set --subscription 'my-subscription-name'
   ```
4. Check Autoscale Notifications: Use the following command to check the autoscale notifications. Replace 'myResourceGroup' with your resource group name, 'myScaleSet' with your scale set name.
   ```
   az monitor autoscale show --resource-group 'myResourceGroup' --name 'myScaleSet' --query 'notifications'
   ```
   This command will return the autoscale notifications settings. If the notifications are enabled, it will return the details of the notifications. If not, it will return null.

#### Using Python

To check if Autoscale Notifications are enabled in Compute, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Azure SDK for Python**: You need to install the Azure SDK for Python if it's not already installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install azure-mgmt-compute
   ```
2. **Set up Azure credentials**: You need to set up Azure credentials in your environment. You can do this by setting the `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables. You can get these values from your Azure portal.

3. **Create a Compute Management Client**: You need to create a Compute Management Client using your subscription ID:
   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
   from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

   credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
       client_id=os.environ['AZURE_CLIENT_ID'],
       secret=os.environ['AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET'],
       tenant=os.environ['AZURE_TENANT_ID']
   )

   compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credentials, '<your-subscription-id>')
   ```
4. **Check Autoscale Notifications**: You can now use the `compute_client` to check if Autoscale Notifications are enabled for a specific virtual machine scale set:
   ```python
   scale_set = compute_client.virtual_machine_scale_sets.get('<resource-group-name>', '<scale-set-name>')

   if scale_set.autoscale_notifcations is not None:
       print("Autoscale Notifications are enabled")
   else:
       print("Autoscale Notifications are not enabled")
   ```
   Replace `<resource-group-name>` and `<scale-set-name>` with the name of your resource group and the name of your virtual machine scale set.

Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions to read the configuration of the virtual machine scale set.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling Autoscale Notifications in Azure, you can follow the below steps using the Azure console:

1. Go to the Azure portal and navigate to the Autoscale settings of the resource group that you want to remediate.

2. In the Autoscale settings, select the resource that you want to enable notifications for.

3. Click on the "Notifications" tab, and then click "Add notification".

4. Select the notification type that you want to use. You can choose from Email, SMS, Webhook, or Azure Function.

5. Enter the details of the notification, such as the email address or phone number.

6. Click "Save" to save the notification.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 to add additional notifications if needed.

8. Once you have added all the notifications that you need, click "Save" to save the Autoscale settings.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration of enabling Autoscale Notifications in Azure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling Autoscale Notifications in AZURE using AZURE CLI, you can follow the below step by step instructions:

1. Open the AZURE CLI and login to your AZURE account using the below command:
   
   `az login`

2. Once you are logged in, set the subscription where you want to enable the Autoscale Notifications using the below command:
   
   `az account set --subscription <subscription_id>`

3. Now, enable the Autoscale Notifications for your AZURE account using the below command:
   
   `az monitor autoscale update --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <autoscale_setting_name> --email-administrator <email_address> --verbose`

   Here, replace the `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group where your Autoscale setting is located, `<autoscale_setting_name>` with the name of the Autoscale setting that you want to update and `<email_address>` with the email address where you want to receive the notifications.

4. After running the above command, you will receive a confirmation message that the Autoscale Notifications have been enabled for your account.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of enabling Autoscale Notifications in AZURE using AZURE CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling autoscale notifications in Azure using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
```

2. Set up the credentials for authentication:

```python
subscription_id = '<Subscription ID>'
client_id = '<Client ID>'
client_secret = '<Client Secret>'
tenant_id = '<Tenant ID>'

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=client_id,
    secret=client_secret,
    tenant=tenant_id
)
```

3. Instantiate the `MonitorManagementClient`:

```python
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
```

4. Get the autoscale settings:

```python
autoscale_settings = monitor_client.autoscale_settings.list()
```

5. For each autoscale setting, check if notifications are enabled. If not, enable them:

```python
for setting in autoscale_settings:
    if not setting.notification:
        setting.notification = {}
        setting.notification.email = {}
        setting.notification.email.send_to_subscription_administrator = True
        monitor_client.autoscale_settings.create_or_update(
            resource_group_name=setting.id.split('/')[4],
            autoscale_setting_name=setting.name,
            parameters=setting
        )
```

6. Verify that notifications have been enabled by checking the `notification` attribute of each autoscale setting.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of enabling autoscale notifications in Azure using Python.
