### More Info:

Ensure that your Microsoft Azure virtual machines (VMs) are configured to use managed disk volumes for reliable, efficient and simplified disk management. A managed disk is an abstraction of current Standard/Premium storage disk in Azure Storage. Managed disks provide granular access control with RBAC and better reliability for the virtual machines deployed within an Azure Availability Set.
