### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal by entering "https://portal.azure.com" in your web browser. Enter your Azure account credentials to log in.

2. Navigate to the Virtual Machines section: Once you are logged in, click on the "Virtual Machines" option in the left-hand side menu. This will open a list of all the virtual machines that are currently running in your Azure account.

3. Check for unattached disk volumes: Click on each virtual machine to open its details. In the virtual machine's details page, click on the "Disks" option in the left-hand side menu. This will open a list of all the disk volumes that are attached to the virtual machine. If there are any disk volumes that are not attached to any virtual machine, they will be listed here.

4. Verify the status of the disk: In the list of disks, look for any disks that have the status "Unattached". This indicates that the disk volume is not currently attached to any virtual machine.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Azure CLI: Before you can run any commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. After installation, you can configure it by running `az login` and following the prompts.

2. List all disks: Use the following command to list all the disks in your Azure subscription. This will return a list of all the disks, including those that are attached and unattached.

    ```
    az disk list --query "[?managedBy=='']" -o table
    ```

    This command uses the `--query` parameter to filter out disks that are not attached to any VM (i.e., `managedBy` property is empty). The `-o table` option is used to format the output as a table.

3. Review the output: The output of the above command will include details about each unattached disk, including its name, resource group, location, and size. Review this list to identify any unattached disks that may be a misconfiguration.

4. Automate the detection: If you want to automate the detection of unattached disks, you can write a Python script that uses the Azure SDK to run the above command and parse the output. The script can then alert you if it detects any unattached disks.

#### Using Python

1. AWS:

- Install and configure AWS CLI and Boto3 Python library.
- Use the following Python script to detect unattached EBS volumes:

```python
import boto3
ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
volumes = ec2.volumes.all() # Retrieve all volumes
for volume in volumes:
    if volume.state == 'available': # If volume is 'available', it is unattached
        print(volume.id)
```

2. Azure:

- Install and configure Azure CLI and Azure SDK for Python.
- Use the following Python script to detect unattached disk volumes:

```python
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

disks = compute_client.disks.list()
for disk in disks:
    if disk.disk_state == 'Unattached':
        print(disk.name)
```

3. GCP:

- Install and configure Google Cloud SDK and Google Cloud Client Library for Python.
- Use the following Python script to detect unattached disk volumes:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

project = 'your-project-id'
client = compute_v1.DisksClient()

disks = client.list(project=project, zone='your-zone')
for disk in disks:
    if 'users' not in disk:
        print(disk.name)
```
In the above scripts, replace 'your-subscription-id', 'your-project-id', and 'your-zone' with your actual Azure subscription ID, GCP project ID, and GCP zone respectively.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the "Remove Unattached Virtual Machine Disk Volume" misconfiguration for Azure using the Azure console:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Click on the "Virtual machines" option in the left-hand menu.
3. Select the virtual machine that has the unattached disk volume you want to remove.
4. Click on the "Disks" option in the left-hand menu.
5. Identify the unattached disk volume by looking for the "Unattached" status in the "Status" column.
6. Select the unattached disk volume by clicking on its name.
7. Click on the "Delete" button in the top menu bar.
8. In the confirmation window, click on the "Yes" button to confirm that you want to delete the unattached disk volume.

That's it! The unattached virtual machine disk volume has been successfully removed from your Azure account.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Remove Unattached Virtual Machine Disk Volume" misconfiguration for AZURE using AZURE CLI, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Open the AZURE CLI on your computer.

2. Run the following command to list all the virtual machines in your subscription:

   `az vm list --query "[].{name:name,resourceGroup:resourceGroup}" --output table`

   This will list all the virtual machines in your subscription along with their resource group.

3. Identify the virtual machine for which there are unattached disks.

4. Run the following command to list all the disks in your subscription:

   `az disk list --query "[].{name:name,resourceGroup:resourceGroup}" --output table`

   This will list all the disks in your subscription along with their resource group.

5. Identify the unattached disks that belong to the virtual machine identified in step 3.

6. Run the following command to delete the unattached disk:

   `az disk delete --name <disk-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>`

   Replace `<disk-name>` with the name of the unattached disk and `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group the disk belongs to.

7. Confirm the deletion by typing "y" when prompted.

8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 for all the unattached disks that belong to the identified virtual machine.

9. Verify that all the unattached disks have been deleted by running the command in step 4 again.

   This completes the remediation of the "Remove Unattached Virtual Machine Disk Volume" misconfiguration for AZURE using AZURE CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Remove Unattached Virtual Machine Disk Volume" misconfiguration in Azure using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
```

2. Authenticate with Azure using the `DefaultAzureCredential` class:

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = "your_subscription_id"
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

3. Get a list of all virtual machines in the subscription:

```python
vm_list = compute_client.virtual_machines.list_all()
```

4. For each virtual machine, get a list of all the disk volumes attached to it:

```python
for vm in vm_list:
    vm_id = vm.id
    vm_name = vm.name
    vm_rg_name = vm_id.split('/')[4]
    vm_disk_list = compute_client.disks.list_by_vm(vm_rg_name, vm_name)
```

5. For each disk volume, check if it is attached to any virtual machine. If it is not attached, delete the disk volume:

```python
for disk in vm_disk_list:
    disk_id = disk.id
    disk_name = disk.name
    disk_rg_name = disk_id.split('/')[4]
    disk_attach = compute_client.disks.list_vm_attachments(disk_rg_name, disk_name)
    if not disk_attach:
        compute_client.disks.delete(disk_rg_name, disk_name)
```

6. Run the Python script and verify that all unattached disk volumes have been removed.

Note: Make sure to test the script in a non-production environment before running it in a production environment.
