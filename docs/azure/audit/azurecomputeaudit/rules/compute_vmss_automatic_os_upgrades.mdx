### More Info:

Ensure that operating system (OS) upgrades are automatically applied to your Microsoft Azure virtual machine scale sets when a newer version of the OS image is released by the image publishers. Automatic OS Upgrades feature supports both Windows and Linux images, and can be enabled for all virtual machine sizes. An automatic OS upgrade works by replacing the boot (OS) disk of a virtual machine instance running within a scale set with a new disk created using the latest image version available. Any configured extensions and custom data scripts are run on the OS disk, while persisted data disks are retained.
