### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal by entering "https://portal.azure.com" in your web browser. Enter your login credentials to access your Azure account.

2. Navigate to Virtual Machines: Once you are logged in, look for the "Virtual Machines" service in the left-hand side menu. Click on it to access the list of all virtual machines in your Azure account.

3. Check the Image details: For each virtual machine, click on it to open its details. In the "Overview" section, you will find the "Image" field which shows the image used by the virtual machine. 

4. Verify the Image: Check if the image used is an approved one as per your organization's policy. If the image is not approved, it indicates a misconfiguration. Repeat this process for all the virtual machines in your Azure account.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install the Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal and type `az login` to log in to your Azure account.

2. List all Virtual Machines: Use the following command to list all the virtual machines in a specific subscription. Replace `<subscription-id>` with your actual subscription ID.

    ```
    az vm list --subscription <subscription-id> --query "[].{Name:name, ResourceGroup:resourceGroup, Image:storageProfile.imageReference}" -o table
    ```

    This command will output a table that includes the name of each VM, the resource group it belongs to, and the image used to create it.

3. Check the Image: The 'Image' column in the output table will show the image used to create each VM. You can compare this with the list of approved images for your organization. If any VM is using an unapproved image, it is a misconfiguration.

4. Automate the Process: To automate this process, you can write a Python script that uses the Azure SDK to list all VMs and their images, and then checks each image against a list of approved images. If any unapproved images are found, the script can send an alert or report.

#### Using Python

1. Install Azure SDK: To interact with Azure resources, you need to install Azure SDK in your python environment. You can do this by running the command `pip install azure`.

2. Import necessary modules: Import the necessary modules in your python script. You will need the `ComputeManagementClient` from `azure.mgmt.compute` to interact with Azure Compute resources.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
```

3. Authenticate and initialize: Authenticate to Azure using the `DefaultAzureCredential` which provides a simplified authentication experience to quickly start developing applications. Then, initialize the `ComputeManagementClient` with your subscription ID.

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

4. Check for approved machine images: Now, you can use the `compute_client` to list all the virtual machines in your subscription and check if they are using approved machine images. 

```python
for vm in compute_client.virtual_machines.list_all():
    image_reference = vm.storage_profile.image_reference
    if image_reference.publisher != 'approved-publisher' or image_reference.offer != 'approved-offer' or image_reference.sku != 'approved-sku':
        print(f"VM {vm.name} is not using an approved image")
```

In the above script, replace `'approved-publisher'`, `'approved-offer'`, and `'approved-sku'` with the details of your approved machine image. The script will print the names of all VMs that are not using the approved image.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

The issue of "Approved Azure Machine Image In Use" occurs when an Azure virtual machine is using an image that is not approved by the organization's policies. To remediate this issue, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Go to the virtual machine that is using the unapproved image.

3. Stop the virtual machine.

4. Go to the "Disks" section of the virtual machine.

5. Select the OS disk of the virtual machine.

6. Click on the "Create snapshot" button to create a snapshot of the OS disk.

7. Go to the "Images" section of the Azure portal.

8. Click on the "Add" button to create a new image.

9. Fill in the necessary details for the new image, including the name, description, and the snapshot that was created in step 6.

10. Click on the "Create" button to create the new image.

11. Once the image is created, go back to the virtual machine that was using the unapproved image.

12. Go to the "Configuration" section of the virtual machine.

13. Change the "Image" setting to the new image that was created in step 10.

14. Start the virtual machine.

The virtual machine should now be using the approved image, and the issue of "Approved Azure Machine Image In Use" should be remediated.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Approved Azure Machine Image In Use" misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the virtual machine(s) that are using the unapproved image. You can use the following Azure CLI command to list all the virtual machines in your subscription:

   ```
   az vm list --query "[].{name:name, image:storageProfile.imageReference}"
   ```

   This command will list all the virtual machines in your subscription along with their image references.

2. Check if any of the virtual machines are using the unapproved image. If you find any, note down their names.

3. Create a new virtual machine using an approved image. You can use the following Azure CLI command to create a new virtual machine:

   ```
   az vm create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <new-vm-name> --image <approved-image-name> --admin-username <admin-username> --admin-password <admin-password> --authentication-type password --size <vm-size> --location <location>
   ```

   Replace the `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group where you want to create the new virtual machine. Replace `<new-vm-name>` with the name you want to give to the new virtual machine. Replace `<approved-image-name>` with the name of the approved image that you want to use. Replace `<admin-username>` and `<admin-password>` with the username and password that you want to use to access the new virtual machine. Replace `<vm-size>` with the size of the virtual machine that you want to create. Replace `<location>` with the location where you want to create the new virtual machine.

4. Once the new virtual machine is created, you can migrate the data and applications from the old virtual machine to the new one.

5. Once you have migrated all the data and applications, you can stop and delete the old virtual machine. You can use the following Azure CLI commands to stop and delete the old virtual machine:

   ```
   az vm stop --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <old-vm-name>
   ```

   ```
   az vm delete --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <old-vm-name> --yes
   ```

   Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group where the old virtual machine is located. Replace `<old-vm-name>` with the name of the old virtual machine that you want to delete.

6. Verify that the new virtual machine is working as expected.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Approved Azure Machine Image In Use" in Azure using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to identify the virtual machines that are using the unapproved images. You can use the Azure Python SDK to get a list of all virtual machines in your subscription.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Get a list of all virtual machines in the subscription
vms = compute_client.virtual_machines.list_all()
```

2. Next, you need to check the image used by each virtual machine. You can use the `osProfile` property of the virtual machine to get the image reference.

```python
for vm in vms:
    image_reference = vm.storage_profile.image_reference
    if image_reference.publisher == 'MicrosoftWindowsServer' and image_reference.offer == 'WindowsServer' and image_reference.sku == '2016-Datacenter':
        print(f"VM {vm.name} is using an unapproved image.")
```

In this example, we are checking if the virtual machine is using the Windows Server 2016 Datacenter image from Microsoft. You can replace this with the approved image reference for your organization.

3. Finally, you need to update the virtual machine to use the approved image. You can use the `begin_update` method of the virtual machine to update the image reference.

```python
for vm in vms:
    image_reference = vm.storage_profile.image_reference
    if image_reference.publisher == 'MicrosoftWindowsServer' and image_reference.offer == 'WindowsServer' and image_reference.sku == '2016-Datacenter':
        print(f"Updating VM {vm.name}...")
        vm.storage_profile.image_reference = {
            'publisher': 'Canonical',
            'offer': 'UbuntuServer',
            'sku': '18.04-LTS',
            'version': 'latest'
        }
        compute_client.virtual_machines.begin_update(resource_group_name, vm.name, vm)
```

In this example, we are updating the virtual machine to use the latest version of the Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS image from Canonical. You can replace this with the approved image reference for your organization.

Note: You need to have appropriate permissions to update the virtual machine.
