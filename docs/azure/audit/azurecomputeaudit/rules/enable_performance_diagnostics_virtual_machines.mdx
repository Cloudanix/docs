### More Info:

Ensure that Performance Diagnostics feature is enabled for your Microsoft Azure virtual machine instances in order to help mitigate VM performance issues. Performance Diagnostics installs a VM extension that runs a self-help diagnostics tool named PerfInsights, available for both Windows and Linux operating systems. PerfInsights can collect and analyze diagnostic information such as virtual machine hardware and storage configuration, various log files, OS information, PCI device information, guest OS log files, configuration files, information about running processes, virtual machine instance disk, memory, CPU usage, and networking information.

To enable Performance Diagnostics for Azure Virtual Machines, you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).

2. In the left-hand menu, click on "Virtual machines".

3. Select the virtual machine that you want to enable Performance Diagnostics for.

4. In the virtual machine menu, click on "Diagnostic settings" under the Monitoring section.

5. Click on the "Add diagnostic setting" button.

6. In the "Add diagnostic setting" blade, give a name to the setting.

7. Under "Metrics", select the "Performance counters" option.

8. Click on the "Add +" button to add a new performance counter.

9. In the "Add performance counter" blade, select the desired counter from the list.

10. Click on the "Add" button to add the performance counter.

11. Under "Logs", select the "Performance counters" option.

12. Click on the "Add +" button to add a new performance counter.

13. In the "Add performance counter" blade, select the desired counter from the list.

14. Click on the "Add" button to add the performance counter.

15. Click on the "Save" button to save the diagnostic setting.

Once you have completed the above steps, Performance Diagnostics will be enabled for the selected Azure virtual machine. You can view the collected metrics and logs in the Azure portal by navigating to the "Metrics" and "Logs" sections respectively.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To enable performance diagnostics for Azure Virtual Machines using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI command prompt.

2. Set the subscription that contains the virtual machine. Use the following command to set the subscription:

   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
   ```

3. Enable performance diagnostics for the virtual machine. Use the following command to enable performance diagnostics:

   ```
   az vm diagnostics set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --vm-name <vm-name> --settings "{
     \"performanceCounters\": {
       \"sinks\": [
         {
           \"name\": \"<sink-name>\",
           \"destination\": {
             \"storageUri\": \"<storage-account-uri>\",
             \"sasToken\": \"<sas-token>\"
           }
         }
       ],
       \"performanceCounters\": [
         {
           \"category\": \"<category>\",
           \"counterSpecifier\": \"<counter-specifier>\",
           \"samplingInterval\": \"<sampling-interval>\",
           \"unit\": \"<unit>\"
         }
       ]
     }
   }"
   ```

   Replace the following values in the command:

   - `<resource-group-name>`: The name of the resource group that contains the virtual machine.
   - `<vm-name>`: The name of the virtual machine.
   - `<sink-name>`: The name of the sink that will receive the performance data.
   - `<storage-account-uri>`: The URI of the storage account that will receive the performance data.
   - `<sas-token>`: The SAS token for the storage account.
   - `<category>`: The category of the performance counter.
   - `<counter-specifier>`: The name of the performance counter.
   - `<sampling-interval>`: The sampling interval for the performance counter.
   - `<unit>`: The unit of the performance counter.

4. Verify that performance diagnostics have been enabled for the virtual machine. Use the following command to verify the settings:

   ```
   az vm diagnostics get-default-config --is-windows-os --resource-group <resource-group-name> --vm-name <vm-name>
   ```

   Replace `<resource-group-name>` and `<vm-name>` with the actual resource group and virtual machine names.

   The command will return the default configuration for the virtual machine. Verify that the performance counters are included in the configuration.

That's it! Performance diagnostics have been enabled for the Azure Virtual Machine.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To enable Performance Diagnostics for Azure Virtual Machines using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python. You can install it using pip by running the following command:

```
pip install azure-mgmt-compute
```

2. Authenticate with Azure. You can authenticate using a service principal or user credentials. Here's an example of how to authenticate using a service principal:

```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

TENANT_ID = '<your tenant id>'
CLIENT_ID = '<your client id>'
CLIENT_SECRET = '<your client secret>'

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=CLIENT_ID,
    secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
    tenant=TENANT_ID
)
```

3. Create a `ComputeManagementClient` object using the authenticated credentials:

```python
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.compute.models import DiagnosticsProfile, BootDiagnostics

SUBSCRIPTION_ID = '<your subscription id>'
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME = '<your resource group name>'
VM_NAME = '<your virtual machine name>'

compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credentials, SUBSCRIPTION_ID)
```

4. Get the virtual machine object:

```python
vm = compute_client.virtual_machines.get(
    RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME,
    VM_NAME
)
```

5. Enable Performance Diagnostics for the virtual machine:

```python
diagnostics_profile = DiagnosticsProfile(
    boot_diagnostics=BootDiagnostics(
        enabled=True,
        storage_uri='<your storage account uri>'
    )
)

vm.diagnostics_profile = diagnostics_profile

compute_client.virtual_machines.create_or_update(
    RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME,
    VM_NAME,
    vm
)
```

Replace `<your tenant id>`, `<your client id>`, `<your client secret>`, `<your subscription id>`, `<your resource group name>`, `<your virtual machine name>`, and `<your storage account uri>` with the appropriate values.

These steps will enable Performance Diagnostics for the specified Azure Virtual Machine.
