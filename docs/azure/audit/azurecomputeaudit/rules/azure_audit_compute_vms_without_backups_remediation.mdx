### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to portal.azure.com and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Navigate to Virtual Machines: From the left-hand menu, click on "Virtual Machines". This will open a list of all the virtual machines that are currently running in your Azure environment.

3. Check Backup Status: For each virtual machine, there should be a column labeled "Backup". This column will show the status of the backup for that particular virtual machine. If the status is "Not Enabled", then the virtual machine does not have backups configured.

4. Use Azure Policy: To ensure that all virtual machines have backups, you can use Azure Policy to enforce this. Navigate to "Policy" from the left-hand menu, then click on "Assignments". Create a new assignment with the policy definition "Azure Backup should be enabled for Virtual Machines". This policy will automatically check for virtual machines without backups and report them.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal and type `az login` to log in to your Azure account.

2. List all Virtual Machines: Use the following command to list all the virtual machines in a specific subscription. Replace `<subscription_id>` with your actual subscription id.

    ```
    az vm list --subscription <subscription_id> --query "[].{Name:name}" -o table
    ```

3. Check Backup Policy: For each virtual machine, check if a backup policy is assigned. Replace `<vm_name>` and `<resource_group>` with your actual VM name and resource group respectively.

    ```
    az backup policy list-associated-items --name <vm_name> --resource-group <resource_group> --query "[].{VM:name}" -o table
    ```

4. Analyze the Output: If the output of the above command is empty, it means that the virtual machine does not have a backup policy assigned. If there are entries in the output, it means that the virtual machine has a backup policy assigned. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each virtual machine in your subscription.

#### Using Python

Detecting whether virtual machines have backups in Compute can be done using Python scripts. Here's how you can do it for AWS, Azure, and GCP:

1. AWS:
   - Use the Boto3 library in Python to interact with AWS services.
   - Use the `describe_instances()` function to get a list of all EC2 instances.
   - For each instance, use the `list_tags_for_resource()` function to check if the 'Backup' tag is present.
   - Python script example:
     ```python
     import boto3
     ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
     for instance in ec2.instances.all():
         tags = instance.tags
         backup_tag = next((tag for tag in tags if tag['Key'] == 'Backup'), None)
         if backup_tag is None:
             print(f"Instance {instance.id} does not have a backup.")
     ```

2. Azure:
   - Use the Azure SDK for Python to interact with Azure services.
   - Use the `list_all()` function to get a list of all virtual machines.
   - For each VM, use the `list_by_resource_group()` function to check if a backup policy is associated with the VM.
   - Python script example:
     ```python
     from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
     from azure.mgmt.recoveryservicesbackup import RecoveryServicesBackupClient
     compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
     backup_client = RecoveryServicesBackupClient(credentials, subscription_id)
     for vm in compute_client.virtual_machines.list_all():
         backup_policy = backup_client.backup_policies.list_by_resource_group(vm.resource_group_name)
         if not backup_policy:
             print(f"VM {vm.name} does not have a backup policy.")
     ```

3. GCP:
   - Use the google-cloud-sdk library in Python to interact with GCP services.
   - Use the `list_instances()` function to get a list of all Compute Engine instances.
   - For each instance, use the `get()` function to check if the 'snapshotSchedule' property is set.
   - Python script example:
     ```python
     from google.cloud import compute_v1
     client = compute_v1.InstancesClient()
     for instance in client.list(project=project, zone=zone):
         snapshot_schedule = client.get(project=project, zone=zone, instance=instance.name).snapshot_schedule
         if not snapshot_schedule:
             print(f"Instance {instance.name} does not have a snapshot schedule.")
     ```
Please note that you need to replace `credentials`, `subscription_id`, `project`, and `zone` with your actual values. Also, these scripts only check if a backup policy or snapshot schedule is set, not whether the backups are actually being created successfully.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of virtual machines not having backups in AZURE using the AZURE console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AZURE portal.
2. In the left-hand menu, click on "Virtual machines".
3. Select the virtual machine that needs to be backed up.
4. In the virtual machine overview page, click on "Backup" under "Operations".
5. In the "Backup" page, click on "Configure Backup".
6. In the "Backup policy" page, click on "Create a new policy".
7. In the "New policy" page, select the backup frequency, retention range, and other backup settings.
8. Click on "OK" to create the backup policy.
9. In the "Backup" page, click on "Enable Backup" to enable backup for the virtual machine.
10. Review the backup policy and click on "OK".

Once you have completed these steps, the virtual machine will be backed up according to the policy you have set up. You can also verify the backup status of the virtual machine by going to the "Backup" page and checking the backup status.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Virtual Machines Should Have Backups" for Azure using Azure CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI in your terminal or command prompt.

2. Login to your Azure account using the command below:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

3. Once you are logged in, select the Azure subscription in which the virtual machines are present using the command below:

   ```bash
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
   ```
   
   Replace `<subscription_id>` with the ID of your Azure subscription.

4. To enable backups for a virtual machine, use the following command:

   ```bash
   az backup enable-for-vm --resource-group <resource_group_name> --vault-name <vault_name> --name <vm_name>
   ```
   
   Replace `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group in which the virtual machine is present, `<vault_name>` with the name of the backup vault in which the backups will be stored, and `<vm_name>` with the name of the virtual machine for which you want to enable backups.

5. Once the backups are enabled, you can configure the backup policy for the virtual machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   az backup policy set --policy-name <policy_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --vault-name <vault_name> --backup-management-type AzureIaasVM --item-name <vm_name>
   ```
   
   Replace `<policy_name>` with the name of the backup policy that you want to apply, `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group in which the virtual machine is present, `<vault_name>` with the name of the backup vault in which the backups will be stored, and `<vm_name>` with the name of the virtual machine for which you want to configure the backup policy.

6. After the backup policy is set, you can trigger the backup of the virtual machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   az backup protection enable-for-vm --resource-group <resource_group_name> --vault-name <vault_name> --policy-name <policy_name> --vm-name <vm_name>
   ```
   
   Replace `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group in which the virtual machine is present, `<vault_name>` with the name of the backup vault in which the backups will be stored, `<policy_name>` with the name of the backup policy that you have configured, and `<vm_name>` with the name of the virtual machine for which you want to trigger the backup.

7. Once the backup is completed, you can verify the backup status of the virtual machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   az backup job list --resource-group <resource_group_name> --vault-name <vault_name> --output table
   ```
   
   Replace `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group in which the virtual machine is present, and `<vault_name>` with the name of the backup vault in which the backups are stored.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Virtual Machines Should Have Backups" for Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of virtual machines not having backups in Azure using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules: 

```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.recoveryservices import RecoveryServicesClient
from azure.mgmt.recoveryservicesbackup import RecoveryServicesBackupClient
from azure.mgmt.recoveryservicesbackup.models import BackupRequestResource, BackupRequest, BackupRequestProperties, BackupRequestHeaders, BackupRequestVaultIdentity
from azure.mgmt.recoveryservicesbackup.models import BackupRequestResourceGroupDetails, BackupRequestResourceDetails, BackupRequestResourceOptions, BackupRequestResourceItem
from azure.mgmt.recoveryservicesbackup.models import BackupRequestResourceConfigDetails, BackupRequestResourceConfigDetailsDisk, BackupRequestResourceConfigDetailsFileFolder
```

2. Authenticate to Azure using Service Principal credentials:

```python
# Set the Azure credentials
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
client_id = 'your-client-id'
client_secret = 'your-client-secret'
tenant_id = 'your-tenant-id'

# Authenticate to Azure
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=client_id,
    secret=client_secret,
    tenant=tenant_id
)
```

3. Create a Compute Management Client and a Recovery Services Backup Client:

```python
# Create a Compute Management Client
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)

# Create a Recovery Services Backup Client
backup_client = RecoveryServicesBackupClient(credentials, subscription_id)
```

4. Get the list of virtual machines in the Azure subscription:

```python
# Get the list of virtual machines
vm_list = compute_client.virtual_machines.list_all()
```

5. For each virtual machine, check if it has a backup policy assigned. If not, create a backup policy and associate it with the virtual machine:

```python
# For each virtual machine, check if it has a backup policy assigned
for vm in vm_list:
    # Get the backup policy for the virtual machine
    backup_policy = backup_client.backup_policies.get(
        vm.id,
        "DefaultPolicy"
    )

    # If the virtual machine does not have a backup policy assigned, create one and associate it with the virtual machine
    if backup_policy is None:
        # Create a backup policy
        backup_policy = backup_client.backup_policies.create_or_update(
            vm.id,
            "DefaultPolicy",
            {
                "policyType": "Simple",
                "schedulePolicy": {
                    "scheduleRunFrequency": "Daily",
                    "scheduleRunDays": [
                        "Monday",
                        "Tuesday",
                        "Wednesday",
                        "Thursday",
                        "Friday",
                        "Saturday",
                        "Sunday"
                    ],
                    "scheduleRunTimes": [
                        "00:00"
                    ]
                },
                "retentionPolicy": {
                    "retentionPolicyType": "LongTerm",
                    "retentionDuration": {
                        "count": 365,
                        "durationType": "Days"
                    }
                }
            }
        )

        # Associate the backup policy with the virtual machine
        backup_client.protection_intent_items.create_or_update(
            vm.id,
            "DefaultPolicy",
            {
                "properties": {
                    "policyId": backup_policy.id
                }
            }
        )
```

6. Once the backup policy is assigned to the virtual machine, it will start taking backups automatically based on the schedule specified in the policy.

Note: This is just an example of how to remediate the misconfiguration of virtual machines not having backups in Azure using Python. The code may need to be modified based on your specific requirements and environment.
