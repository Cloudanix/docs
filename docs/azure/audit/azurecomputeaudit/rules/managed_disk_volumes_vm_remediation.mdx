### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Use Managed Disk Volumes for Virtual Machines" in AZURE using the AZURE console, follow these steps:

1. Login to your AZURE account and go to the AZURE portal.

2. Click on the "Virtual Machines" option from the left-hand menu.

3. Select the virtual machine for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

4. Click on the "Disks" option from the left-hand menu.

5. Check if the virtual machine is using managed disks or not. If it is not using managed disks, then you need to migrate the virtual machine to use managed disks.

6. To migrate the virtual machine to use managed disks, click on the "Migrate to managed disks" option from the top menu.

7. In the "Migrate to managed disks" window, select the subscription, resource group, and virtual machine that you want to migrate.

8. Click on the "Review + create" button to review the migration settings.

9. Review the migration settings and click on the "Create" button to start the migration process.

10. Once the migration process is completed, go back to the "Disks" option and verify that the virtual machine is now using managed disks.

11. Repeat the above steps for all the virtual machines in your AZURE environment that are not using managed disks.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Use Managed Disk Volumes for Virtual Machines" in AZURE using the AZURE console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Use Managed Disk Volumes for Virtual Machines" in AZURE using AZURE CLI, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Login to your AZURE account using AZURE CLI by running the command below:
```
az login
```

Step 2: Once you have logged in successfully, run the command below to list all the virtual machines in your subscription:
```
az vm list --query "[].{Name:name, ResourceGroup:resourceGroup}"
```

Step 3: Choose the virtual machine that you want to remediate and run the command below to convert the virtual machine's unmanaged disk to a managed disk:
```
az vm convert -g <resource-group-name> -n <vm-name> --force
```
Note: Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group where the virtual machine is located, and `<vm-name>` with the name of the virtual machine that you want to remediate.

Step 4: Wait for the conversion to complete. Once the conversion is complete, the virtual machine's unmanaged disk will be replaced with a managed disk.

Step 5: Verify that the virtual machine's unmanaged disk has been replaced with a managed disk by running the command below:
```
az vm show -g <resource-group-name> -n <vm-name> --query "storageProfile.osDisk.managedDisk"
```
Note: Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group where the virtual machine is located, and `<vm-name>` with the name of the virtual machine that you want to remediate.

Step 6: Repeat the above steps for all the virtual machines in your subscription to ensure that they are using managed disk volumes.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Use Managed Disk Volumes for Virtual Machines" in AZURE using AZURE CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of not using Managed Disk Volumes for Virtual Machines in Azure using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps to remediate it:

1. Import the necessary packages:

```python
from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
```

2. Authenticate with Azure using Azure CLI credentials:

```python
credential = AzureCliCredential()
subscription_id = '<your-subscription-id>'
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

3. Get a list of all the virtual machines in your subscription:

```python
virtual_machines = compute_client.virtual_machines.list_all()
```

4. For each virtual machine, check if it is using Managed Disk Volumes. If not, update the virtual machine to use Managed Disk Volumes:

```python
for vm in virtual_machines:
    vm_name = vm.name
    vm_resource_group = vm.id.split('/')[4]
    vm_parameters = compute_client.virtual_machines.get(vm_resource_group, vm_name)
    storage_profile = vm_parameters.storage_profile
    if storage_profile.os_disk.managed_disk is None:
        # Update the virtual machine to use Managed Disk Volumes
        storage_profile.os_disk.create_option = 'Attach'
        storage_profile.os_disk.managed_disk = {'storage_account_type': 'Standard_LRS'}
        compute_client.virtual_machines.create_or_update(vm_resource_group, vm_name, vm_parameters)
```

This code will iterate through all the virtual machines in your subscription and check if they are using Managed Disk Volumes. If they are not, it will update the virtual machine to use Managed Disk Volumes.
