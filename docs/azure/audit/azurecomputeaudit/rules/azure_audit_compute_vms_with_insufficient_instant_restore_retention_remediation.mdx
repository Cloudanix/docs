### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Open your web browser, visit the Azure portal and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Navigate to Virtual Machines: From the left-hand side menu, click on "Virtual Machines" to view the list of all the virtual machines currently deployed within your Azure account.

3. Check VM Backup Policy: For each virtual machine, click on the VM name to open its dashboard. From the VM dashboard, navigate to the "Operations" section and click on "Backup". Here, you can see the backup policy details including the retention period.

4. Verify Retention Period: Check the "Retention of instant restore snapshots" field. If the retention period is less than the recommended period (for example, less than 2 days), then the virtual machine does not have a sufficient instant restore retention period. Repeat this process for each virtual machine in your Azure account.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install the Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command line interface and run the following command to login to your Azure account:

   ```
   az login
   ```
   Follow the prompts in your command line interface to complete the login process.

2. List all the VMs: Once you are logged in, you can list all the virtual machines in your subscription by running the following command:

   ```
   az vm list --query "[].{name:name}" -o table
   ```
   This command will return a table that lists the names of all the virtual machines in your subscription.

3. Check the Instant Restore Retention Period: For each VM, you can check the Instant Restore Retention Period by running the following command:

   ```
   az backup policy list --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --vault-name <VaultName> --query "[].{name:name, retentionDuration:properties.instantRpRetentionRangeInDays}" -o table
   ```
   Replace `<ResourceGroupName>` and `<VaultName>` with the name of your resource group and the name of your vault respectively. This command will return a table that lists the names of all the backup policies and their Instant Restore Retention Period.

4. Analyze the output: The output of the previous command will show you the Instant Restore Retention Period for each VM. If the retention period is less than the recommended value, then it is a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

To check if Virtual Machines have sufficient Instant Restore Retention Period in Compute using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Setup Azure SDK for Python:**
   First, you need to install the Azure SDK for Python. You can do this using pip:
   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-compute
   ```
   This SDK allows you to interact with Azure's compute management client, which is necessary to retrieve information about the VMs.

2. **Authenticate with Azure:**
   Before you can interact with Azure's resources, you need to authenticate. You can do this using Azure's DefaultAzureCredential class. Here's an example:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
   compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
   ```

3. **Retrieve VMs and Check Retention Period:**
   Now that you're authenticated, you can retrieve the VMs and check their Instant Restore Retention Period. Here's an example:
   ```python
   for vm in compute_client.virtual_machines.list_all():
       backup_policy = compute_client.backup_policies.get(vm.resource_group_name, vm.name)
       if backup_policy.instant_restore_retention_days < desired_retention_days:
           print(f"VM {vm.name} has insufficient Instant Restore Retention Period.")
   ```
   This script will print out the names of all VMs that have an Instant Restore Retention Period less than the desired number of days.

4. **Handle Exceptions:**
   It's important to handle exceptions in your script to ensure it doesn't crash unexpectedly. For example, you might want to catch the ResourceNotFoundError exception that's raised when a VM doesn't have a backup policy:
   ```python
   from azure.core.exceptions import ResourceNotFoundError

   try:
       backup_policy = compute_client.backup_policies.get(vm.resource_group_name, vm.name)
   except ResourceNotFoundError:
       print(f"VM {vm.name} does not have a backup policy.")
   ```
   This will print out a message if a VM doesn't have a backup policy, instead of crashing the script.

Remember to replace 'your-subscription-id' and 'desired_retention_days' with your actual Azure subscription ID and the number of days you consider to be a sufficient Instant Restore Retention Period, respectively.

5. Once the retention period has been updated, the remediation is complete.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Virtual Machines Should Have Sufficient Instant Restore Retention Period" for Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Virtual Machines Should Have Sufficient Instant Restore Retention Period" in Azure using Python, you can use the Azure Python SDK to update the retention period of the virtual machine backups. 

Here are the steps to remediate the misconfiguration:

1. Install the Azure Python SDK by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-compute
   ```

2. Authenticate with Azure by providing your subscription ID, tenant ID, client ID, and client secret. You can do this by creating a Service Principal and granting it the required permissions. 

   ```
   from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
   
   subscription_id = '<your-subscription-id>'
   credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
       client_id='<your-client-id>',
       secret='<your-client-secret>',
       tenant='<your-tenant-id>'
   )
   ```

3. Use the `ComputeManagementClient` class from the Azure Python SDK to get a list of all the virtual machines in your subscription.

   ```
   from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
   
   compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
   vm_list = compute_client.virtual_machines.list_all()
   ```

4. For each virtual machine in the list, use the `BackupManagementClient` class from the Azure Python SDK to get the current retention policy for the virtual machine backups.

   ```
   from azure.mgmt.recoveryservicesbackup import BackupManagementClient
   
   backup_client = BackupManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
   for vm in vm_list:
       backup_policy = backup_client.backup_policies.get(
           '<your-resource-group>',
           '<your-backup-policy-name>'
       )
       retention_period = backup_policy.instant_rp.retention_period_in_days
   ```

5. If the retention period is less than the recommended value, update the retention policy using the `BackupManagementClient` class.

   ```
   if retention_period < <recommended-retention-period>:
       backup_policy.instant_rp.retention_period_in_days = <recommended-retention-period>
       backup_client.backup_policies.create_or_update(
           '<your-resource-group>',
           '<your-backup-policy-name>',
           backup_policy
       )
   ```

6. Run the script periodically to ensure that the retention policies of all virtual machines are up-to-date.

Note: Replace the placeholders `<your-subscription-id>`, `<your-client-id>`, `<your-client-secret>`, `<your-tenant-id>`, `<your-resource-group>`, `<your-backup-policy-name>`, and `<recommended-retention-period>` with your own values.
