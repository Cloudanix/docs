### More Info:

Ensure that your Microsoft Azure virtual machines (VMs) are using Standard SSD disk volumes instead of Premium SSD volumes for cost-effective storage that fits a broad range of workloads from web servers to enterprise applications that need consistent performance at lower IOPS levels. Unless you are running mission-critical applications or performance sensitive workloads that need more than 6000 IOPS or 750 MiB/s of throughput per VM disk volume, it's recommends converting your Premium SSD volumes to Standard SSD in order to lower the cost of your Azure monthly bill.
