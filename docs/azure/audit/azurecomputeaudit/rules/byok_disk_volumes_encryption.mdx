### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal by entering "https://portal.azure.com" in your web browser's address bar. Enter your login credentials to access your Azure account.

2. Navigate to the Disk: On the left-hand side of the Azure portal, click on "All services". In the "All services" pane, search for "Disks". Click on "Disks" to open the Disks pane.

3. Check Disk Encryption: In the Disks pane, select the disk you want to check. In the disk's properties pane, look for the "Encryption type" field. If the disk is encrypted using a customer-managed key, it will say "Customer-managed key".

4. Verify Key Source: To ensure that the key is a Bring Your Own Key (BYOK), check the "Key Source" field. If it says "Microsoft.KeyVault", then the key is a BYOK. If it says "Platform-managed key", then the key is not a BYOK.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI to detect misconfigurations, you need to install it on your local machine. Once installed, you can configure it by running the command `az login` and following the prompts.

2. List all the disk volumes: Use the following command to list all the disk volumes in your Azure account.

   ```
   az disk list --query "[].{Name:name, ResourceGroup:resourceGroup, EncryptionType:encryptionSettingsCollection.encryptionSettings[0].encryptionType}"
   ```

   This command will return a list of all disk volumes along with their names, resource groups, and encryption types.

3. Check the encryption type: From the output of the previous command, check the encryption type of each disk volume. If the encryption type is not 'EncryptionAtRestWithCustomerKey', then the disk volume is not using BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) for encryption.

4. Filter disks not using BYOK: To directly get the list of disks not using BYOK for encryption, you can modify the previous command as follows:

   ```
   az disk list --query "[?encryptionSettingsCollection.encryptionSettings[0].encryptionType!='EncryptionAtRestWithCustomerKey'].{Name:name, ResourceGroup:resourceGroup}"
   ```

   This command will return a list of disk volumes that are not using BYOK for encryption along with their names and resource groups.

#### Using Python

To check if "Use BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) for Disk Volumes Encryption in Compute" is enabled in AWS, Azure, and GCP, you can use the respective SDKs (Boto3 for AWS, Azure SDK for Python, and Google Cloud SDK for GCP) to interact with the cloud services. Here are the steps:

1. AWS:
   - Install and configure Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python.
   - Use the `describe_volumes` method of the EC2 client to get a list of all EBS volumes.
   - For each volume, check the `KmsKeyId` attribute. If it's not set, the volume is not using a customer-managed key.
   - Python script:
     ```python
     import boto3
     ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
     volumes = ec2.describe_volumes()
     for volume in volumes['Volumes']:
         if 'KmsKeyId' not in volume:
             print(f"Volume {volume['VolumeId']} is not using a customer-managed key.")
     ```

2. Azure:
   - Install and configure Azure SDK for Python.
   - Use the `list` method of the `DiskOperations` class to get a list of all disks.
   - For each disk, check the `encryption_settings` attribute. If the `disk_encryption_set_id` is not set, the disk is not using a customer-managed key.
   - Python script:
     ```python
     from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
     compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
     disks = compute_client.disks.list()
     for disk in disks:
         if not disk.encryption_settings.disk_encryption_set_id:
             print(f"Disk {disk.name} is not using a customer-managed key.")
     ```

3. GCP:
   - Install and configure Google Cloud SDK for Python.
   - Use the `list` method of the `Disks` class to get a list of all disks.
   - For each disk, check the `disk_encryption_key` attribute. If the `kms_key_name` is not set, the disk is not using a customer-managed key.
   - Python script:
     ```python
     from google.cloud import compute_v1
     client = compute_v1.DisksClient()
     disks = client.list(project=project_id, zone=zone)
     for disk in disks:
         if not disk.disk_encryption_key.kms_key_name:
             print(f"Disk {disk.name} is not using a customer-managed key.")
     ```
Please replace `credentials`, `subscription_id`, `project_id`, and `zone` with your actual values.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not using BYOK for disk volume encryption in Azure, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the "Key Vaults" menu and create a new Key Vault if you do not have an existing one.
3. In the "Key Vaults" menu, select the Key Vault that you want to use for BYOK.
4. In the Key Vault, select the "Keys" menu and create a new key.
5. Provide a name for the key, select "RSA" as the key type, and provide a key size of at least 2048 bits.
6. Select the "BYOK" option under "Key Options" and provide the URI of your on-premises key management service (KMS).
7. Save the key and take note of the key identifier (URI) for later use.
8. Navigate to the "Disks" menu and select the disk that you want to encrypt using BYOK.
9. Under the "Encryption" tab, select "Disk encryption set" and click "Create new".
10. Provide a name for the disk encryption set and select the Key Vault that you created in step 2.
11. In the "Key management" section, select "Bring your own key (BYOK)" and provide the key identifier (URI) that you noted in step 7.
12. Save the disk encryption set and wait for the encryption process to complete.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration by using BYOK for disk volume encryption in Azure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of not using Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) for Disk Volumes Encryption on Azure using Azure CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Create a new Key Vault in Azure or use an existing one.

2. Create a new Key in the Key Vault or use an existing one.

3. Grant the Disk Encryption Set (DES) access to the Key Vault and Key.

4. Enable disk encryption using the Key Vault and Key.

The following are the detailed steps to remediate the misconfiguration:

Step 1: Create a new Key Vault in Azure or use an existing one

Use the below command to create a new Key Vault in Azure:

```
az keyvault create --name "key-vault-name" --resource-group "resource-group-name" --location "location"
```

Replace "key-vault-name" with the name of the Key Vault, "resource-group-name" with the name of the resource group, and "location" with the location of the Key Vault.

Step 2: Create a new Key in the Key Vault or use an existing one

Use the below command to create a new Key in the Key Vault:

```
az keyvault key create --vault-name "key-vault-name" --name "key-name" --protection software --size 2048
```

Replace "key-vault-name" with the name of the Key Vault and "key-name" with the name of the Key.

Step 3: Grant the Disk Encryption Set (DES) access to the Key Vault and Key

Use the below command to grant the Disk Encryption Set (DES) access to the Key Vault:

```
az keyvault set-policy --name "key-vault-name" --object-id "object-id" --key-permissions "wrapkey" --secret-permissions "set"
```

Replace "key-vault-name" with the name of the Key Vault and "object-id" with the object ID of the Disk Encryption Set (DES).

Use the below command to grant the Disk Encryption Set (DES) access to the Key:

```
az keyvault set-policy --name "key-vault-name" --object-id "object-id" --key-permissions "get" --secret-permissions "get"
```

Replace "key-vault-name" with the name of the Key Vault and "object-id" with the object ID of the Disk Encryption Set (DES).

Step 4: Enable disk encryption using the Key Vault and Key

Use the below command to enable disk encryption using the Key Vault and Key:

```
az disk encryption set update --resource-group "resource-group-name" --name "disk-encryption-set-name" --key-url "key-url" --key-vault-id "key-vault-id"
```

Replace "resource-group-name" with the name of the resource group, "disk-encryption-set-name" with the name of the Disk Encryption Set (DES), "key-url" with the URL of the Key, and "key-vault-id" with the ID of the Key Vault.

After following these steps, the misconfiguration of not using BYOK for Disk Volumes Encryption on Azure using Azure CLI will be remediated.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of not using BYOK for Disk Volumes Encryption in AZURE using Python, follow the steps below:

1. First, you need to create a new key vault in Azure. To create a key vault, you can use the `azure-mgmt-keyvault` Python package. Install the package using the following command:

   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-keyvault
   ```

   Then, use the following code snippet to create a new key vault:

   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.keyvault import KeyVaultManagementClient
   from azure.mgmt.keyvault.models import VaultCreateOrUpdateParameters, Sku, AccessPolicyEntry, Permissions, SecretPermissions

   # Set the subscription ID and resource group name
   subscription_id = '<your-subscription-id>'
   resource_group_name = '<your-resource-group-name>'

   # Set the key vault name and region
   vault_name = '<your-key-vault-name>'
   region = '<your-region>'

   # Create the key vault management client
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   keyvault_client = KeyVaultManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

   # Set the SKU and access policies for the key vault
   sku = Sku(name='standard', family='A')
   access_policy = AccessPolicyEntry(
       tenant_id='<your-tenant-id>',
       object_id='<your-object-id>',
       permissions=Permissions(
           secrets=[SecretPermissions.get, SecretPermissions.list, SecretPermissions.set]
       )
   )

   # Create the key vault parameters
   parameters = VaultCreateOrUpdateParameters(
       location=region,
       properties={
           'sku': sku,
           'access_policies': [access_policy]
       }
   )

   # Create the key vault
   keyvault_client.vaults.create_or_update(resource_group_name, vault_name, parameters)
   ```

2. Next, you need to create a new key in the key vault. To create a new key, you can use the `azure-keyvault-keys` Python package. Install the package using the following command:

   ```
   pip install azure-keyvault-keys
   ```

   Then, use the following code snippet to create a new key:

   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.keyvault.keys import KeyClient
   from azure.keyvault.keys.crypto import CryptographyClient, EncryptionAlgorithm

   # Set the key vault URL and key name
   key_vault_url = f'https://{vault_name}.vault.azure.net/'
   key_name = '<your-key-name>'

   # Create the key client and cryptography client
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   key_client = KeyClient(key_vault_url, credential)
   crypto_client = CryptographyClient(key_client.get_key(key_name).id, credential)

   # Generate a new RSA key pair
   key_size = 2048
   key_ops = ['encrypt', 'decrypt']
   key = key_client.create_rsa_key(name=key_name, size=key_size, key_operations=key_ops)

   # Encrypt a test message using the new key
   message = b'This is a test message.'
   encrypted_message = crypto_client.encrypt(EncryptionAlgorithm.rsa_oaep, message)
   ```

3. Finally, you need to enable BYOK for disk volume encryption in Azure. To do this, you can use the `azure-mgmt-compute` Python package. Install the package using the following command:

   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-compute
   ```

   Then, use the following code snippet to enable BYOK for disk volume encryption:

   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
   from azure.mgmt.compute.models import DiskEncryptionSetParameters, EncryptionSetIdentity

   # Set the subscription ID and resource group name
   subscription_id = '<your-subscription-id>'
   resource_group_name = '<your-resource-group-name>'

   # Set the disk encryption set name and key vault URL
   disk_encryption_set_name = '<your-disk-encryption-set-name>'
   key_vault_url = f'https://{vault_name}.vault.azure.net/'

   # Create the compute management client
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

   # Create the disk encryption set parameters
   identity = EncryptionSetIdentity(type='UserAssigned', user_assigned_identities={
       f'/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group_name}/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/{key_name}': {}
   })
   parameters = DiskEncryptionSetParameters(
       identity=identity,
       key_vault_uri=key_vault_url
   )

   # Create the disk encryption set
   compute_client.disk_encryption_sets.create_or_update(resource_group_name, disk_encryption_set_name, parameters)
   ```

   Note that you need to replace the placeholders `<your-subscription-id>`, `<your-resource-group-name>`, `<your-key-vault-name>`, `<your-region>`, `<your-tenant-id>`, `<your-object-id>`, `<your-key-name>`, `<your-disk-encryption-set-name>` with your own values.
