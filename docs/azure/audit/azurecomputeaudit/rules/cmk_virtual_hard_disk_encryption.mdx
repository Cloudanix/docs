### More Info:

Ensure that your Microsoft Azure Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) volumes are using Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) instead of Platform-Managed Keys (PMKs â€“ default keys used by Microsoft Azure for disk encryption) in order to have full control over your VHD data encryption and decryption process. Virtual Hard Disks are the old style disks that were attached to Azure virtual machines (VMs). VHDs are stored in blob storage accounts.
