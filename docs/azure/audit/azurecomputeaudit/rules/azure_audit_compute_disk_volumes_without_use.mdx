### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal by entering "https://portal.azure.com" in your web browser. Enter your login credentials to access your Azure account.

2. Navigate to Disks: Once you are logged in, go to the left-hand side menu and click on "All services". In the new window, search for "Disks" in the search bar and select it. This will open the Disks page where you can see all the disk volumes associated with your Azure account.

3. Check Disk State: In the Disks page, you will see a list of all the disk volumes. Check the "Disk State" column for each disk. If the Disk State is "Unattached", it means that the disk volume is not attached to any virtual machine.

4. Filter Unattached Disks: For a more streamlined view, you can filter the disks to only show the unattached ones. Click on "Filter by" at the top of the Disks page, select "Disk State" and then select "Unattached". This will show only the unattached disk volumes.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Azure CLI: Before you can start detecting misconfigurations, you need to have Azure CLI installed and configured on your system. You can download it from the official Azure website and configure it using the command `az login`. This will prompt you to enter your Azure credentials.

2. List all the disks: Once you have Azure CLI configured, you can list all the disks in your subscription using the command `az disk list --query "[?diskState=='Unattached']"`. This command will return a list of all the disks that are currently unattached.

3. Check the disk state: From the list of disks returned in the previous step, you can check the state of each disk using the command `az disk show --name {disk-name} --resource-group {resource-group-name} --query "diskState"`. Replace `{disk-name}` and `{resource-group-name}` with the name of the disk and the resource group respectively. This command will return the state of the disk. If the state is 'Unattached', then the disk is not attached to any virtual machine.

4. Output the results: To make it easier to review the results, you can output the list of unattached disks to a file using the command `az disk list --query "[?diskState=='Unattached']" > unattached_disks.txt`. This command will create a text file named 'unattached_disks.txt' containing the list of all unattached disks.

#### Using Python

1. AWS:
   - Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).
   - Use the `describe_volumes` method to list all EBS volumes.
   - Filter the volumes where the `Attachments` list is empty. This will give you the unattached volumes.
   ```python
   import boto3
   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
   volumes = ec2.volumes.all()
   unattached_volumes = [volume for volume in volumes if not volume.attachments]
   print(unattached_volumes)
   ```

2. Azure:
   - Install and configure Azure SDK for Python.
   - Use the `list_all` method from `DiskOperations` class to list all disk volumes.
   - Filter the disks where the `managed_by` property is None. This will give you the unattached disks.
   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
   compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
   disks = compute_client.disks.list_all()
   unattached_disks = [disk for disk in disks if disk.managed_by is None]
   print(unattached_disks)
   ```

3. GCP:
   - Install and configure Google Cloud SDK for Python.
   - Use the `list` method from `Disks` class to list all disk volumes.
   - Filter the disks where the `users` list is empty. This will give you the unattached disks.
   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1
   client = compute_v1.DisksClient()
   disks = client.list(project=project, zone=zone)
   unattached_disks = [disk for disk in disks if not disk.users]
   print(unattached_disks)
   ```
   
Note: Replace `credentials`, `subscription_id`, `project`, and `zone` with your actual values.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "Remove Unattached Virtual Machine Disk Volumes" for Azure using Azure console:

1. Log in to your Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. In the left-hand menu, click on "Virtual machines".
3. Select the virtual machine that has unattached disk volumes.
4. In the virtual machine's overview page, scroll down to the "Disks" section and click on it.
5. You will see a list of all the disks attached to the virtual machine. Identify the unattached disk volumes that need to be removed.
6. Click on the unattached disk volume that you want to remove.
7. In the disk's overview page, click on the "Delete" button at the top of the page.
8. A confirmation message will appear. Click on "Yes" to confirm the deletion of the unattached disk volume.
9. Repeat steps 6-8 for all the unattached disk volumes that need to be removed.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the "Remove Unattached Virtual Machine Disk Volumes" misconfiguration for Azure using Azure console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Remove Unattached Virtual Machine Disk Volumes" for Azure using Azure CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI on your local machine or use the Azure Cloud Shell.

2. Login to your Azure account using the command: 
   ```
   az login
   ```

3. Once you are logged in, set the subscription context where the virtual machines are located using the command: 
   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
   ```
   Replace `<subscription_id>` with the ID of the subscription where the virtual machines are located.

4. Now, list all the virtual machines in the subscription using the command: 
   ```
   az vm list --query "[].{Name:name, ResourceGroup:resourceGroup, Location:location}" --output table
   ```

5. Identify the virtual machine for which you want to remove the unattached disk volumes.

6. Run the following command to list all the disk volumes attached to the virtual machine: 
   ```
   az vm show -g <resource_group_name> -n <vm_name> --query "storageProfile.dataDisks[].name" --output table
   ```
   Replace `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group where the virtual machine is located and `<vm_name>` with the name of the virtual machine.

7. Identify any unattached disk volumes in the output of the above command.

8. To remove the unattached disk volumes, run the following command: 
   ```
   az disk delete --ids <disk_id>
   ```
   Replace `<disk_id>` with the ID of the unattached disk volume that you want to remove.

9. Repeat steps 6 to 8 for all the unattached disk volumes that you want to remove.

10. Once you have removed all the unattached disk volumes, verify that they have been removed by running the command in step 6 again.

11. Exit the Azure CLI using the command: 
   ```
   exit
   ```

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Remove Unattached Virtual Machine Disk Volumes" for Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of removing unattached virtual machine disk volumes in Azure using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Import the required libraries

```
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
```

Step 2: Set the subscription ID and resource group name where the virtual machines are located.

```
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
resource_group_name = 'your-resource-group-name'
```

Step 3: Authenticate the client using the DefaultAzureCredential.

```
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

Step 4: Get the list of virtual machines in the resource group.

```
virtual_machines = compute_client.virtual_machines.list(resource_group_name)
```

Step 5: Iterate through each virtual machine and get the list of disk volumes.

```
for vm in virtual_machines:
    disk_volumes = compute_client.disks.list_by_vm(resource_group_name, vm.name)
```

Step 6: Check if the disk volume is attached to the virtual machine or not. If it is not attached, delete the disk volume.

```
    for disk in disk_volumes:
        if not disk.managed_by and not disk.disk_state:
            compute_client.disks.delete(resource_group_name, disk.name)
```

Step 7: Run the script to remove the unattached virtual machine disk volumes.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to delete the disk volumes.

The above steps will help you remediate the misconfiguration of removing unattached virtual machine disk volumes in Azure using Python.
