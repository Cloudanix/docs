### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Navigate to Virtual Machine Scale Sets: On the left-hand side menu, click on "All services". In the "All services" box, type "Virtual Machine Scale Sets" in the search bar and select it.

3. Check for Zone-Redundant Virtual Machine Scale Sets: Once you are in the "Virtual Machine Scale Sets" page, you will see a list of all your VM Scale Sets. Click on each of the VM Scale Sets to open its overview page. In the "Essentials" section, look for the "Availability zones" field. If the field is empty or has only one zone listed, it means that the VM Scale Set is not zone-redundant.

4. Repeat the process: Repeat the process for all the VM Scale Sets in your Azure account. Make sure to check each one individually to ensure that all of them are zone-redundant.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal and type `az login` to log in to your Azure account.

2. List all Virtual Machine Scale Sets: Use the following command to list all the Virtual Machine Scale Sets in your Azure account.

   ```
   az vmss list --query "[].{Name:name, ResourceGroup:resourceGroup, Location:location, Zone:zones}" -o table
   ```
   This command will display a table with the names of all VM Scale Sets, their resource groups, locations, and zones.

3. Check for Zone-Redundant Virtual Machine Scale Sets: In the output table from the previous step, check the 'Zone' column. If a Virtual Machine Scale Set is zone-redundant, it will have more than one zone listed in this column. If it only has one zone, it is not zone-redundant.

4. Check for Zone-Redundant Virtual Machine Scale Sets in a specific resource group: If you want to check for zone-redundant VM Scale Sets in a specific resource group, you can use the following command:

   ```
   az vmss list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --query "[].{Name:name, ResourceGroup:resourceGroup, Location:location, Zone:zones}" -o table
   ```
   Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of your resource group. This command will display a table with the names of all VM Scale Sets in the specified resource group, along with their locations and zones. Again, check the 'Zone' column to see if a VM Scale Set is zone-redundant.

#### Using Python

1. Install Azure SDK for Python: Azure SDK for Python is a set of libraries that you can use to interact with Azure services. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install azure-mgmt-compute
   ```

2. Import necessary libraries and authenticate: Import the necessary libraries and authenticate to your Azure account. You will need to provide your subscription ID, tenant ID, client ID, and client secret.

   ```python
   from azure.identity import ClientSecretCredential
   from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient

   subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
   credentials = ClientSecretCredential(
       client_id='your-client-id',
       client_secret='your-client-secret',
       tenant_id='your-tenant-id'
   )

   compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
   ```

3. List all Virtual Machine Scale Sets: Use the `virtual_machine_scale_sets.list_all()` method to get a list of all VMSS in your subscription.

   ```python
   vmss_list = compute_client.virtual_machine_scale_sets.list_all()
   ```

4. Check for Zone-Redundant VMSS: Iterate over the list of VMSS and check the `zones` property. If a VMSS is zone-redundant, it will have more than one zone in this property.

   ```python
   for vmss in vmss_list:
       if not vmss.zones or len(vmss.zones) < 2:
           print(f"VMSS {vmss.name} is not zone-redundant.")
   ```

This script will print the names of all VMSS that are not zone-redundant. You can modify it to suit your needs, for example by writing the results to a file or sending an alert.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate Zone-Redundant Virtual Machine Scale Sets misconfiguration in Azure:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com).
2. Navigate to the Virtual Machine Scale Sets resource that needs to be remediated.
3. In the left-hand menu, select "Settings" and then select "Properties".
4. In the "Properties" pane, scroll down to the "Availability" section.
5. In the "Availability" section, check if "Zone Redundancy" is set to "Enabled". If it is enabled, then the Scale Set is configured to use Zone-Redundant Virtual Machines.
6. To remediate this misconfiguration, disable the "Zone Redundancy" option by toggling the switch to "Disabled".
7. Once the "Zone Redundancy" option is disabled, click on the "Save" button at the top of the "Properties" pane to save the changes.

Congratulations! You have successfully remediated the Zone-Redundant Virtual Machine Scale Sets misconfiguration in Azure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the Zone-Redundant Virtual Machine Scale Sets misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI in your terminal or command prompt.

2. Login to your Azure account using the following command:
   ```
   az login
   ```

3. Once you are logged in, set the subscription to the one where the affected Virtual Machine Scale Set is located using the following command:
   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
   ```

4. Check the current configuration of the Virtual Machine Scale Set using the following command:
   ```
   az vmss show --name <vmss_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name>
   ```

5. If the Virtual Machine Scale Set is configured for Zone-Redundancy, you can remediate it by disabling the Zone-Redundant deployment using the following command:
   ```
   az vmss update --name <vmss_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --set singlePlacementGroup=false
   ```

6. Once the command executes successfully, the Virtual Machine Scale Set will be updated to disable the Zone-Redundant deployment.

7. Verify the updated configuration of the Virtual Machine Scale Set using the following command:
   ```
   az vmss show --name <vmss_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name>
   ```

8. You have now successfully remediated the Zone-Redundant Virtual Machine Scale Sets misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Zone-Redundant Virtual Machine Scale Sets misconfiguration in Azure using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
```

2. Instantiate the ComputeManagementClient and DefaultAzureCredential objects:

```
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

3. Use the `list` method of the `compute_client.virtual_machine_scale_sets` object to get a list of all Virtual Machine Scale Sets in the subscription:

```
vmss_list = compute_client.virtual_machine_scale_sets.list()
```

4. For each Virtual Machine Scale Set in the list, check if it is configured to use Zone-Redundant deployment by checking the `zones` property:

```
for vmss in vmss_list:
    if vmss.zones is not None:
        # Zone-Redundant deployment is enabled
        # Remediation steps go here
```

5. To remediate the issue, update the Virtual Machine Scale Set to use a non-Zone-Redundant deployment by setting the `zones` property to `None`:

```
vmss.zones = None
compute_client.virtual_machine_scale_sets.create_or_update(resource_group_name, vmss_name, vmss)
```

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for all Virtual Machine Scale Sets that have Zone-Redundant deployment enabled.

Note: Make sure to replace the `subscription_id`, `resource_group_name`, and `vmss_name` variables with the appropriate values for your Azure environment. Also, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify Virtual Machine Scale Sets in your subscription.
