### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to the Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) service. 

2. Select the VMSS instance for which you want to check the instance termination notifications. 

3. In the VMSS instance page, navigate to the "Settings" section and then click on "Scaling".

4. In the "Scaling" section, check the "Instance Termination Notification" setting. If it is enabled, you will see the notification settings configured. If it is not enabled, there will be no configuration present.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use the Azure CLI commands, you need to have the Azure CLI installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official Azure website.

2. Login to Azure: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be prompted to enter your username and password.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. List all Virtual Machine Scale Sets: Use the following command to list all the Virtual Machine Scale Sets in your Azure account. This will return a JSON object with details about each scale set.
   ```
   az vmss list --query "[].{Name:name, ResourceGroup:resourceGroup}"
   ```
4. Check Instance Termination Notifications: Unfortunately, Azure CLI does not currently support a direct command to check if Instance Termination Notifications are enabled for Virtual Machine Scale Sets. However, you can check the 'enableTerminateNotification' property in the scale set model for each scale set using Azure SDK for Python or other SDKs. If the property is set to 'true', then Instance Termination Notifications are enabled. If it's 'false' or not present, then they are not enabled.

#### Using Python

To check if Instance Termination Notifications are enabled for Virtual Machine Scale Sets in Azure Compute, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Azure SDK for Python**: You need to install the Azure SDK for Python if it's not already installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```python
   pip install azure-mgmt-compute
   ```
2. **Authenticate with Azure**: Before you can interact with Azure resources, you need to authenticate. You can use Azure Identity library for this. Here is an example of how to authenticate:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, "<your_subscription_id>")
   ```
3. **List all Virtual Machine Scale Sets**: You can list all the Virtual Machine Scale Sets in your subscription using the `virtual_machine_scale_sets` property of the `ComputeManagementClient` object:
   ```python
   vmss_list = compute_client.virtual_machine_scale_sets.list_all()
   ```
4. **Check for Instance Termination Notifications**: You can check if Instance Termination Notifications are enabled for each Virtual Machine Scale Set by checking the `terminate_notification_profile` property of each VMSS object. If this property is `None`, then Instance Termination Notifications are not enabled:
   ```python
   for vmss in vmss_list:
       if vmss.terminate_notification_profile is None:
           print(f"Instance Termination Notifications are not enabled for VMSS: {vmss.name}")
   ```
Please replace `<your_subscription_id>` with your actual Azure subscription ID.

With these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Enable Instance Termination Notifications For Virtual Machine Scale Sets" in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Enable Instance Termination Notifications For Virtual Machine Scale Sets" for AZURE using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```python
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import ActionGroup, ActionGroupPatchBody, ActionGroupResource
```

2. Authenticate the client:

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

3. Get the VM Scale Set ID:

```python
vmss = compute_client.virtual_machine_scale_set_vms.list(resource_group_name, vm_scale_set_name)
vmss_id = vmss.next().id
```

4. Create an action group:
