### More Info:

Ensure that your Microsoft Azure virtual machine (VM) data volumes (i.e. non-boot volumes) are encrypted using Azure Disk Encryption in order to meet security and compliance requirements. ADE encrypts the OS and data disks of Azure virtual machines (VMs) inside your VMs using the CPU via the DM-Crypt feature for Linux or the BitLocker feature for Windows. ADE is integrated with Azure Key Vault to help you control and manage the disk encryption keys and secrets. The VM data volume encryption and decryption is handled transparently and does not require any additional action from you, your Azure virtual machine, or your application.

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Navigate to the Virtual Machines: From the left-hand menu, select "Virtual Machines" to view the list of all the virtual machines associated with your Azure account.

3. Select a Virtual Machine: Click on the name of the virtual machine for which you want to check the disk encryption. This will open the virtual machine's dashboard.

4. Check Disk Encryption: In the virtual machine's dashboard, select "Disks" from the left-hand menu. Here, you can see all the disks associated with the virtual machine. Click on each disk to view its configuration details. In the disk's configuration details, look for the "Disk state" field. If the disk is encrypted, it will show "Encrypted". If it's not encrypted, it will show "Not Encrypted".

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download and install Azure CLI from the official Microsoft Azure website.

2. Login to Azure Account: After installing Azure CLI, open your command prompt and type the following command to login to your Azure account:

   ```
   az login
   ```
   Follow the instructions to complete the login process.

3. List all the VMs: Once you are logged in, you can list all the VMs in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   az vm list --query "[].{name:name}" -o table
   ```
   This command will list all the VMs in your account in a table format.

4. Check Disk Encryption: Now, for each VM, you can check if the non-boot disks are encrypted or not by running the following command:

   ```
   az vm show --name <VM_NAME> --query "storageProfile.dataDisks[].encryptionSettings"
   ```
   Replace `<VM_NAME>` with the name of your VM. This command will show the encryption settings for all the non-boot disks of the specified VM. If the encryption settings are null or not enabled, then the non-boot disks are not encrypted.

#### Using Python

1. Install Azure SDK: To interact with Azure resources, you need to install Azure SDK in your python environment. You can do this by running the command `pip install azure-mgmt-compute`.

2. Authenticate with Azure: Before you can interact with Azure resources, you need to authenticate. You can do this using Azure CLI or by creating a service principal and using it to authenticate. Here is a sample code to authenticate using a service principal:

```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

def get_credentials():
    tenant_id = 'your-tenant-id'
    client_id = 'your-client-id'
    secret = 'your-secret'
    credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
        client_id=client_id,
        secret=secret,
        tenant=tenant_id
    )
    return credentials
```

3. Get a list of all disks: Once you are authenticated, you can get a list of all disks in your subscription. Here is a sample code to do this:

```python
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient

def get_all_disks(credentials):
    subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
    compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
    all_disks = compute_client.disks.list()
    return all_disks
```

4. Check if disk encryption is enabled: For each disk, you can check if encryption is enabled. If encryption is not enabled, then it is a misconfiguration. Here is a sample code to do this:

```python
def check_disk_encryption(all_disks):
    for disk in all_disks:
        if not disk.encryption_settings_collection:
            print(f"Disk {disk.name} does not have encryption enabled.")
```

You can then call these functions in your main function like this:

```python
def main():
    credentials = get_credentials()
    all_disks = get_all_disks(credentials)
    check_disk_encryption(all_disks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will print the names of all disks that do not have encryption enabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the Azure Disk Encryption misconfiguration for non-boot disk using the Azure console:

1. Open the Azure portal and navigate to the virtual machine that you want to remediate.

2. In the virtual machine's menu, click on the "Disks" option.

3. Identify the non-boot disk that needs to be encrypted and click on it.

4. In the disk's menu, click on the "Disk encryption" option.

5. In the "Disk encryption" page, click on the "Enable" button to start the encryption process.

6. In the "Encryption settings" page, select the encryption type and the key vault that you want to use for encryption.

7. If you don't have a key vault, you can create one by clicking on the "Create new" button and following the prompts.

8. Once you have selected the encryption type and key vault, click on the "Review + Create" button to review the settings.

9. In the "Review + Create" page, review the settings and click on the "Create" button to start the encryption process.

10. The encryption process may take some time to complete depending on the size of the disk. Once the encryption process is complete, you will see a "Disk encryption is enabled" message in the disk's menu.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the Azure Disk Encryption misconfiguration for the non-boot disk using the Azure console.

#### Using CLI

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the Azure Disk Encryption misconfiguration for non-boot disks using Azure CLI:

1. Open the Azure CLI and login to your Azure account using the command `az login`.

2. Once you are logged in, check if you have the necessary permissions to perform disk encryption using the command `az disk-encryption-set list`.

3. Next, you need to create a new encryption set using the command `az disk-encryption-set create`. You will need to specify the name of the encryption set, the resource group, and the location.

4. After creating the encryption set, you need to enable encryption for the non-boot disk using the command `az disk update`. You will need to specify the name of the disk, the resource group, and the ID of the encryption set.

5. Finally, you can verify that the disk encryption is enabled using the command `az disk show`. This will display the disk details, including the encryption status.

Here is an example command to enable encryption for a non-boot disk:

```
az disk update --name <disk-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --encryption-type "EncryptionAtRestWithPlatformKey" --disk-encryption-set <encryption-set-id>
```

Note: The `encryption-type` parameter is set to "EncryptionAtRestWithPlatformKey" which means encryption will be done using the Azure platform key. You can also use "EncryptionAtRestWithCustomerKey" to use your own customer-managed key for encryption.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Azure Disk Encryption misconfiguration for non-boot disk using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python and import the required modules:

```
pip install azure
pip install azure-mgmt-compute
pip install azure-mgmt-storage
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.storage import StorageManagementClient
```

2. Authenticate and create a client object for the Azure Compute and Storage Management APIs:

```
TENANT_ID = '<your tenant id>'
CLIENT_ID = '<your client id>'
CLIENT_SECRET = '<your client secret>'
SUBSCRIPTION_ID = '<your subscription id>'

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=CLIENT_ID,
    secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
    tenant=TENANT_ID
)

compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credentials, SUBSCRIPTION_ID)
storage_client = StorageManagementClient(credentials, SUBSCRIPTION_ID)
```

3. Get the list of all the virtual machines in the subscription:

```
vm_list = compute_client.virtual_machines.list_all()
```

4. For each virtual machine, check if it has any non-boot disks that are not encrypted:

```
for vm in vm_list:
    for disk in vm.storage_profile.data_disks:
        disk_id = disk.managed_disk.id
        disk_resource_group = disk_id.split('/')[4]
        disk_name = disk_id.split('/')[-1]
        disk_info = storage_client.disks.get(disk_resource_group, disk_name)
        
        if not disk_info.encryption:
            # Encrypt the disk
```

5. To encrypt the non-boot disk, update the disk resource with encryption settings:

```
encryption_settings = {
    'disk_encryption_key': {
        'source_vault': {
            'id': '<your key vault id>'
        },
        'secret_url': '<your secret url>'
    },
    'key_encryption_key': {
        'source_vault': {
            'id': '<your key vault id>'
        },
        'key_url': '<your key url>',
        'key_version': '<your key version>'
    }
}

disk_info.encryption = encryption_settings
storage_client.disks.create_or_update(disk_resource_group, disk_name, disk_info)
```

6. Save the script and run it to remediate the Azure Disk Encryption misconfiguration for non-boot disks.

Note: Replace the placeholders `<your tenant id>`, `<your client id>`, `<your client secret>`, `<your subscription id>`, `<your key vault id>`, `<your secret url>`, `<your key url>`, and `<your key version>` with your actual values.
