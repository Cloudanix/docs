### More Info:

Ensure that Monitor Application Health feature is enabled for all the instances running within your Azure virtual machine scale set. Health monitoring via Application Health extension is required for OS upgrades and automatic instance repairs. The Azure Application Health extension reports on the application health from inside the virtual machine scale set instances. You can configure the health extension to probe on an application endpoint and update the status of the application on that instance.
