#### Using CLI

To enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for App Service Instances in Azure using Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI command prompt.

2. Log in to your Azure account using the following command:

   ```
   az login
   ```

3. Select the subscription that contains the App Service Instance you want to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for using the following command:

   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
   ```

4. Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for the App Service Instance using the following command:

   ```
   az webapp update --name <app_service_instance_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --set properties.siteAuthEnabled=true
   ```

   This command sets the `siteAuthEnabled` property of the App Service Instance to `true`, which enables Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

5. Verify that Microsoft Defender for Cloud is enabled for the App Service Instance using the following command:

   ```
   az webapp show --name <app_service_instance_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --query 'properties.siteAuthEnabled'
   ```

   This command returns the value `true` if Microsoft Defender for Cloud is enabled for the App Service Instance.

That's it! You have successfully enabled Microsoft Defender for Cloud for the App Service Instance in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for App Service Instances in Azure using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.web.models import SiteConfigResource
```

2. Authenticate using Azure credentials:
```
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
resource_group_name = 'your-resource-group-name'
webapp_name = 'your-webapp-name'

web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

3. Get the current site configuration:
```
site_config = web_client.web_apps.get_configuration(resource_group_name, webapp_name)
```

4. Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud by setting the `webSiteManagementEndpointEnabled` property to `True`:
```
site_config.site_auth_enabled = True
site_config.windows_fx_version = "DOCKER|mcr.microsoft.com/azure-security/defender-appsvc:latest"
site_config.app_command_line = "java -jar /home/site/wwwroot/defender/defender.jar"
site_config.linux_fx_version = "DOCKER|mcr.microsoft.com/azure-security/defender-appsvc:latest"
site_config.webSiteManagementEndpointEnabled = True
```

5. Update the site configuration:
```
web_client.web_apps.update_configuration(resource_group_name, webapp_name, site_config)
```

After executing these steps, Microsoft Defender for Cloud will be enabled for the App Service Instance in Azure.
