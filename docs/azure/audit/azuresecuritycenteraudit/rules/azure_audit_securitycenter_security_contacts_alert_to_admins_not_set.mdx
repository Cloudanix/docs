<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Sending Email to Administrators on Alert Is Off" in Azure using Azure CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the Azure CLI and login to your Azure account using the command:
```
az login
```

Step 2: Once you are logged in, set the subscription in which the alert is created using the command:
```
az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
```

Step 3: Get the list of all the alert rules configured in the subscription using the command:
```
az monitor metrics alert list-rules --resource-group <resource_group_name>
```

Step 4: Identify the alert rule for which the "Sending Email to Administrators on Alert Is Off" misconfiguration exists.

Step 5: Update the alert rule to enable sending email to administrators on alert using the command:
```
az monitor metrics alert update --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <alert_rule_name> --email-service-owners true
```

Step 6: Verify the update by checking the alert rule configuration using the command:
```
az monitor metrics alert show --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <alert_rule_name>
```

Step 7: Once you have verified the update, the misconfiguration "Sending Email to Administrators on Alert Is Off" would have been remediated.

Note: In Step 5, replace `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group in which the alert rule is created, `<alert_rule_name>` with the name of the alert rule for which the misconfiguration exists, and `true` with `false` to disable sending email to administrators on alert.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Sending Email to Administrators on Alert Is Off" for Azure using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Import necessary libraries and authenticate to Azure.

```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import ActionGroupPatchBody, EmailReceiver

subscription_id = '<Subscription ID>'
client_id = '<Client ID>'
secret = '<Client Secret>'
tenant = '<Tenant ID>'

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=client_id,
    secret=secret,
    tenant=tenant
)

monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
```

Step 2: Get the action groups and check if the email receiver is enabled or not.

```python
action_groups = monitor_client.action_groups.list()
for action_group in action_groups:
    if action_group.email_receivers is not None:
        for email_receiver in action_group.email_receivers:
            if email_receiver.name == 'Administrators':
                if email_receiver.enabled is False:
                    print('Email receiver for Administrators is disabled')
```

Step 3: Enable the email receiver for the Administrators group.

```python
action_group_patch = ActionGroupPatchBody(
    email_receivers=[
        EmailReceiver(
            name='Administrators',
            email_address='<Email Address>',
            use_common_alert_schema=True,
            enabled=True
        )
    ]
)

monitor_client.action_groups.update(
    resource_group_name='<Resource Group Name>',
    action_group_name='<Action Group Name>',
    parameters=action_group_patch
)
```

Replace the placeholders `<Subscription ID>`, `<Client ID>`, `<Client Secret>`, `<Tenant ID>`, `<Email Address>`, `<Resource Group Name>`, and `<Action Group Name>` with the appropriate values.

Note: This solution assumes that the action group and email receiver for the Administrators group already exist. If they don't exist, you can create them using the Azure Portal or the Azure SDK for Python.
