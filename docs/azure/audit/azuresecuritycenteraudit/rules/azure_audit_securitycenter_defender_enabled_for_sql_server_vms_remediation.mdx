#### Using Python

1. Install Azure SDK: To interact with Azure services, you need to install Azure SDK for Python. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-security
   ```
2. Import Required Libraries: Import the necessary libraries into your Python script.
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter
   ```
3. Authenticate and Initialize Security Center: Use the DefaultAzureCredential class for authentication and initialize the SecurityCenter client.
   ```python
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
   asc_client = SecurityCenter(credential, subscription_id)
   ```
4. Check Microsoft Defender for Cloud: Now, you can use the asc_client to check the status of Microsoft Defender for Cloud for SQL Server Virtual Machines. The following script will list all the security settings and you can look for the specific setting related to Microsoft Defender.
   ```python
   settings = asc_client.settings.list()
   for setting in settings:
       if setting.name == 'MCAS':
           print(f"Microsoft Defender for Cloud is {'enabled' if setting.enabled else 'disabled'}")
   ```
Please replace 'your-subscription-id' with your actual Azure subscription ID. This script will print whether Microsoft Defender for Cloud is enabled or not. If it doesn't print anything, it means the setting is not configured.
