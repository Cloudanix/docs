### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to portal.azure.com and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Open Security Center: On the left-hand side menu, click on "Security Center". This will open the Azure Security Center dashboard.

3. Navigate to the Security Policy: In the Security Center dashboard, click on "Security policy" under the "Management" section. This will open a list of your subscriptions.

4. Check SQL Encryption settings: Click on your subscription. This will open the security policy settings for your subscription. Scroll down to the "Data" section and look for "Monitor SQL Encryption in Azure Security Center". If it's not enabled, it means the SQL Encryption setting is not being monitored.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal.

2. Login to Azure Account: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be redirected to the browser for login. Enter your Azure account credentials.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, select the subscription where you want to check the SQL Encryption setting. Use the following command to set the subscription.
   ```
   az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"
   ```
4. Check SQL Encryption Setting: Use the following command to check the SQL Encryption setting in the Security Center. Replace 'your-resource-group' and 'your-sql-server' with your actual resource group and SQL server names.
   ```
   az sql server transparent-data-encryption show --name "your-sql-server" --resource-group "your-resource-group" --query status
   ```
   If the output is 'Enabled', then SQL Encryption is enabled. If the output is 'Disabled', then SQL Encryption is not enabled.

#### Using Python

To check if the Monitor SQL Encryption setting is not enabled in Azure Security Center using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Azure SDK for Python**: Azure SDK for Python is a set of libraries that allow you to manage your Azure resources. To install it, you can use pip:
   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-security
   ```
2. **Authenticate to Azure**: Before you can interact with Azure resources, you need to authenticate. You can use Azure Identity library for this. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   security_center = SecurityCenter(credential, "<subscription_id>")
   ```
   Replace `<subscription_id>` with your Azure subscription ID.

3. **Get Security Center Settings**: You can use the `security_center.settings.get()` method to get the settings. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   setting = security_center.settings.get(setting_name="MCAS")
   print(setting)
   ```
   This will print the settings in JSON format. You can then parse this JSON to check if the Monitor SQL Encryption setting is enabled or not.

4. **Check Monitor SQL Encryption Setting**: You can parse the JSON output from the previous step to check the setting. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   if setting.parameters["monitorSqlEncryption"] == "Disabled":
       print("Monitor SQL Encryption setting is not enabled.")
   else:
       print("Monitor SQL Encryption setting is enabled.")
   ```
   This will print whether the Monitor SQL Encryption setting is enabled or not.

Please note that you need appropriate permissions to read the Security Center settings. If you don't have these permissions, you will need to ask your Azure administrator to grant them to you.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Monitor SQL Encryption setting is not enabled" misconfiguration in AZURE using the AZURE console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the AZURE portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the "SQL servers" option from the left navigation pane.
3. Select the SQL server for which you want to enable the encryption setting.
4. Click on the "Security" option from the left navigation pane.
5. Select the "Auditing & Threat detection" option.
6. Click on the "Advanced Threat Protection" option.
7. Scroll down to the "SQL Advanced Threat Protection" section.
8. Click on the "Edit" button.
9. Enable the "Monitor SQL Encryption setting" option.
10. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Once the above steps are completed, the "Monitor SQL Encryption setting is not enabled" misconfiguration will be remediated in AZURE.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Monitor SQL Encryption setting is not enabled" misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open Azure CLI and login to your Azure account using the command:
```
az login
```

Step 2: Once you are logged in, set the Azure subscription where your SQL Server is located using the command:
```
az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
```

Step 3: Check if the SQL Encryption setting is enabled or not using the command:
```
az sql server tde show --resource-group <resource_group_name> --server <sql_server_name> --database <database_name>
```

Step 4: If the SQL Encryption setting is not enabled, enable it using the command:
```
az sql server tde set --status Enabled --resource-group <resource_group_name> --server <sql_server_name> --database <database_name>
```

Step 5: Verify that the SQL Encryption setting is enabled by running the command in Step 3 again.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Monitor SQL Encryption setting is not enabled" misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Monitor SQL Encryption setting is not enabled" misconfiguration in Azure using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter
```

2. Authenticate to Azure using the `DefaultAzureCredential` class:

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
```

3. Instantiate the `SecurityCenter` client using the credential:

```python
security_center_client = SecurityCenter(
    credential=credential,
    subscription_id="<subscription_id>"
)
```

4. Get the security policy for SQL encryption:

```python
policy = security_center_client.security_policies.get(
    resource_group_name="<resource_group_name>",
    security_policy_name="<security_policy_name>"
)

sql_encryption_setting = next(
    (setting for setting in policy.settings if setting.name == "sqlEncryption"),
    None
)
```

5. If the `sqlEncryption` setting is not enabled, enable it and update the security policy:

```python
if sql_encryption_setting and not sql_encryption_setting.value:
    sql_encryption_setting.value = True
    policy = security_center_client.security_policies.create_or_update(
        resource_group_name="<resource_group_name>",
        security_policy_name="<security_policy_name>",
        security_policy=policy
    )
```

The above steps will remediate the "Monitor SQL Encryption setting is not enabled" misconfiguration in Azure using Python.
