<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Security Alert Emails Set To Subscription Owners" for Azure using Python, you can use the Azure Python SDK to programmatically configure security alerts.

Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this misconfiguration:

1. Install the Azure Python SDK by running the following command:

```
pip install azure-mgmt-monitor
```

2. Authenticate with Azure by creating a Service Principal. You can follow the instructions in this Microsoft documentation to create a Service Principal: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/azure-sdk-authenticate?tabs=cmd#create-a-service-principal

3. Once authenticated, you can use the following Python code to configure security alerts to be sent to subscription owners:

```
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import ActionGroup, EmailReceiver, ActionGroupPatchBody

# Replace the values below with your own
subscription_id = '<your-subscription-id>'
resource_group_name = '<your-resource-group-name>'
action_group_name = '<your-action-group-name>'
owner_email = '<your-owner-email>'

# Create the credentials object
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id='<your-client-id>',
    secret='<your-client-secret>',
    tenant='<your-tenant-id>'
)

# Create the MonitorManagementClient object
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)

# Create the action group
action_group = ActionGroup(
    group_short_name=action_group_name,
    receivers=[EmailReceiver(name='Owner', email_address=owner_email)],
    enabled=True
)
monitor_client.action_groups.create_or_update(resource_group_name, action_group_name, action_group)

# Update the default security alert action group to use the new action group
default_action_group = ActionGroupPatchBody(
    enabled=True,
    action_group_id=action_group.id
)
monitor_client.alert_rules.update_action_group(resource_group_name, 'default', default_action_group)
```

This code creates a new action group with an email receiver for the subscription owner's email address, and then updates the default security alert action group to use the new action group.

Make sure to replace the placeholders in the code with your own values before running it.
