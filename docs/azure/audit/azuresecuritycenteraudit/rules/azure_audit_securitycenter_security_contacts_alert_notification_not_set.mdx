### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Open Security Center: On the left-hand side menu, click on "Security Center". This will open the Azure Security Center dashboard.

3. Navigate to Security Policy: In the Security Center dashboard, click on "Security policy" on the left-hand side menu. This will open the Security Policy page.

4. Check Email Notifications: In the Security Policy page, scroll down to the "Email notifications" section. Here, you can check if the "Send email to security contact on alert" is turned off. If it is off, it means that no email notifications will be sent to the security contact when an alert is triggered.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft website and follow the installation instructions.

2. Login to Azure: After installing Azure CLI, you need to login to your Azure account. Open your command prompt and type the following command:
   ```
   az login
   ```
   This command will open a new window in your web browser asking you to sign in to your Azure account.

3. Select the Subscription: Once you are logged in, you need to select the subscription where you want to check the misconfiguration. Use the following command to list all the subscriptions:
   ```
   az account list --output table
   ```
   This command will display all the subscriptions in a table format. To select a subscription, use the following command:
   ```
   az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"
   ```

4. Check the Configuration: Now, you can check the configuration for sending email to security contact on alert. Use the following command:
   ```
   az security contact list --query "[?email].{email:email, alertNotifications:alertNotifications, alertsToAdmins:alertsToAdmins}"
   ```
   This command will list all the security contacts and their configurations. If the "alertNotifications" field is set to "Off", it means that sending email to security contact on alert is off.

#### Using Python

To check if the "Sending Email to Security Contact on Alert" is off in Azure Security Center using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Azure SDK for Python**: Azure SDK for Python is a set of libraries that allow you to manage and utilize Azure services. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-security
   ```
2. **Authenticate to Azure**: Before you can interact with Azure services, you need to authenticate. You can use Azure Identity library for this. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   security_center = SecurityCenter(credential, "<subscription_id>")
   ```
   Replace `<subscription_id>` with your Azure subscription ID.

3. **Get Security Contact Settings**: You can use the `security_contacts` client to get the security contact settings. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   security_contacts = security_center.security_contacts.list()
   for contact in security_contacts:
       print(contact)
   ```
   This will print all the security contact settings.

4. **Check if Sending Email on Alert is Off**: You can check the `alerts_to_admins` and `alerts_to_subscriptions` properties of each security contact. If they are set to `false`, it means that sending email to security contact on alert is off. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   for contact in security_contacts:
       if not contact.alerts_to_admins or not contact.alerts_to_subscriptions:
           print(f"Sending Email to Security Contact on Alert is off for {contact.id}")
   ```
   This will print the IDs of the security contacts for which sending email on alert is off.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Sending Email to Security Contact on Alert Is Off" for AZURE using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
import os
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import ActionGroup, EmailReceiver
```

2. Set the credentials and subscription ID:

```
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
```

3. Initialize the MonitorManagementClient:

```
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

4. Get the existing action groups:

```
action_groups = monitor_client.action_groups.list()
```

5. Check if the action group for sending email to security contact on alert exists, if not create it:

    action_group = ActionGroup(
        group_short_name='security-contact',
        enabled=True,
        receivers=[email_receiver],
        severity_filter='High, Critical'
    )
    monitor_client.action_groups.create_or_update(group_name='security-contact', parameters=action_group)
```

6. Enable the action group:

```
monitor_client.action_groups.enable(group_name='security-contact')
```

7. Verify that the action group is enabled:

```
action_group = monitor_client.action_groups.get(group_name='security-contact')
if action_group.enabled:
    print('Action group is enabled')
