<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of "No Security Contact Phone Set" in Azure using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using the following command:

   ```

   ```

2. Import the necessary modules and authenticate with Azure using your credentials:

   ```python
   from azure.common.credentials import UserPassCredentials
   from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient

   # Replace the values with your actual credentials
   credentials = UserPassCredentials(
       'username@your-azure-account.com',
       'your-password'
   )

   subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'

   # Create the MonitorManagementClient object
   monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(
       credentials,
       subscription_id
   )
   ```

3. Get the list of all the action groups in your Azure account:

   ```python
   action_groups = monitor_client.action_groups.list()
   ```

4. Check if any of the action groups have a phone number set:

   ```python
   for action_group in action_groups:
       if action_group.sms_receivers:
           print(f"Phone number set for {action_group.name}")
       else:
           print(f"No phone number set for {action_group.name}")
   ```

5. If you find an action group with no phone number set, update it with a valid phone number:

   ```python
   for action_group in action_groups:
       if not action_group.sms_receivers:
           action_group.sms_receivers = ["+1XXXYYYZZZZ"]  # Replace with your phone number
           monitor_client.action_groups.create_or_update(
               action_group.resource_group_name,
               action_group.name,
               action_group
           )
           print(f"Phone number set for {action_group.name}")
   ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of "No Security Contact Phone Set" in Azure using Python.
