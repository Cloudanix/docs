### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal using your Azure account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Security Center from the left-hand side menu. The Security Center is a unified security management system that strengthens the security posture of your data centers.
3. In the Security Center, go to the "Security Policy" section. Here you can manage and enforce your security policies across all your resources.
4. Check the "Contact Info" section. If the "Phone" field is empty or not set, then it indicates that no security contact phone is set in the Security Center.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft website and follow the installation instructions.

2. Login to Azure: After installing Azure CLI, you need to login to your Azure account. Open your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:
   ```
   az login
   ```
   Follow the instructions on the screen to login to your Azure account.

3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, you need to select the subscription where you want to check the security contact phone. Use the following command to set the subscription:
   ```
   az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"
   ```

4. Check Security Contact Phone: Now, you can check the security contact phone in the Security Center. Use the following command to get the security contact details:
   ```
   az security contact list --query "[].{Phone:phone}"
   ```
   This command will return the phone number set in the security contact. If it returns null or empty, it means no security contact phone is set.

#### Using Python

1. Install Azure SDK: To interact with Azure services, you need to install Azure SDK for Python. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-security
   ```
2. Import Required Libraries: Import the necessary libraries and modules in your Python script.
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter
   ```
3. Authenticate and Initialize Security Center: Use Azure Identity's DefaultAzureCredential to authenticate your script and initialize the SecurityCenter client.
   ```python
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   security_center = SecurityCenter(credential, "<subscription_id>")
   ```
4. Check for Security Contact Phone: Use the `security_contacts` method of the SecurityCenter client to get the list of security contacts. Then, iterate over the list and check if the `phone` attribute is set for each contact.
   ```python
   security_contacts = security_center.security_contacts.list()
   for contact in security_contacts:
       if not contact.phone:
           print(f"Security contact {contact.name} does not have a phone number set.")
   ```
This script will print the names of all security contacts that do not have a phone number set. Replace `<subscription_id>` with your Azure subscription ID.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "No Security Contact Phone Set" for AZURE using AZURE CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI on your local machine or using the Azure Cloud Shell.
2. Run the following command to check the current security contact phone number configuration:

   ```
   az security contact show
   ```

3. If the output shows that no phone number is set, run the following command to set the security contact phone number:

   ```
   az security contact create --email <email-address> --phone <phone-number> --name <contact-name> --alert-notifications true
   ```

   Replace the `<email-address>`, `<phone-number>`, and `<contact-name>` placeholders with the appropriate values.

4. After running the command, verify that the security contact phone number has been set by running the following command:

   ```
   az security contact show
   ```

   The output should show the updated security contact information.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the "No Security Contact Phone Set" misconfiguration for AZURE using AZURE CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of "No Security Contact Phone Set" in Azure using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using the following command:

   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-monitor
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules and authenticate with Azure using your credentials:

   ```python
   from azure.common.credentials import UserPassCredentials
   from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient

   # Replace the values with your actual credentials
   credentials = UserPassCredentials(
       'username@your-azure-account.com',
       'your-password'
   )

   subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'

   # Create the MonitorManagementClient object
   monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(
       credentials,
       subscription_id
   )
   ```

3. Get the list of all the action groups in your Azure account:

   ```python
   action_groups = monitor_client.action_groups.list()
   ```

4. Check if any of the action groups have a phone number set:

   ```python
   for action_group in action_groups:
       if action_group.sms_receivers:
           print(f"Phone number set for {action_group.name}")
       else:
           print(f"No phone number set for {action_group.name}")
   ```

5. If you find an action group with no phone number set, update it with a valid phone number:

   ```python
   for action_group in action_groups:
       if not action_group.sms_receivers:
           action_group.sms_receivers = ["+1XXXYYYZZZZ"]  # Replace with your phone number
           monitor_client.action_groups.create_or_update(
               action_group.resource_group_name,
               action_group.name,
               action_group
           )
           print(f"Phone number set for {action_group.name}")
   ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of "No Security Contact Phone Set" in Azure using Python.
