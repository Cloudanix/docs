### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to portal.azure.com and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Open Security Center: On the left-hand side menu, click on "Security Center". This will open the Security Center dashboard where you can view and manage the security posture of your resources.

3. Navigate to Security Policy: In the Security Center dashboard, click on "Security policy" on the left-hand side menu. This will open a list of your subscriptions.

4. Check Monitor System Updates setting: Click on your subscription to open the security policy settings. Scroll down to the "Compute & Apps" section and look for the "Monitor System Updates" setting. If it is not enabled, it will show as "Off".

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft website and follow the installation instructions.

2. Login to Azure: After installing Azure CLI, open your command line interface and type the following command to login to your Azure account:

   ```
   az login
   ```
   Follow the prompts in your command line interface to complete the login process.

3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, you need to select the subscription where the Security Center is located. Use the following command to list all your subscriptions:

   ```
   az account list --output table
   ```
   Then, use the following command to set your desired subscription:

   ```
   az account set --subscription "mySubscription"
   ```

4. Check Monitor System Updates setting: Now, you can check if the Monitor System Updates setting is enabled in Security Center. Use the following command:

   ```
   az security auto-provisioning-setting list
   ```
   This command will list all the auto-provisioning settings in Security Center. Look for the "Monitor System Updates" setting in the output. If it's not listed, it means the setting is not enabled.

#### Using Python

To check if the Monitor System Updates setting is not enabled in Azure Security Center using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Azure SDK for Python**: Azure SDK for Python is a set of libraries that allow you to manage your Azure resources. To install it, you can use pip:
   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-security
   ```
2. **Authenticate to Azure**: Before you can interact with Azure resources, you need to authenticate. You can use Azure Identity library for this. Here is an example of how to authenticate using a service principal:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import ClientSecretCredential
   from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter

   tenant_id = "your-tenant-id"
   client_id = "your-client-id"
   client_secret = "your-client-secret"

   credential = ClientSecretCredential(tenant_id, client_id, client_secret)
   client = SecurityCenter(credential, "your-subscription-id")
   ```
3. **Get the Security Center Policy**: You can get the Security Center policy for your subscription using the `security_center_policies` client. This will return a policy object that contains all the settings for your Security Center.
   ```python
   policy = client.security_center_policies.get("default")
   ```
4. **Check the Monitor System Updates Setting**: The policy object contains a property `monitorSystemUpdates` that indicates whether the Monitor System Updates setting is enabled. You can check this property to see if it is not enabled.
   ```python
   if not policy.data.monitorSystemUpdates:
       print("Monitor System Updates setting is not enabled.")
   else:
       print("Monitor System Updates setting is enabled.")
   ```
Please replace `"your-tenant-id"`, `"your-client-id"`, `"your-client-secret"`, and `"your-subscription-id"` with your actual Azure tenant ID, client ID, client secret, and subscription ID.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Monitor System Updates setting is not enabled" misconfiguration in Azure using the Azure console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the virtual machine that needs to be remediated.
3. Click on the "Security" tab in the left-hand menu.
4. Click on the "Security Center" link.
5. This will open the Azure Security Center. Click on the "Recommendations" tab.
6. Find the recommendation "Enable monitoring of system updates on virtual machines" and click on it.
7. This will open the recommendation details page. Click on the "Remediate" button.
8. In the "Remediate recommendation" window, select the virtual machine that needs to be remediated and click on the "Remediate" button.
9. Wait for the remediation to complete. This may take several minutes.
10. Once the remediation is complete, refresh the page to ensure that the "Monitor System Updates" setting is now enabled.

Following these steps will remediate the "Monitor System Updates setting is not enabled" misconfiguration in Azure using the Azure console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Monitor System Updates setting is not enabled" misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI, follow the steps below:

1. Open the Azure CLI on your local machine or in the Azure Portal.

2. Run the following command to check the current status of the "Monitor System Updates" setting:

   ```
   az vm get-instance-view --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <vm-name> --query "instanceView.extensions[?type=='Microsoft.Azure.Security.AzureSecurityCenter'].settings"
   ```

   Replace `<resource-group-name>` and `<vm-name>` with the name of the resource group and virtual machine that you want to check.

3. If the "Monitor System Updates" setting is not enabled, run the following command to enable it:

   ```
   az vm extension set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --vm-name <vm-name> --name AzureSecurityCenter --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Security --settings "{'monitorWindowsUpdates': true, 'monitorLinuxUpdates': true}"
   ```

   Replace `<resource-group-name>` and `<vm-name>` with the name of the resource group and virtual machine that you want to remediate.

4. Once the command is executed successfully, the "Monitor System Updates" setting will be enabled for the virtual machine.

Note: The Azure Security Center must be enabled for the subscription and the virtual machine for this remediation to work.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Monitor System Updates setting is not enabled" misconfiguration in Azure using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the step by step instructions:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using the following command:

   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-monitor
   ```

2. Authenticate with Azure using your Azure credentials. You can use the following code to authenticate:

   ```
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
   from azure.mgmt.resource import SubscriptionClient
   
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   subscription_client = SubscriptionClient(credential)
   subscription = next(subscription_client.subscriptions.list())
   monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription.subscription_id)
   ```

3. Get the current configuration for the Monitor System Updates setting using the following code:

   ```
   settings = monitor_client.diagnostic_settings.list(resource_uri='/', metric_namespace='Microsoft.Insights', metric_name='Heartbeat')
   for setting in settings:
       if setting.workspace_id:
           print(f"Workspace ID: {setting.workspace_id}")
           print(f"Log Analytics Solution Enabled: {setting.enabled}")
   ```

4. If the "Log Analytics Solution Enabled" value is False, then the Monitor System Updates setting is not enabled. To remediate this, you can enable the setting using the following code:

   ```
   from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import LogAnalyticsDestinationDetails, DiagnosticSettingsCategoryResource
   
   workspace_id = "<your workspace ID>"
   log_analytics_destination = LogAnalyticsDestinationDetails(workspace_id=workspace_id)
   category = DiagnosticSettingsCategoryResource(enabled=True, name='Heartbeat', destinations=[log_analytics_destination])
   monitor_client.diagnostic_settings.create_or_update(resource_uri='/', settings_name='Heartbeat', parameters={'categories': [category]})
   ```

   Replace `<your workspace ID>` with the ID of your Log Analytics workspace.

5. After running the remediation code, you can verify that the setting is enabled by running the code in step 3 again and checking that the "Log Analytics Solution Enabled" value is True.
