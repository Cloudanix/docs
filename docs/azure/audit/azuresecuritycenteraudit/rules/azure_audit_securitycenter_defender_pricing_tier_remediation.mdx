<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To enable Microsoft Defender Standard Pricing Tier in Azure using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using the following command:

   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-resource
   ```

2. Authenticate using the Azure CLI or a service principal. You can use the following code to authenticate using a service principal:

   ```
   from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

   # Replace the values with your own
   subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
   client_id = 'your-client-id'
   secret = 'your-client-secret'
   tenant = 'your-tenant-id'

   credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
       client_id=client_id,
       secret=secret,
       tenant=tenant
   )
   ```

3. Create a `ResourceManagementClient` object using the authenticated credentials and the subscription ID:

   ```
   from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
   from azure.mgmt.resource.resources.models import GenericResource

   resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
   ```

4. Get the resource group and the Microsoft Defender Security Center workspace. You can use the following code to get the resource group and workspace:

   ```
   resource_group_name = 'your-resource-group-name'
   workspace_name = 'your-workspace-name'

   workspace_resource = resource_client.resources.get(
       resource_group_name,
       'Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces',
       workspace_name
   )
   ```

5. Update the pricing tier for the workspace to `PerNode`. You can use the following code to update the pricing tier:

   ```
   workspace_resource.properties['sku'] = {
       'name': 'PerNode',
       'tier': 'Standard'
   }

   resource_client.resources.create_or_update(
       resource_group_name,
       'Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces',
       workspace_name,
       GenericResource(location=workspace_resource.location, properties=workspace_resource.properties)
   )
   ```

6. Verify that the pricing tier has been updated by checking the workspace properties:

   ```
   workspace = resource_client.resources.get(
       resource_group_name,
       'Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces',
       workspace_name
   )

   print(workspace.properties['sku'])
   ```

This should enable Microsoft Defender Standard Pricing Tier in Azure for the specified workspace.
