#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal by entering "https://portal.azure.com" in your web browser. Enter your Azure account credentials to log in.

2. Open Azure Security Center: Once you are logged in, look for the "Security Center" option in the left-hand side menu. Click on it to open the Azure Security Center dashboard.

3. Navigate to the Security Policy: In the Security Center dashboard, look for the "Security policy" option in the left-hand side menu. Click on it to open the Security Policy page.

4. Check the Total Number of Subscription Owners: In the Security Policy page, you will find a section named "Total number of subscription owners". This section will display the total number of owners for each subscription. Monitor this number regularly to detect any misconfigurations.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft website and follow the installation instructions. 

2. Login to Azure: After installing Azure CLI, you need to login to your Azure account. Open your command prompt and type the following command:
   ```
   az login
   ```
   This command will open a new window in your web browser asking you to sign in to your Azure account. 

3. Select the Subscription: Once you are logged in, you need to select the subscription you want to monitor. You can do this by typing the following command:
   ```
   az account set --subscription "mySubscription"
   ```
   Replace "mySubscription" with the name of your subscription.

4. Monitor the Total Number of Subscription Owners: Now you can monitor the total number of subscription owners in Security Center. Use the following command:
   ```
   az security regulatory-compliance-controls list --name "Monitor the total number of subscription owners"
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the subscription owners in Security Center. You can count the number of owners by looking at the length of the returned list.

#### Using Python

1. **Setup Azure SDK for Python**: First, you need to install the Azure SDK for Python on your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-security
   ```
   This will install the Azure Management Security client library for Python which allows you to interact with the Azure Security Center.

2. **Authenticate with Azure**: Before you can interact with Azure, you need to authenticate. You can do this by setting up a service principal and assigning it the necessary permissions. Here is a sample code snippet to authenticate:
   ```python
   from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

   subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
   credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
       client_id='your-app-id',
       secret='your-app-secret',
       tenant='your-tenant-id'
   )
   ```
   Replace 'your-subscription-id', 'your-app-id', 'your-app-secret', and 'your-tenant-id' with your actual Azure subscription ID, app ID, app secret, and tenant ID respectively.

3. **Initialize Security Center Client**: After authenticating, you can initialize the Security Center client. Here is a sample code snippet to do this:
   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter

   sc = SecurityCenter(credentials, subscription_id)
   ```

4. **Monitor the Total Number of Subscription Owners**: Now, you can use the Security Center client to monitor the total number of subscription owners. Here is a sample code snippet to do this:
   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.security.models import SecurityContact

   contacts = sc.security_contacts.list()
   owners = [contact for contact in contacts if contact.type == SecurityContact.type.owner]
   print(f'Total number of subscription owners: {len(owners)}')
   ```
   This script will print the total number of subscription owners in the Security Center.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure! Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration of monitoring the total number of subscription owners in Azure:

1. Open the Azure portal and log in with your credentials.
2. Navigate to the Azure Active Directory service.
3. Click on the "Enterprise applications" option from the left-hand side menu.
4. In the search bar, type "Azure AD Privileged Identity Management" and select it from the search results.
5. Click on the "Manage" button to open the Azure AD Privileged Identity Management console.
6. From the left-hand side menu, select "Roles and administrators".
7. In the "Roles and administrators" page, select "Add" to add a new role assignment.
8. In the "Add assignment" page, select "Owner" from the "Directory roles" dropdown list.
9. In the "Select" page, select the user or group that you want to assign the "Owner" role to.
10. Click on the "Assign" button to complete the role assignment.
11. Repeat steps 7-10 for all the users or groups that need to be assigned the "Owner" role.
12. Once all the users or groups are assigned the "Owner" role, go back to the Azure AD Privileged Identity Management console and select "Settings" from the left-hand side menu.
13. In the "Settings" page, select "Notifications".
14. In the "Notifications" page, select "Add notification".
15. In the "Add notification" page, configure the notification settings as per your requirements.
16. Click on the "Save" button to save the notification settings.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration of monitoring the total number of subscription owners in Azure using the Azure console.

#### Using CLI

The misconfiguration "Monitor the Total Number of Subscription Owners" can be remediated in Azure using the following steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.

2. Login to Azure using the Azure CLI command: 

   ```
   az login
   ```

3. Select the subscription that you want to monitor using the following command:

   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
   ```

4. Retrieve the number of subscription owners using the following command:

   ```
   az role assignment list --role Owner --query "[].principalName" --output tsv | sort | uniq | wc -l
   ```

   This command retrieves all the role assignments with the "Owner" role, filters out the principal names, sorts and counts the unique principal names.

5. Set up a notification to alert you when the number of subscription owners changes. You can use Azure Monitor to create an alert rule that sends an email or SMS notification when the number of subscription owners exceeds a certain threshold.

   ```
   az monitor metrics alert create -n "<alert-name>" --description "<alert-description>" --condition "total subscription owners > <threshold>" --resource-type "Microsoft.Subscription" --resource "<subscription-id>" --window-size 5m --evaluation-frequency 1m --severity 3 --action email <email-address>
   ```

   Replace `<alert-name>` and `<alert-description>` with a name and description for your alert, `<threshold>` with the number of subscription owners that triggers the alert, `<subscription-id>` with the ID of your subscription, and `<email-address>` with the email address to which notifications should be sent.

   This command creates an alert rule that monitors the "total subscription owners" metric for your subscription, evaluates it every minute, and sends an email notification if the threshold is exceeded.

6. Verify that the alert is working by adding or removing subscription owners and checking that you receive notifications when the threshold is exceeded.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Monitor the Total Number of Subscription Owners" in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To monitor the total number of subscription owners in Azure, you can use the Azure Management API. Here are the steps to remediate this issue using Python:

Step 1: Install the Azure SDK for Python

You can install the Azure SDK for Python using pip. Open the terminal and run the following command:

```python
pip install azure-mgmt-resource
```

Step 2: Authenticate with Azure

To authenticate with Azure, you need to create a service principal. You can create a service principal using the Azure CLI or the Azure portal. Once you have the service principal details, you can use them to authenticate with Azure. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

TENANT_ID = '<your tenant id>'
CLIENT_ID = '<your client id>'
CLIENT_SECRET = '<your client secret>'

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=CLIENT_ID,
    secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
    tenant=TENANT_ID
)
```

Step 3: Get the Subscription Owners

Once you're authenticated with Azure, you can use the Azure Management API to get the subscription owners. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient

subscription_id = '<your subscription id>'

resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)

owners = resource_client.providers.get('Microsoft.Authorization').get('resourceGroups', 'providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments').properties.permissions[0].actions[0].notActions[0].dataActions[0].notDataActions[0].principalIds

total_owners = len(owners)
```

This code snippet gets the subscription owners by querying the Azure Management API. The `ResourceManagementClient` is used to interact with the Azure Resource Manager API. The `providers.get` method is used to get the role assignments for the Microsoft.Authorization provider. The `properties.permissions` attribute contains the list of permissions for the provider. The `actions` attribute contains the list of actions that can be performed on the resource. The `notActions` attribute contains the list of actions that cannot be performed on the resource. The `dataActions` attribute contains the list of data actions that can be performed on the resource. The `notDataActions` attribute contains the list of data actions that cannot be performed on the resource. Finally, the `principalIds` attribute contains the list of principal IDs for the role assignment.

Step 4: Remediate the Issue

To remediate the issue, you need to ensure that there are no more than two subscription owners. If there are more than two subscription owners, you can remove the excess owners. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
if total_owners > 2:
    excess_owners = total_owners - 2
    print(f'Total number of subscription owners: {total_owners}. Excess owners: {excess_owners}.')
    # Code to remove excess owners
else:
    print(f'Total number of subscription owners: {total_owners}.')
```

This code snippet checks if there are more than two subscription owners. If there are, it calculates the number of excess owners and prints a message indicating the total number of subscription owners and the number of excess owners. You can replace the comment with the code to remove the excess owners.
