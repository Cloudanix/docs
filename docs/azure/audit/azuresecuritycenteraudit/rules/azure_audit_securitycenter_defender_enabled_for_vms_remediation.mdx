### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal using your Azure account credentials.

2. Navigate to the "Security Center" from the left-hand side menu. In the Security Center dashboard, you will find a section named "Cloud Security".

3. In the Cloud Security section, click on "Security policy". This will open a new page where you can see all the subscriptions associated with your Azure account.

4. Click on the specific subscription for which you want to check the Microsoft Defender for Cloud status. In the "Settings" section, look for "Microsoft Defender plans". Click on it and you will see the status of Microsoft Defender for Cloud for Virtual Machines. If it's enabled, it will show "On", otherwise, it will show "Off".

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft website and follow the installation instructions.

2. Login to Azure: After installing Azure CLI, you need to login to your Azure account. Open your command line interface and type the following command:

   ```
   az login
   ```
   Follow the instructions to login to your Azure account.

3. Check the status of Microsoft Defender for Cloud: To check the status of Microsoft Defender for Cloud for your virtual machines, you can use the following command:

   ```
   az security pricing list
   ```
   This command will list all the resources and their associated security pricing tiers. Look for the 'virtualMachines' resource type and check its 'pricingTier' value. If the value is 'Standard', then Microsoft Defender for Cloud is enabled for your virtual machines.

4. Check the status of Microsoft Defender for Cloud for a specific virtual machine: If you want to check the status of Microsoft Defender for Cloud for a specific virtual machine, you can use the following command:

   ```
   az vm show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --query securityProfile
   ```
   Replace 'myResourceGroup' and 'myVM' with the name of your resource group and virtual machine respectively. This command will show the security profile of the specified virtual machine. If the 'securityProfile' value is 'Standard', then Microsoft Defender for Cloud is enabled for this virtual machine.

#### Using Python

To check if Microsoft Defender for Cloud is enabled for Virtual Machines in Azure Security Center using Python scripts, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Azure SDK for Python**: You need to install the Azure SDK for Python in your environment. You can do this using pip:
   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-security
   ```
2. **Authenticate to Azure**: Before you can interact with Azure resources, you need to authenticate. You can use Azure Identity library for this. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   security_center = SecurityCenter(credential, "<subscription_id>")
   ```
   Replace `<subscription_id>` with your Azure subscription ID.

3. **Get the Security Settings**: Now, you can get the security settings of your subscription. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   security_settings = security_center.settings.get(setting_name="MCAS")
   print(security_settings)
   ```
   This will print the settings of Microsoft Defender for Cloud (formerly known as Microsoft Cloud App Security or MCAS).

4. **Check if Defender for Cloud is Enabled**: Now, you can check if Defender for Cloud is enabled for Virtual Machines. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   if security_settings.data["enabled"]:
       print("Microsoft Defender for Cloud is enabled for Virtual Machines.")
   else:
       print("Microsoft Defender for Cloud is not enabled for Virtual Machines.")
   ```
   This will print whether Microsoft Defender for Cloud is enabled for Virtual Machines or not.

Please note that you need appropriate permissions to read the security settings. Also, the actual setting name and data structure may vary, so you need to adjust the code accordingly.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for Virtual Machines" for Azure using Azure console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Select the Virtual Machine on which you want to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud
3. Under the "Settings" section, select "Security + Compliance"
4. Click on "Security Center" to open the Security Center blade
5. On the Security Center blade, click on "Recommendations"
6. Look for the recommendation "Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for Virtual Machines" and click on it
7. Click on the "Remediate" button to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for the selected Virtual Machine
8. Once the remediation is complete, verify that Microsoft Defender for Cloud is enabled for the Virtual Machine by going to the "Security + Compliance" section and checking the status of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

Note: It is recommended to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for all Virtual Machines in the Azure environment to ensure comprehensive security coverage.

#### Using CLI

To enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for Virtual Machines in Azure, follow the below steps using Azure CLI:

1. Open the Azure CLI and login to your Azure account using the command: 

   ```
   az login
   ```

2. Once you are logged in, set the subscription to the one you want to work with using the command:

   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
   ```

3. Next, enable the Microsoft Defender for Cloud for Virtual Machines using the command:

   ```
   az security vm enable-defense --name <virtual_machine_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name>
   ```

   Replace `<virtual_machine_name>` with the name of the virtual machine you want to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud and `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group where the virtual machine is located.

4. Wait for a few minutes for the changes to take effect. Once the changes are applied, you can verify the status of Microsoft Defender for Cloud for Virtual Machines using the command:

   ```
   az security vm show --name <virtual_machine_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --query 'defenderStatus.status'
   ```

   This command will return the status of Microsoft Defender for Cloud for Virtual Machines for the specified virtual machine.

That's it! You have successfully enabled Microsoft Defender for Cloud for Virtual Machines in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for Virtual Machines in Azure using Python, follow these steps:
