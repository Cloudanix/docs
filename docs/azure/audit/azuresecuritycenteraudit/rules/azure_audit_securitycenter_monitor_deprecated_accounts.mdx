### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to portal.azure.com and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Open Security Center: On the left-hand side menu, click on "Security Center". This will open the main dashboard of Azure Security Center.

3. Check Security Policy: In the Security Center, click on "Security policy" on the left-hand side menu. This will open a list of your subscription directories. Click on the subscription you want to check.

4. Check for Deprecated Accounts Monitoring: In the security policy settings, look for the setting "Monitor deprecated accounts". If it is enabled, it will show "On". If it is not, it will show "Off". This setting indicates whether Azure is actively monitoring for the use of deprecated accounts, which can be a security risk.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft website and follow the installation instructions.

2. Login to Azure: After installing Azure CLI, open your command prompt or terminal and type the following command to login to your Azure account:

   ```
   az login
   ```
   Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the login process.

3. Check Azure Policy Definitions: To check if the monitoring of deprecated accounts is enabled, you need to check the Azure Policy definitions. Use the following command to list all the policy definitions:

   ```
   az policy definition list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all policy definitions. Look for the policy definition with the name "Monitor deprecated accounts".

4. Check Policy Assignment: If the policy definition is present, you need to check if it is assigned to your resources. Use the following command to list all policy assignments:

   ```
   az policy assignment list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all policy assignments. Look for the policy assignment with the policy definition name "Monitor deprecated accounts". If it is present, then the monitoring of deprecated accounts is enabled. If it is not present, then it is not enabled.

#### Using Python

To check if monitoring of deprecated accounts is enabled in Azure Security Center using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Azure SDK for Python**: Azure SDK for Python is a set of libraries that allow you to manage and utilize Azure services. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-security
   ```
2. **Authenticate to Azure**: Before you can interact with Azure services, you need to authenticate. You can use Azure Identity library for Python to authenticate. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   security_center = SecurityCenter(credential, "<subscription_id>")
   ```
   Replace `<subscription_id>` with your Azure subscription ID.

3. **Get Security Settings**: Use the `security_settings` property of the `SecurityCenter` client to get the security settings. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   security_settings = security_center.security_settings.get()
   ```
4. **Check if Monitoring of Deprecated Accounts is Enabled**: The `security_settings` object contains a property `is_deprecated_accounts_enabled` which indicates if monitoring of deprecated accounts is enabled. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   if security_settings.is_deprecated_accounts_enabled:
       print("Monitoring of Deprecated Accounts is enabled.")
   else:
       print("Monitoring of Deprecated Accounts is not enabled.")
   ```
Please note that the actual property names and methods might be different depending on the version of Azure SDK for Python you are using. Always refer to the official documentation for the most accurate information.

7. Once enabled, click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

8. Verify that the policy is now enabled by checking the "Policy Status" column for the "Monitoring of deprecated accounts" policy. It should show "Compliant".

By following these steps, you will have successfully remediated the "Enable Monitoring of Deprecated Accounts" misconfiguration for AZURE using the AZURE console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Enable Monitoring of Deprecated Accounts" for Azure using Azure CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open Azure CLI and login to your Azure account using the command:

   `az login`

2. Once you are logged in, you need to select the subscription for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration using the command:

   `az account set --subscription <subscription-id>`

   Replace `<subscription-id>` with the ID of the subscription you want to select.

3. After selecting the subscription, you need to enable the monitoring of deprecated accounts by creating an activity log alert. To do this, run the following command:

   `az monitor activity-log alert create --name <alert-name> --description <alert-description> --condition category=ServiceHealth severity=warning --action email <email-address>`

   Replace `<alert-name>` with the name of the alert you want to create, `<alert-description>` with the description of the alert, and `<email-address>` with the email address where you want to receive the alert notifications.

4. Once the activity log alert is created, you need to enable it using the command:

   `az monitor activity-log alert update --name <alert-name> --enable true`

   Replace `<alert-name>` with the name of the alert you created in step 3.

5. Finally, you can verify that the activity log alert is enabled by running the following command:

   `az monitor activity-log alert show --name <alert-name>`

   Replace `<alert-name>` with the name of the alert you created in step 3.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Enable Monitoring of Deprecated Accounts" for Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Enable Monitoring of Deprecated Accounts" for AZURE using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import ActionGroup, ActionGroupPatchBody, ActionGroupResource
```

2. Set the credentials to access the Azure account:

```
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
```

3. Instantiate the `MonitorManagementClient` object:

```
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

4. Get the list of action groups:

```
action_groups = monitor_client.action_groups.list()
```

5. Check if there is an action group named "Deprecated Accounts" in the list. If it does not exist, create it:

```
action_group_name = "Deprecated Accounts"
action_group_exists = False

for ag in action_groups:
    if ag.name == action_group_name:
        action_group_exists = True
        break

if not action_group_exists:
    email_address = "your_email_address@example.com"
    sms_recipient = "+1234567890"
    webhook_url = "https://your_webhook_url.com"

    action_group = ActionGroupResource(
        enabled=True,
        name=action_group_name,
        short_name=action_group_name,
        email_receivers=[email_address],
        sms_receivers=[sms_recipient],
        webhook_receivers=[webhook_url]
    )

    monitor_client.action_groups.create_or_update(resource_group_name, action_group_name, action_group)
```

6. Once the action group is created, you can set up the alert rule to monitor the deprecated accounts:

```
alert_rule_name = "Deprecated Accounts Alert Rule"
alert_rule_exists = False

for rule in monitor_client.alert_rules.list_by_resource_group(resource_group_name):
    if rule.name == alert_rule_name:
        alert_rule_exists = True
        break

if not alert_rule_exists:
    criteria = {
        "odata.type": "Microsoft.Azure.Monitor.Query.Models.NumericThresholdCriteria",
        "dataSourceId": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Insights/metrics",
        "metricName": "DeprecatedAccounts",
        "operator": "GreaterThan",
        "threshold": 0,
        "timeAggregation": "Average",
        "dimensions": [
            {
                "name": "ResourceId",
                "value": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}"
            }
        ],
        "metricNamespace": "Microsoft.Authorization"
    }

    action_group_ids = [ag.id for ag in monitor_client.action_groups.list()]
    alert_rule = {
        "name": alert_rule_name,
        "description": "Alert rule to monitor deprecated accounts.",
        "isEnabled": True,
        "condition": {
            "odata.type": "Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.ThresholdRuleCondition",
            "dataSource": {
                "odata.type": "Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.RuleMetricDataSource",
                "resourceUri": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}",
                "metricNamespace": "Microsoft.Authorization",
                "metricName": "DeprecatedAccounts",
                "aggregation": {
                    "odata.type": "Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.RuleMetricDataSourceAggregation",
                    "metricName": "DeprecatedAccounts",
                    "function": "Average"
                }
            },
            "operator": {
                "odata.type": "Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.ThresholdOperator",
                "name": "GreaterThan"
            },
            "threshold": 0,
            "windowSize": "PT5M"
        },
        "actions": [
            {
                "odata.type": "Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.RuleEmailAction",
                "sendToServiceOwners": False,
                "customEmails": []
            },
            {
                "odata.type": "Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.RuleActionGroup",
                "actionGroupId": action_group_ids[0]
            }
        ]
    }

    monitor_client.alert_rules.create_or_update(resource_group_name, alert_rule_name, alert_rule)
```

7. Finally, you can verify that the alert rule is set up correctly by checking the Azure portal or by running the following command:

```
alert_rules = monitor_client.alert_rules.list_by_resource_group(resource_group_name)

for rule in alert_rules:
    if rule.name == alert_rule_name:
        print("Alert rule {} is enabled.".format(alert_rule_name))
        break
```

These steps will enable monitoring of deprecated accounts in Azure and send alerts to the specified action group when any deprecated accounts are detected.
