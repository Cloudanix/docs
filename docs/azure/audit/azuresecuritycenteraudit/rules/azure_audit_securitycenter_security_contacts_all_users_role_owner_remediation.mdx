### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal by entering "https://portal.azure.com" in your web browser's address bar. Enter your Azure account credentials to log in.

2. Open Security Center: Once you're logged in, locate the "Security Center" option in the left-hand menu. Click on it to open the Security Center dashboard.

3. Navigate to Security Policy: In the Security Center dashboard, find and click on the "Security policy" option. This will open a new page where you can view and manage your security policies.

4. Check Email Notifications: In the Security Policy page, look for the "Email notifications" section. Here, you can check if security alert emails are set to be sent to subscription owners. If the option is enabled, it means that subscription owners will receive email notifications for security alerts. If it's not, then this is a misconfiguration that needs to be addressed.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal and type `az --version` to confirm that it's installed correctly.

2. Login to Azure: Use the `az login` command to log in to your Azure account. You'll be redirected to the browser to enter your credentials. Once you've successfully logged in, you'll see a JSON output in your terminal showing your subscriptions.

3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, you need to select the one you want to check. Use the `az account set --subscription "my-subscription-name"` command to set the active subscription.

4. Check Security Alert Emails: Use the `az security setting list` command to list all the settings in Azure Security Center. Look for the "securityAlerts" setting. If the "sendToAdmins" property is set to true, then security alert emails are set to subscription owners. If not, then it's a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. Install Azure SDK: To interact with Azure resources, you need to install Azure SDK in your Python environment. You can do this by running the command `pip install azure-mgmt-security`.

2. Import Required Libraries: Import the necessary libraries into your Python script. You will need the `azure.identity` and `azure.mgmt.security` libraries.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter
```

3. Authenticate and Initialize Security Center: Use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to authenticate your script with Azure. Then, initialize the `SecurityCenter` client.

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
security_center = SecurityCenter(credential, "<subscription_id>")
```

4. Check Security Alert Emails: Use the `security_center.settings.get()` method to retrieve the settings for the Security Center. Check the `contact` property of the returned settings object to see if the security alert emails are set to the subscription owners.

```python
settings = security_center.settings.get(setting_name="MCAS")
if settings.contact.emails:
    print("Security alert emails are set to: ", settings.contact.emails)
else:
    print("Security alert emails are not set.")
```

This script will print out the emails to which security alerts are sent. If the emails match the subscription owners' emails, then the configuration is correct. If not, there is a misconfiguration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Security Alert Emails Set To Subscription Owners" in Azure using the Azure console, follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the Security Center by clicking on the "Security Center" icon in the left-hand menu.
3. In the Security Center, click on the "Security policy" tab in the left-hand menu.
4. In the Security policy tab, click on the "Edit" button to edit the security policy.
5. Scroll down to the "Email notification settings" section and ensure that the "Send email notifications to subscription owners" option is enabled.
6. If the option is not enabled, click on the toggle switch to enable it.
7. Once enabled, click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

After completing the above steps, the misconfiguration "Ensure Security Alert Emails Set To Subscription Owners" will be remediated in Azure. Azure will now send email notifications to the subscription owners for any security alerts.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Security Alert Emails Set To Subscription Owners" for Azure using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI command prompt.

2. Run the following command to set the security alert email to the subscription owner:

   ```
   az monitor activity-log alert update --name {alert_name} --resource-group {resource_group_name} --condition-category "Security" --email-service-owners true --enabled true
   ```

   Replace `{alert_name}` with the name of the security alert that you want to update, and `{resource_group_name}` with the name of the resource group that contains the alert.

3. Verify that the security alert email has been set to the subscription owner by running the following command:

   ```
   az monitor activity-log alert show --name {alert_name} --resource-group {resource_group_name}
   ```

   This command will display the details of the security alert, including the email settings.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Security Alert Emails Set To Subscription Owners" for Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Security Alert Emails Set To Subscription Owners" for Azure using Python, you can use the Azure Python SDK to programmatically configure security alerts.

Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this misconfiguration:

1. Install the Azure Python SDK by running the following command:

```
pip install azure-mgmt-monitor
```

2. Authenticate with Azure by creating a Service Principal. You can follow the instructions in this Microsoft documentation to create a Service Principal: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/azure-sdk-authenticate?tabs=cmd#create-a-service-principal

3. Once authenticated, you can use the following Python code to configure security alerts to be sent to subscription owners:

```
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.monitor.models import ActionGroup, EmailReceiver, ActionGroupPatchBody

# Replace the values below with your own
subscription_id = '<your-subscription-id>'
resource_group_name = '<your-resource-group-name>'
action_group_name = '<your-action-group-name>'
owner_email = '<your-owner-email>'

# Create the credentials object
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id='<your-client-id>',
    secret='<your-client-secret>',
    tenant='<your-tenant-id>'
)

# Create the MonitorManagementClient object
monitor_client = MonitorManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)

# Create the action group
action_group = ActionGroup(
    group_short_name=action_group_name,
    receivers=[EmailReceiver(name='Owner', email_address=owner_email)],
    enabled=True
)
monitor_client.action_groups.create_or_update(resource_group_name, action_group_name, action_group)

# Update the default security alert action group to use the new action group
default_action_group = ActionGroupPatchBody(
    enabled=True,
    action_group_id=action_group.id
)
monitor_client.alert_rules.update_action_group(resource_group_name, 'default', default_action_group)
```

This code creates a new action group with an email receiver for the subscription owner's email address, and then updates the default security alert action group to use the new action group.

Make sure to replace the placeholders in the code with your own values before running it.
