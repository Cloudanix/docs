### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal by entering "https://portal.azure.com" in your web browser's address bar. Enter your Azure account credentials to log in.

2. Open Security Center: Once you're logged in, look for the "Security Center" option in the left-hand menu. Click on it to open the Security Center dashboard.

3. Navigate to SQL Servers: In the Security Center dashboard, look for the "SQL Servers" option under the "Resource security hygiene" section. Click on it to view the list of your SQL servers.

4. Check Auditing Settings: For each SQL server, check the "Auditing" column. If the status is "Off", it means that the Monitor SQL Auditing setting is not enabled. If it's "On", it means that the setting is enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI commands, you need to have it installed on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft website and follow the installation instructions.

2. Login to Azure: Open your command line interface and type the following command to login to your Azure account:
   ```
   az login
   ```
   Follow the prompts in your browser to complete the authentication process.

3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, you need to select the subscription where you want to check the SQL Auditing setting. Use the following command to list all your subscriptions:
   ```
   az account list --output table
   ```
   Then, use the following command to set your desired subscription:
   ```
   az account set --subscription "My Subscription"
   ```

4. Check SQL Auditing Setting: Now, you can check the SQL Auditing setting using the following command:
   ```
   az security sql-server-auditing-settings list --query "[?properties.state=='Disabled']"
   ```
   This command will list all the SQL servers where the auditing setting is disabled. If the list is empty, it means that the SQL Auditing setting is enabled on all servers.

#### Using Python

To check if the Monitor SQL Auditing setting is not enabled in Azure Security Center using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Azure SDK for Python**: Azure SDK for Python is a set of libraries that allow you to manage and utilize Azure services. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-security
   ```
2. **Authenticate to Azure**: Before you can interact with Azure services, you need to authenticate. You can use Azure Identity library for this. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   client = SecurityCenter(credential, "<subscription_id>")
   ```
   Replace `<subscription_id>` with your Azure subscription ID.

3. **Fetch SQL Auditing Settings**: Now, you can fetch the SQL Auditing settings using the `client.sql_server_blob_auditing_policies` object. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.security.models import SQLServerBlobAuditingPolicy

   def get_sql_auditing_settings(subscription_id, resource_group, server_name):
       auditing_settings = client.sql_server_blob_auditing_policies.get(
           resource_group_name=resource_group,
           server_name=server_name,
           blob_auditing_policy_name=SQLServerBlobAuditingPolicy.DEFAULT_NAME
       )
       return auditing_settings
   ```
   Replace `subscription_id`, `resource_group`, and `server_name` with your Azure subscription ID, resource group name, and SQL server name respectively.

4. **Check if SQL Auditing is Enabled**: Finally, you can check if SQL Auditing is enabled by checking the `state` property of the auditing settings. Here is a sample code snippet:
   ```python
   def is_sql_auditing_enabled(auditing_settings):
       return auditing_settings.state == "Enabled"

   auditing_settings = get_sql_auditing_settings("<subscription_id>", "<resource_group>", "<server_name>")
   print("SQL Auditing is enabled: ", is_sql_auditing_enabled(auditing_settings))
   ```
   Replace `<subscription_id>`, `<resource_group>`, and `<server_name>` with your Azure subscription ID, resource group name, and SQL server name respectively. This script will print `True` if SQL Auditing is enabled and `False` otherwise.

1. Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to the SQL Server that you want to remediate.

2. Click on "Auditing" under the "Security" section in the left-hand menu.

3. Click on "Enable Auditing" at the top of the page.

4. In the "Auditing settings" section, select the database(s) that you want to audit.

5. Choose the events that you want to audit by selecting the appropriate checkboxes.

6. Choose the storage account where you want to store the audit logs.

7. Click on "Save" to enable auditing.

8. Once auditing is enabled, you can view the audit logs by clicking on "Audit logs" under the "Security" section in the left-hand menu.

9. Verify that the audit logs are being generated properly.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Monitor SQL Auditing setting is not enabled" misconfiguration in Azure using the Azure console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Monitor SQL Auditing setting is not enabled" misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI on your local machine or use the Azure Cloud Shell.

2. Connect to your Azure account using the following command:
```
az login
```

3. Once you are logged in, select the Azure subscription where the SQL Server resides:
```
az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
```

4. Enable the SQL Auditing setting using the following command:
```
az sql server audit-policy update --state Enabled --storage-account <storage_account_name> --storage-key <storage_account_key> --storage-endpoint <storage_account_endpoint> --retention-days <number_of_days> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --server <sql_server_name>
```

Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values:
- `<storage_account_name>`: The name of the storage account where the audit logs will be stored.
- `<storage_account_key>`: The access key for the storage account.
- `<storage_account_endpoint>`: The endpoint for the storage account.
- `<number_of_days>`: The number of days to retain the audit logs.
- `<resource_group_name>`: The name of the resource group where the SQL Server resides.
- `<sql_server_name>`: The name of the SQL Server.

5. Verify that the SQL Auditing setting is enabled by running the following command:
```
az sql server audit-policy show --resource-group <resource_group_name> --server <sql_server_name>

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Monitor SQL Auditing setting is not enabled" misconfiguration for Azure using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using pip:

```
pip install azure-mgmt-sql
```

2. Import the necessary modules:

```
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
```

3. Set up the credentials to authenticate to Azure:

```
subscription_id = '<your-subscription-id>'
tenant_id = '<your-tenant-id>'
client_id = '<your-client-id>'
client_secret = '<your-client-secret>'

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=client_id,
    secret=client_secret,
    tenant=tenant_id
)
```

4. Create a SqlManagementClient object:

```
sql_client = SqlManagementClient(
    credentials=credentials,
    subscription_id=subscription_id
)
```

5. Check if SQL auditing is enabled:

```
server_name = '<your-server-name>'
database_name = '<your-database-name>'

database = sql_client.databases.get(
    server_name,
    database_name
)

auditing_settings = sql_client.auditing_policies.get(
    server_name,
    database_name
)

if not auditing_settings.state == 'Enabled':
    # SQL auditing is not enabled, remediate it
```

6. Remediate the misconfiguration by enabling SQL auditing:

```
from azure.mgmt.sql.models import (
    ServerAuditingPolicy,
    ServerAuditingPolicyState,
    ServerAuditPolicy
)

audit_policy = ServerAuditPolicy(
    audit_actions_and_groups=['SUCCESSFUL_DATABASE_AUTHENTICATION_GROUP'],
    retention_days=30
)

auditing_policy = ServerAuditingPolicy(
    state=ServerAuditingPolicyState.enabled,
    storage_account_access_key='<your-storage-account-access-key>',
    storage_endpoint='<your-storage-endpoint>',
    storage_account_access_key_is_secondary=False,
    audit_logs_table_name='AuditLogs',
    audit_logs_table_state='Enabled',
    audit_policy=audit_policy
)

sql_client.auditing_policies.create_or_update(
    server_name,
    database_name,
    auditing_policy
)
```

7. Verify that SQL auditing is now enabled:

```
auditing_settings = sql_client.auditing_policies.get(
    server_name,
