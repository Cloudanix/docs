#### Using CLI

To enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Integration in Azure using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI and log in to your Azure account.

2. Run the following command to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Integration:

```
az security workspace-setting update --name 'default' --target-types 'AzureSubscription' --integration-types 'AzureDefenderForCloud' --status 'Enabled'
```

This command updates the workspace settings for the default workspace, sets the target type to Azure Subscription, sets the integration type to Azure Defender for Cloud, and enables the integration.

3. Verify that the integration is enabled by running the following command:

```
az security workspace-setting list
```

This command lists the workspace settings for all workspaces in your Azure account, including the status of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Integration.

4. You can also verify the integration status in the Azure Security Center by navigating to the Security Center dashboard and checking the status of the Azure Defender for Cloud integration.

That's it! You have successfully enabled Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Integration in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Integration" for Azure using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to install the Azure Python SDK using the following command:

   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-resource
   ```

2. Next, you need to authenticate with Azure using a Service Principal. You can create a Service Principal in Azure and get the credentials. Then, use the following code to authenticate with Azure:

   ```
   from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

   subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
   credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
       client_id='your-client-id',
       secret='your-client-secret',
       tenant='your-tenant-id'
   )
   ```

3. Once you are authenticated, you need to get the Resource Management client for Azure. You can use the following code to get the client:

   ```
   from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient

   client = ResourceManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
   ```

4. After getting the client, you need to get the resource group where the Azure Defender for Cloud Apps Integration needs to be enabled. You can use the following code to get the resource group:

   ```
   resource_group_name = 'your-resource-group-name'
   resource_group = client.resource_groups.get(resource_group_name)
   ```

5. Next, you need to enable the Azure Defender for Cloud Apps Integration for the resource group. You can use the following code to enable it:

   ```
   from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter

   security_center_client = SecurityCenter(credentials, subscription_id)
   security_center_client.auto_provisioning_settings.create_or_update(
       resource_group_name,
       {
           'name': 'default',
           'properties': {
               'auto_provision': 'On'
           }
       }
   )
   ```

6. Finally, you can verify that the Azure Defender for Cloud Apps Integration is enabled for the resource group by checking the Security Center settings in the Azure portal.

   That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Integration" for Azure using Python.
