<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate this issue using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps to remediate the misconfiguration:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using pip:

```
pip install azure-mgmt-resource
pip install azure-mgmt-security
```

2. Authenticate with Azure using the Azure CLI:

```
az login
```

3. Import the required modules and authenticate with Azure using the Azure SDK for Python:

```python
from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential
from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter

credential = AzureCliCredential()
security_center_client = SecurityCenter(
    credential=credential,
    subscription_id='<subscription_id>'
)
```

4. Get the list of recommendations from Azure Security Center:

```python
recommendations = security_center_client.recommendations.list()
```

5. Iterate through the recommendations and remediate them:

```python
for recommendation in recommendations:
    if recommendation.status == 'Active':
        remediation = security_center_client.remediations.begin_create(
            recommendation_id=recommendation.id,
            properties={}
        )
        print(f'Remediation created: {remediation.id}')
```

This code will create remediation tasks for all active recommendations in Azure Security Center. Once the remediation tasks are completed, the misconfigurations will be remediated.
