### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal using your credentials. 

2. Open Security Center: On the left-hand side menu, click on "Security Center". This will open the Security Center dashboard where you can view the overall security posture of your resources.

3. Navigate to the SQL Servers: In the Security Center, go to the "Security policy" section. Under the "Data & Storage" section, you will find "SQL servers". Click on it to view the security settings of your SQL servers.

4. Check Microsoft Defender for Cloud: In the SQL servers section, look for the "Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud" setting. If it is enabled, you will see a green checkmark or "On" status. If it is not enabled, you will see a red cross or "Off" status. This indicates a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft website. After installation, open your command prompt or terminal and type `az` to ensure it's installed correctly.

2. Login to Azure: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be redirected to the browser for login. Enter your credentials to login.
   ```
   az login
   ```

3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, select the one where your SQL Database Server resides. Replace 'my-subscription-id' with your actual subscription id.
   ```
   az account set --subscription 'my-subscription-id'
   ```

4. Check Microsoft Defender Status: Use the following command to check the status of Microsoft Defender for your Azure SQL Database Server. Replace 'my-resource-group' and 'my-sql-server' with your actual resource group and SQL server names.
   ```
   az security pricing list --resource-group 'my-resource-group' --name 'my-sql-server'
   ```
   In the output, look for the `pricingTier` field. If it's set to 'Standard', then Microsoft Defender for Cloud is enabled for your Azure SQL Database Server. If it's set to 'Free', then it's not enabled.

#### Using Python

1. Install Azure SDK for Python: Azure SDK for Python is a set of libraries that allow you to work with Azure services like Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, etc. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install azure
```

2. Authenticate with Azure: Before you can interact with Azure services, you need to authenticate. You can use Azure Identity library for this. Here is a sample code:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
```

3. Connect to Azure Security Center: Once authenticated, you can connect to Azure Security Center using Azure SDK for Python. Here is a sample code:

```python
from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter

client = SecurityCenter(credential, "<subscription_id>")
```

4. Check Microsoft Defender for Cloud: Now, you can check if Microsoft Defender for Cloud is enabled for Azure SQL Database Servers. Here is a sample code:

```python
defender_settings = client.pricings.get(scope_path="subscriptions/<subscription_id>/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers")

if defender_settings.pricing_tier == "Standard":
    print("Microsoft Defender for Cloud is enabled for Azure SQL Database Servers.")
else:
    print("Microsoft Defender for Cloud is not enabled for Azure SQL Database Servers.")
```

Replace `<subscription_id>` with your Azure subscription ID. This script will print whether Microsoft Defender for Cloud is enabled for Azure SQL Database Servers or not.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud for Azure SQL Database Servers in Azure using Azure console, please follow the below steps:

1. Login to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Navigate to the Azure SQL Database Server for which you want to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud
3. Click on the "Security" tab on the left-hand side of the screen
4. Under the "Threat detection" section, click on "Advanced Threat Protection"
5. Click on "Enable" to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for the selected SQL Database Server
6. A new window will open to configure the settings for Microsoft Defender for Cloud. You can choose the settings as per your requirement and click on "Save" once you are done.
7. Microsoft Defender for Cloud will now be enabled for the selected Azure SQL Database Server.

Note: Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a paid service, so you will need to have a valid subscription to enable it.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud for Azure SQL Database Servers using Azure CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI and login to your Azure account using the command:
   ```
   az login
   ```

2. Once you are logged in, set the subscription where your Azure SQL Database Server is deployed using the command:
   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
   ```

3. Next, enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for your Azure SQL Database Server using the command:
   ```
   az security atp storage enable --resource-group <resource_group_name> --storage-account <storage_account_name>
   ```
   Replace `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group where your Azure SQL Database Server is deployed and `<storage_account_name>` with the name of the storage account associated with the server.

4. Verify the configuration by running the command:
   ```
   az security atp storage show --resource-group <resource_group_name> --storage-account <storage_account_name>
   ```
   This command will display the current configuration of Microsoft Defender for Cloud for your Azure SQL Database Server.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud for Azure SQL Database Servers using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud for Azure SQL Database Servers in Azure using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter
```

2. Set up the credentials to authenticate to Azure:

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = "your-subscription-id"
```

3. Create an instance of the `SecurityCenter` client:

```python
security_center_client = SecurityCenter(
    credential=credential,
    subscription_id=subscription_id
)
```

4. Get the Azure SQL Database Server resource ID:

```python
resource_group_name = "your-resource-group-name"
server_name = "your-sql-server-name"

sql_client = SqlManagementClient(
    credential=credential,
    subscription_id=subscription_id
)

server = sql_client.servers.get(
    resource_group_name=resource_group_name,
    server_name=server_name
)

server_resource_id = server.id
```

5. Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for the Azure SQL Database Server:

```python
security_center_client.server_security_configurations.create(
    resource_group_name=resource_group_name,
    server_name=server_name,
    server_security_configuration_name="default",
    properties={
        "configuration_status": "Enabled",
        "data_collection": "Enabled",
        "auto_patching": "Enabled",
        "retention_days": 30
    }
)
```

This will create a new server security configuration named "default" and enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for the Azure SQL Database Server. The data collection and auto-patching features will also be enabled, and logs will be retained for 30 days.

Note: Ensure that the Azure SQL Database Server is already onboarded to Azure Security Center before executing the above code.
