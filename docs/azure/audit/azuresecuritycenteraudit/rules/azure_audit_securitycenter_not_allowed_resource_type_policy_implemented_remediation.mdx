<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the "Ensure Not Allowed Resource Types Policy Assignment In Use" misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI on your local machine or Azure Cloud Shell.

2. Run the following command to list all the policy assignments:

   ```
   az policy assignment list
   ```

3. Identify the policy assignment that is causing the misconfiguration. The policy assignment name can be found in the "name" field of the output.

4. Run the following command to delete the policy assignment:

   ```
   az policy assignment delete --name <policy-assignment-name>
   ```

   Replace `<policy-assignment-name>` with the name of the policy assignment that you identified in step 3.

5. Verify that the policy assignment has been deleted by running the following command:

   ```
   az policy assignment list
   ```

   The output should not contain the deleted policy assignment.

6. Once the policy assignment has been deleted, remediation is complete.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the Azure misconfiguration "Ensure Not Allowed Resource Types Policy Assignment In Use" using Python, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to authenticate to your Azure account using the Azure Python SDK. You can do this by following the instructions here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/azure-sdk-authenticate?tabs=cmd.

2. Once you have authenticated, you can use the Azure Python SDK to get a list of all the policy assignments in your Azure subscription. You can do this by using the `azure.mgmt.resource.policy` module and the `PolicyAssignmentsOperations` class.

   ```
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.resource.policy import PolicyAssignmentsOperations, PolicyClient
   from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient, SubscriptionClient
   from azure.mgmt.subscription import SubscriptionClient

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

   subscription_id = "<your-subscription-id>"
   policy_client = PolicyClient(credential, subscription_id=subscription_id)
   assignments = policy_client.policy_assignments.list()
   ```

3. Next, you can filter the list of policy assignments to find the ones that are not allowed. You can do this by checking the `notScopes` property of each policy assignment.

   ```
   for assignment in assignments:
       if assignment.not_scopes is not None:
           # This policy assignment is not allowed
           # You can delete it using the PolicyAssignmentsOperations.delete() method
           policy_client.policy_assignments.delete(assignment.id)
   ```

4. Finally, you can delete the policy assignments that are not allowed using the `PolicyAssignmentsOperations.delete()` method.

   ```
   for assignment in assignments:
       if assignment.not_scopes is not None:
           # This policy assignment is not allowed
           # You can delete it using the PolicyAssignmentsOperations.delete() method
           policy_client.policy_assignments.delete(assignment.id)
   ```

That's it! By following these steps, you can remediate the Azure misconfiguration "Ensure Not Allowed Resource Types Policy Assignment In Use" using Python.
