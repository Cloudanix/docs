### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the Security Center by clicking on "Security Center" from the left-hand side menu.
3. In the Security Center, click on "Security policy" on the left-hand side menu.
4. In the Security policy, click on "Management Group" or "Subscription" to view the security contact details. If no email is set, it indicates that there is a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install the Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. After installation, open your command prompt or terminal.

2. Login to Azure: Use the following command to log in to your Azure account. You will be redirected to the browser for login. Enter your Azure account credentials.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, select the subscription where you want to check the misconfiguration. Use the following command to set the subscription.
   ```
   az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"
   ```
4. Check Security Contact Email: Use the following command to check if the security contact email is set in the Security Center. If the output is empty, it means no security contact email is set.
   ```
   az security contact list --query "[].email"
   ```
This command will list all the security contact emails. If no email is set, it will return an empty list.

#### Using Python

1. Install Azure SDK: To interact with Azure resources, you need to install Azure SDK in your Python environment. You can do this by running the command `pip install azure-mgmt-security`.

2. Import Required Libraries: Import the necessary libraries into your Python script.

```python
from azure.identity import ClientSecretCredential
from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter
```

3. Authenticate with Azure: Use the `ClientSecretCredential` class to authenticate with Azure. You will need your tenant ID, client ID, and client secret, which you can get from the Azure portal.

```python
credential = ClientSecretCredential(
    tenant_id="your-tenant-id",
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",
)
```

4. Check Security Contact Email: Use the `SecurityCenter` class to interact with the Azure Security Center. You can then use the `security_contacts` property to get a list of all security contacts. If the list is empty or none of the contacts have an email address set, then there is a misconfiguration.

```python
client = SecurityCenter(credential, "your-subscription-id")
contacts = client.security_contacts.list()
if not contacts:
    print("No security contact email set.")
else:
    for contact in contacts:
        if not contact.email:
            print(f"No email set for contact {contact.name}.")
```

This script will print a message for each security contact that does not have an email address set. If there are no security contacts at all, it will print a different message.

By following these steps, you have now remediated the misconfiguration of "No Security Contact Email Set" in Azure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "No Security Contact Email Set" misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI on your local machine or in the Azure portal.

2. Run the following command to set the security contact email:

```
az security contact create --email <email_address> --name "Security Contact"
```

Replace `<email_address>` with the email address you want to set as the security contact. You can also replace "Security Contact" with a different name for the contact.

3. Verify that the email address has been set by running the following command:

```
az security contact show
```

This command will display the details of the security contact, including the email address.

4. If you need to update the security contact email address in the future, you can use the following command:

```
az security contact update --email <new_email_address> --name "Security Contact"
```

Replace `<new_email_address>` with the new email address you want to use for the security contact.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "No Security Contact Email Set" misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of "No Security Contact Email Set" in Azure using Python, you can follow the steps below:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.security import SecurityCenter
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
```

2. Authenticate with Azure using the `DefaultAzureCredential` class:

```
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
```

3. Create a `SecurityCenter` client object:

```
security_center_client = SecurityCenter(
    credential=credential,
    subscription_id="<your-subscription-id>"
)
```

4. Get the security contact email for the subscription:

```
resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(
    credential=credential,
    subscription_id="<your-subscription-id>"
)

subscription = resource_client.subscriptions.get("<your-subscription-id>")
security_contact_email = subscription.security_contact_email
```

5. If the security contact email is not set, set it to a valid email address:

```
if not security_contact_email:
    subscription.security_contact_email = "<your-email-address>"
    resource_client.subscriptions.create_or_update(
        subscription_id="<your-subscription-id>",
        parameters=subscription
    )
```

6. Verify that the security contact email has been set:

```
subscription = resource_client.subscriptions.get("<your-subscription-id>")
security_contact_email = subscription.security_contact_email
print(f"Security contact email: {security_contact_email}")
```

Note: Replace `<your-subscription-id>` and `<your-email-address>` with your own values.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of "No Security Contact Email Set" in Azure using Python.
