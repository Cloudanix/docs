### More Info:

Ensure that production Azure Key Vaults are recoverable in order to prevent permanent deletion/purging of encryption keys, secrets and certificates stored within these vaults. To make your Azure Key Vault instances recoverable, you need to enable both "Soft Delete" and "Do Not Purge" features.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

CISAZURE, CBP, ISO27001, SOC2, NISTCSF

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to portal.azure.com and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Access Key Vaults: On the left-hand side menu, click on "All Services". In the search bar, type "Key Vaults" and select it.

3. Select the Key Vault: From the list of Key Vaults, select the one you want to check for recoverability.

4. Check for Recoverability: Once you've selected the Key Vault, navigate to the "Properties" section. Here, look for the "Soft Delete" and "Purge Protection" settings. If "Soft Delete" is enabled and "Purge Protection" is disabled, then Key Vault Recoverability is not properly configured. If both are enabled, then Key Vault Recoverability is enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI commands, you need to have it installed on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website and follow the installation instructions.

2. Login to Azure: Open your command line interface and type the following command to login to your Azure account:
   ```
   az login
   ```
   Follow the prompts in your browser to complete the authentication process.

3. List all Key Vaults: Use the following command to list all the Key Vaults in your Azure account:
   ```
   az keyvault list --query "[].{name: name, resourceGroup: resourceGroup}"
   ```
   This command will return a list of all Key Vaults along with their respective resource groups.

4. Check Key Vault Recoverability: For each Key Vault, use the following command to check if recoverability is enabled:
   ```
   az keyvault show --name {KeyVaultName} --query "properties.enableSoftDelete"
   ```
   Replace `{KeyVaultName}` with the name of your Key Vault. If the command returns `true`, then recoverability is enabled. If it returns `false`, then recoverability is not enabled.

#### Using Python

1. Install Azure SDK: To interact with Azure services, you need to install Azure SDK in your Python environment. You can do this using pip:
```python
pip install azure-keyvault-secrets azure-identity
```

2. Import Required Libraries: Import the necessary libraries into your Python script.
```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient
```

3. Establish Connection: Establish a connection to the Azure Key Vault using the DefaultAzureCredential which provides a simplified authentication experience to quickly start developing applications.
```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = SecretClient(vault_url="https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/", credential=credential)
```
Replace "https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/" with your Key Vault URL.

4. Check Recoverability: Now, you can check if the recoverability is enabled in the Key Vault. If the 'enabledForSoftDelete' and 'enabledForPurgeProtection' properties are set to true, then recoverability is enabled.
```python
def check_recoverability(client):
    properties = client.get_properties_of_secret_versions("<secret-name>")
    for secret_property in properties:
        if not secret_property.recovery_level:
            print(f"Recoverability is not enabled for secret: {secret_property.name}")
        else:
            print(f"Recoverability is enabled for secret: {secret_property.name}")

check_recoverability(client)
```
Replace `<secret-name>` with the name of your secret. This script will print out whether recoverability is enabled for each secret in the Key Vault.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to enable Key Vault Recoverability in Azure using the Azure console:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com).

2. Navigate to the Key Vault that needs to be remediated.

3. Click on the "Properties" tab.

4. Scroll down to the "Soft delete" section and click on the "Configure" button.

5. In the "Soft delete" blade, toggle the "Recoverable" switch to the "On" position.

6. Set the "Retention period" to the desired number of days.

7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

8. Once the changes are saved, the Key Vault will have recoverability enabled.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of Key Vault Recoverability in Azure using the Azure console.

#### Using CLI

To enable Key Vault Recoverability in AZURE using AZURE CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AZURE CLI on your local machine or use the AZURE Cloud Shell.

2. Login to your AZURE account using the following command:
```
az login
```

3. Once you are logged in, set the subscription where your Key Vault is located using the following command:
```
az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
```

4. Next, enable soft delete for the Key Vault using the following command:
```
az keyvault update --name <key_vault_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --enable-soft-delete true
```

5. Finally, enable purge protection for the Key Vault using the following command:
```
az keyvault update --name <key_vault_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --enable-purge-protection true
```

That's it! You have now enabled Key Vault Recoverability for your AZURE Key Vault.

#### Using Python

To enable Key Vault Recoverability in Azure using Python, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to install the `azure-mgmt-keyvault` package. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-keyvault
   ```

2. Next, you need to authenticate with Azure. You can do this by creating a `ServicePrincipalCredentials` object and passing in your Azure credentials:

   ```python
   from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

   credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
       client_id='<your-client-id>',
       secret='<your-client-secret>',
       tenant='<your-tenant-id>'
   )
   ```

3. Once you're authenticated, you can create a `KeyVaultManagementClient` object and use it to enable recoverability:

   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.keyvault import KeyVaultManagementClient
   from azure.mgmt.keyvault.models import VaultCreateOrUpdateParameters, VaultProperties, Sku, SkuName, AccessPolicyEntry, Permissions, SecretPermissions, StoragePermissions

   # Create the KeyVaultManagementClient object
   client = KeyVaultManagementClient(credentials, '<your-subscription-id>')

   # Get the resource group and vault names
   resource_group_name = '<your-resource-group-name>'
   vault_name = '<your-vault-name>'

   # Get the existing vault properties
   vault = client.vaults.get(resource_group_name, vault_name)

   # Enable recoverability
   vault.properties.enable_soft_delete = True
   vault.properties.enable_purge_protection = True

   # Update the vault
   parameters = VaultCreateOrUpdateParameters(
       location=vault.location,
       properties=vault.properties,
       sku=Sku(name=SkuName.standard)
   )
   client.vaults.create_or_update(resource_group_name, vault_name, parameters)
   ```

   This code will enable both soft delete and purge protection for the specified Key Vault.

4. Finally, you can verify that recoverability has been enabled by checking the `enable_soft_delete` and `enable_purge_protection` properties of the vault:

   ```python
   # Get the updated vault properties
   vault = client.vaults.get(resource_group_name, vault_name)

   # Check that recoverability is enabled
   if vault.properties.enable_soft_delete and vault.properties.enable_purge_protection:
       print('Recoverability has been enabled for the Key Vault')
   else:
       print('Failed to enable recoverability for the Key Vault')
   ```

And that's it! You have successfully enabled Key Vault Recoverability in Azure using Python.
