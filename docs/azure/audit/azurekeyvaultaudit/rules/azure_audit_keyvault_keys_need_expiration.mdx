### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to portal.azure.com and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Access Key Vault: On the left-hand side menu, click on "All Services". In the search bar, type "Key Vault" and select it from the dropdown list. This will open the Key Vault blade where you can see all the Key Vaults in your subscription.

3. Select the Key Vault: Click on the name of the Key Vault where you want to check the keys' expiration time. This will open the Key Vault's dashboard.

4. Check Keys' Expiration Time: In the Key Vault's dashboard, click on "Keys" under "Settings". This will open a list of all the keys in the Key Vault. Click on a key to see its details. In the key's details, look for the "Expiration Date" field. If this field is empty or the date is in the past, then the key does not have a valid expiration time. Repeat this process for all the keys in the Key Vault.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website.

2. Login to Azure: After installing Azure CLI, open your command prompt and type the following command to login to your Azure account:

   ```
   az login
   ```
   Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the login process.

3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, you need to select the subscription where the Key Vault is located. Use the following command to set the subscription:

   ```
   az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"
   ```

4. Check Keys Expiration Time: Now, you can check the keys in the Key Vault and their expiration time. Use the following command to list all the keys in the Key Vault and their attributes:

   ```
   az keyvault key list --vault-name "your-key-vault-name" -o table
   ```
   This command will display a table with all the keys in the specified Key Vault and their attributes. Look at the "ExpiresOn" column to see the expiration time of each key. If the "ExpiresOn" column is empty for a key, it means that the key does not have an expiration time set.

#### Using Python

1. Install Azure SDK for Python: Azure SDK for Python is a set of libraries that allow you to work with Azure services like Key Vault, Azure Storage, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install azure-keyvault-secrets azure-identity
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules and establish a connection to Azure Key Vault:

   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   key_vault_url = "https://<your-key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net"
   client = SecretClient(vault_url=key_vault_url, credential=credential)
   ```

3. Iterate over all the keys in the Key Vault and check their expiration time:

   ```python
   keys = client.list_properties_of_secrets()

   for key in keys:
       if key.expires_on is None:
           print(f"Key {key.name} does not have an expiration time.")
   ```

4. The above script will print out the names of all keys that do not have an expiration time set. If no keys are printed, then all keys in the Key Vault have an expiration time set.

Note: Replace `<your-key-vault-name>` with the name of your Key Vault. Also, make sure that the account you are using has the necessary permissions to list and view keys in the Key Vault.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of keys not having an expiration time in Azure, you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the Azure Key Vault service.
3. Select the Key Vault that contains the key that needs to be remediated.
4. Click on the "Keys" option from the left-hand menu.
5. Select the key that needs to be remediated.
6. Click on the "Settings" option from the top menu.
7. In the "Settings" menu, select the "Lifetime" option.
8. Set an expiration time for the key by selecting a duration from the dropdown menu or by specifying a custom duration.
9. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of keys not having an expiration time in Azure using the Azure console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of missing expiration time for keys in AZURE using AZURE CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AZURE CLI terminal and login to your AZURE account using the command:

```
az login
```

2. Once you are logged in, you can list all the available keys in your AZURE account using the command:

```
az keyvault key list --vault-name <your-key-vault-name>
```

3. Identify the key for which you want to set the expiration time and note down its name.

4. Next, set the expiration time for the identified key using the command:

```
az keyvault key set-attributes --vault-name <your-key-vault-name> --name <your-key-name> --expires <your-expiration-time>
```

Replace `<your-key-vault-name>` with the name of your key vault, `<your-key-name>` with the name of the identified key and `<your-expiration-time>` with the desired expiration time for the key in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.

5. Verify that the expiration time has been set for the key using the command:

```
az keyvault key show --vault-name <your-key-vault-name> --name <your-key-name>
```

This will display the details of the key, including the expiration time.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of missing expiration time for keys in AZURE using AZURE CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of keys not having an expiration time in Azure using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using the following command:

```
pip install azure-mgmt-resource
```

2. Authenticate to your Azure account using the Azure CLI or by setting the environment variables `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AZURE_TENANT_ID`.

3. Use the following Python code to set an expiration time for the keys:

```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.keyvault import KeyVaultManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.keyvault.models import AccessPolicyEntry, Permissions, SecretAttributes, SecretProperties

# Set the credentials
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id='<client_id>',
    secret='<client_secret>',
    tenant='<tenant_id>'
)

# Set the subscription ID and resource group name
subscription_id = '<subscription_id>'
resource_group_name = '<resource_group_name>'

# Create the resource management client
resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)

# Get the key vaults in the resource group
vaults = resource_client.resources.list_by_resource_group(resource_group_name, filter="resourceType eq 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults'")

# Create the key vault management client
kv_client = KeyVaultManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)

# Set the expiration time for the keys
for vault in vaults:
    vault_name = vault.name
    keys = kv_client.vaults.list_keys(resource_group_name, vault_name)
    for key in keys:
        key_name = key.name
        key_version = key.properties.version
        attributes = SecretAttributes(enabled=True, expires=datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=365))
        properties = SecretProperties(value=None, attributes=attributes)
        kv_client.vaults.set_secret(resource_group_name, vault_name, key_name, key_version, properties=properties)
```

In this code, we first set the credentials using the `ServicePrincipalCredentials` class. Then, we set the subscription ID and resource group name. Next, we create the `ResourceManagementClient` and `KeyVaultManagementClient` objects. Finally, we get the key vaults in the resource group and set the expiration time for each key using the `set_secret` method of the `KeyVaultManagementClient` object.

Note: This code sets the expiration time for the keys to one year from the current date. You can modify this value as per your requirement.
