### More Info:

In Microsoft Azure Key Vault, check for any keys that are about to expire and rotate them by creating a new version of these keys.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Operational Maturity, Security

### Compliance Standards

GDPR, ISO27001, HITRUST, SOC2, NISTCSF, PCIDSS

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of keys about to expire and need rotation in Azure using the Azure console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to the Azure portal using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the resource group where the key is stored.
3. Select the key that needs to be rotated.
4. Click on the "Rotate" button at the top of the page.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the key rotation process.
6. Once the key rotation process is complete, update the application or service that uses the key with the new key.

It's important to note that you should regularly rotate your keys to prevent unauthorized access and protect your resources. Azure provides different options for key rotation, such as automatic key rotation or manual key rotation, based on your requirements.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of expiring keys in Azure using Azure CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI in your terminal or command prompt.
2. Log in to your Azure account using the command "az login".
3. Once you are logged in, run the command "az account list" to see the list of all your Azure subscriptions.
4. Select the subscription that has the expiring keys using the command `az account set --subscription <subscription_id>`.
5. Check the current status of the keys using the command `az ad sp credential list --id <service_principal_id>`.
6. Create a new key using the command `az ad sp credential reset --name <service_principal_id>`.
7. The above command will return a JSON object that contains the new key. Copy the value of the "value" field.
8. Update the key value in your application or service that is using the service principal.
9. Verify that the new key is working by running a test on your application or service.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of expiring keys in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of key expiration and rotation for Azure using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using the following command: 

```python
pip install azure-mgmt-resource
```

2. Authenticate with Azure using Azure Active Directory credentials. You can use the following code snippet to authenticate:

```python
from azure.common.credentials import UserPassCredentials
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient

subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
username = 'your-username'
password = 'your-password'
tenant_id = 'your-tenant-id'

credentials = UserPassCredentials(username, password, tenant_id)
resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
```

3. Retrieve the list of expired keys using the following code snippet:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

expiry_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30) # Change the number of days as per your requirement

expired_keys = []
for key in resource_client.providers.get('Microsoft.Storage').resource_types.get('storageAccounts').api_versions[0].locations[0].properties.supported_operations[5].description.split('\n')[1:]:
    if datetime.strptime(key.split(':')[-1], '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ') < expiry_date:
        expired_keys.append(key.split(':')[0])
```

4. Rotate the expired keys using the following code snippet:

```python
for key in expired_keys:
    resource_client.providers.get('Microsoft.Storage').resource_types.get('storageAccounts').api_versions[0].locations[0].properties.supported_operations[6].invoke(
        resource_group_name='your-resource-group-name',
        account_name='your-storage-account-name',
        parameters={
            'keyName': key
        }
    )
```

Replace the placeholders in the code with the appropriate values for your Azure subscription, resource group, and storage account. 

These steps will help you remediate the issue of key expiration and rotation for Azure using Python.
