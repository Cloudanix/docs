<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the certificate key size misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Log in to the Azure portal and open the Azure CLI.

Step 2: Run the following command to list all the certificates in your subscription:

```
az keyvault certificate list --vault-name <vault-name> --query [].kid
```

Note: Replace `<vault-name>` with the name of your key vault.

Step 3: Choose the certificate that has a key size less than the recommended key size.

Step 4: Run the following command to update the certificate with a new key size:

```
az keyvault certificate update --vault-name <vault-name> --name <certificate-name> --policy "$(az keyvault certificate show --vault-name <vault-name> --name <certificate-name> --query policy)" --size <new-key-size>
```

Note: Replace `<vault-name>` with the name of your key vault, `<certificate-name>` with the name of the certificate you want to update, and `<new-key-size>` with the recommended key size.

Step 5: Verify that the certificate has been updated successfully by running the following command:

```
az keyvault certificate show --vault-name <vault-name> --name <certificate-name> --query policy.key_props.key_size
```

Note: Replace `<vault-name>` with the name of your key vault and `<certificate-name>` with the name of the certificate you updated.

Step 6: Repeat the above steps for all the certificates that have a key size less than the recommended key size.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the certificate key size misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of certificate key size being less than the recommended key size in Azure using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient
```

2. Instantiate the `WebSiteManagementClient` class:

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
resource_group_name = 'your-resource-group-name'
webapp_name = 'your-webapp-name'

client = WebSiteManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

3. Get the current certificate properties:

```python
certificate_name = 'your-certificate-name'
certificate = client.certificates.get(resource_group_name, certificate_name)
```

4. Check if the key size is less than the recommended key size:

```python
if certificate.key_size < 2048:
    certificate.key_size = 2048
    client.certificates.create_or_update(resource_group_name, certificate_name, certificate)
```

5. Update the certificate key size if it is less than the recommended key size:

```python
certificate.key_size = 2048
client.certificates.create_or_update(resource_group_name, certificate_name, certificate)
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of certificate key size being less than the recommended key size in Azure using Python.
