<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" misconfiguration for Azure using Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI in your terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to check the current value of the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" setting:

   ```
   az webapp config ssl list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name>
   ```

   Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group where your web app is located, and `<app-name>` with the name of your web app.

3. If the output of the previous command shows that the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" setting is not configured correctly, you can remediate it by running the following command:

   ```
   az webapp config ssl set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --min-tls-version 1.2 --key-size 2048
   ```

   This command sets the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" to 2048-bit RSA keys and the minimum TLS version to 1.2.

   Replace `<resource-group-name>` and `<app-name>` with the appropriate values for your web app.

4. After running the command, verify that the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" setting has been remediated by running the following command:

   ```
   az webapp config ssl list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name>
   ```

   The output should show that the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" setting is now configured correctly.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" misconfiguration for Azure using Azure CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" misconfiguration in Azure using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps to remediate this misconfiguration:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using pip:

```
pip install azure-mgmt-web
```

2. Authenticate with Azure using your credentials:

```python
from azure.common.credentials import UserPassCredentials
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient

# Replace the values with your Azure credentials
subscription_id = 'YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID'
username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'

# Authenticate with Azure using your credentials
credentials = UserPassCredentials(username, password)
web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
```

3. Get the list of web apps in your Azure account:

```python
web_apps = web_client.web_apps.list()
```

4. For each web app, check the certificate key types allowed and update the configuration if necessary:

```python
for web_app in web_apps:
    # Get the current certificate key types allowed
    site_config = web_client.web_apps.get_configuration(web_app.resource_group_name, web_app.name)
    allowed_key_types = site_config.min_tls_version
    if 'rsa' not in allowed_key_types:
        # Update the configuration to allow RSA certificate key types
        site_config.min_tls_version.append('rsa')
        web_client.web_apps.update_configuration(web_app.resource_group_name, web_app.name, site_config)
```

This code will iterate through all the web apps in your Azure account, check the certificate key types allowed, and update the configuration to allow RSA certificate key types if necessary.
