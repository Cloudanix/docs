### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Navigate to Key Vaults: From the left-hand menu, select "All services". In the "All services" box, search for "Key Vaults". Click on the "Key Vaults" service to open the Key Vaults dashboard.

3. Select a Key Vault: From the Key Vaults dashboard, select the Key Vault you want to inspect. This will open the Key Vault's overview page.

4. Check Key Types: In the Key Vault's overview page, click on "Keys" under "Settings". This will open a list of all keys in the Key Vault. For each key, you can see the key type under the "Type" column. Check if any of the keys have a type that is not allowed.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install the Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal and type `az` to ensure it's installed correctly.

2. Login to Azure: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be redirected to the browser for login. Enter your credentials and login.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. List Key Vaults: Use the following command to list all the Key Vaults in your Azure account. This will return a JSON object with all your Key Vaults.
   ```
   az keyvault list
   ```
4. Check for Allowed Certificate Key Types: For each Key Vault, you can check the allowed certificate key types using the following command. Replace `<your-keyvault-name>` with the name of your Key Vault.
   ```
   az keyvault certificate list --vault-name <your-keyvault-name>
   ```
   This command will return a list of all certificates in the specified Key Vault. You can then inspect the 'keyType' field for each certificate to see the type of key used. If the key type is not one of the recommended types (RSA-HSM, RSA, EC, EC-HSM), then it is a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

To check for allowed certificate key types in Azure Key Vault using Python scripts, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Azure SDK for Python**: You can install the Azure SDK for Python using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install azure-keyvault-certificates azure-identity
   ```

2. **Set up Azure Credentials**: You need to authenticate your application to access the Key Vault. You can use Azure Identity library which provides a set of credential classes for use with Azure SDK clients. You can set the `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AZURE_TENANT_ID` environment variables to your Azure Active Directory application (service principal) details.

3. **Create a Python Script to Check Key Types**: Here is a sample script that lists all the certificates in a Key Vault and checks their key types:

   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.keyvault.certificates import CertificateClient

   # Set the Key Vault URL
   key_vault_url = "<your-key-vault-url>"

   # Get a credential object using DefaultAzureCredential
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

   # Create a CertificateClient
   certificate_client = CertificateClient(vault_url=key_vault_url, credential=credential)

   # Get all certificates
   certificates = certificate_client.list_properties_of_certificates()

   # Check key types
   for certificate in certificates:
       certificate_policy = certificate_client.get_certificate_policy(certificate.name)
       print(f"Certificate: {certificate.name}, Key Type: {certificate_policy.key_type}")
   ```

4. **Run the Python Script**: Run the script in your terminal. It will print the names of all certificates in the Key Vault and their key types. You can then check if the key types are among the allowed types.

Remember to replace `<your-key-vault-url>` with the URL of your Key Vault.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" misconfiguration in Azure:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).

2. In the left-hand menu, click on "Security Center".

3. In the Security Center blade, click on "Security alerts" under the "Security management" section.

4. Find the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" alert and click on it.

5. In the alert details page, click on the "Remediation steps" tab.

6. Follow the instructions provided in the remediation steps to remediate the misconfiguration.

7. Once the remediation is complete, click on the "Mark as resolved" button at the bottom of the page.

That's it! By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" misconfiguration in Azure using the Azure console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" misconfiguration for Azure using Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI in your terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to check the current value of the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" setting:

   ```
   az webapp config ssl list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name>
   ```

   Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group where your web app is located, and `<app-name>` with the name of your web app.

3. If the output of the previous command shows that the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" setting is not configured correctly, you can remediate it by running the following command:

   ```
   az webapp config ssl set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --min-tls-version 1.2 --key-size 2048
   ```

   This command sets the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" to 2048-bit RSA keys and the minimum TLS version to 1.2.

   Replace `<resource-group-name>` and `<app-name>` with the appropriate values for your web app.

4. After running the command, verify that the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" setting has been remediated by running the following command:

   ```
   az webapp config ssl list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name>
   ```

   The output should show that the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" setting is now configured correctly.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" misconfiguration for Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Allowed Certificate Key Types" misconfiguration in Azure using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps to remediate this misconfiguration:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using pip:

```
pip install azure-mgmt-web
```

2. Authenticate with Azure using your credentials:

```python
from azure.common.credentials import UserPassCredentials
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient

# Replace the values with your Azure credentials
subscription_id = 'YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID'
username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'

# Authenticate with Azure using your credentials
credentials = UserPassCredentials(username, password)
web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
```

3. Get the list of web apps in your Azure account:

```python
web_apps = web_client.web_apps.list()
```

4. For each web app, check the certificate key types allowed and update the configuration if necessary:

```python
for web_app in web_apps:
    # Get the current certificate key types allowed
    site_config = web_client.web_apps.get_configuration(web_app.resource_group_name, web_app.name)
    allowed_key_types = site_config.min_tls_version
    if 'rsa' not in allowed_key_types:
        # Update the configuration to allow RSA certificate key types
        site_config.min_tls_version.append('rsa')
        web_client.web_apps.update_configuration(web_app.resource_group_name, web_app.name, site_config)
```

This code will iterate through all the web apps in your Azure account, check the certificate key types allowed, and update the configuration to allow RSA certificate key types if necessary.
