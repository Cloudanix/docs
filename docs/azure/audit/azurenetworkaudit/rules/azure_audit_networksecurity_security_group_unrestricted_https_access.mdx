### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Navigate to Network Security Groups: From the left-hand menu, select "All services". In the "All services" box, type "Network Security Groups". Select "Network Security Groups" from the search results.

3. Check Security Rules: Select the Network Security Group you want to inspect. In the Network Security Group window, select "Inbound security rules" or "Outbound security rules" depending on the traffic direction you want to inspect. 

4. Inspect Rules: Look for any rules that allow traffic from any source (0.0.0.0/0) to any destination (0.0.0.0/0) over port 443 (HTTPS). If such a rule exists, it means that unrestricted HTTPS access is allowed, which is a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. After installation, open your command prompt or terminal.

2. Login to Azure: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be redirected to the browser for login. Enter your credentials and login.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. List Network Security Groups: Use the following command to list all the network security groups in your Azure account. This will return a JSON object with all the network security groups.
   ```
   az network nsg list
   ```
4. Check for Unrestricted HTTPS Access: Now, for each network security group, check the security rules for unrestricted HTTPS access. Use the following command to list all the security rules for a particular network security group.
   ```
   az network nsg rule list --nsg-name {nsg-name} --resource-group {resource-group-name}
   ```
   In the output, look for rules where the `protocol` is `Tcp`, `destinationPortRange` is `443`, and `sourceAddressPrefix` is `*`. If such a rule exists, it means that unrestricted HTTPS access is allowed.

#### Using Python

Detecting unrestricted HTTPS access in a network involves checking if security groups allow unrestricted ingress (incoming) access on port 443 (HTTPS). Here's how you can do it using Python scripts with Boto3 for AWS, Azure SDK for Python, and Google Cloud Client Library for Python.

1. AWS:
   - Install Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python.
   - Use the `describe_security_groups()` function to retrieve all security groups.
   - Iterate over each security group and check the `IpPermissions` field for unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) on port 443.
   ```python
   import boto3
   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
   for sg in ec2.security_groups.all():
       for rule in sg.ip_permissions:
           for ip_range in rule['IpRanges']:
               if ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0' and rule['FromPort'] <= 443 and rule['ToPort'] >= 443:
                   print("Unrestricted HTTPS access detected in security group:", sg.id)
   ```

2. Azure:
   - Install Azure SDK for Python.
   - Use the `network_client.security_groups.list_all()` function to retrieve all network security groups.
   - Iterate over each security group and check the `security_rules` field for unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) on port 443.
   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
   network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
   for sg in network_client.network_security_groups.list_all():
       for rule in sg.security_rules:
           if rule.destination_address_prefix == '*' and rule.destination_port_range == '443':
               print("Unrestricted HTTPS access detected in security group:", sg.id)
   ```

3. GCP:
   - Install Google Cloud Client Library for Python.
   - Use the `compute.firewalls().list()` function to retrieve all firewall rules.
   - Iterate over each rule and check the `allowed` field for unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) on port 443.
   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1
   client = compute_v1.FirewallsClient()
   for firewall in client.list(project='your-project-id'):
       for rule in firewall.allowed:
           if 'IPProtocol' in rule and rule['IPProtocol'] == 'tcp' and 'ports' in rule and '443' in rule['ports']:
               for source_range in firewall.source_ranges:
                   if source_range == '0.0.0.0/0':
                       print("Unrestricted HTTPS access detected in firewall rule:", firewall.id)
   ```
Please replace 'your-subscription-id' and 'your-project-id' with your actual Azure subscription ID and GCP project ID respectively.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

The following are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the unrestricted HTTPS access misconfiguration in Azure using the Azure console:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Navigate to the resource group containing the virtual machine that needs to be remediated.

3. Select the virtual machine that needs to be remediated.

4. Click on the "Networking" tab on the left-hand side of the screen.

5. Under the "Inbound port rules" section, click on the "Add inbound port rule" button.

6. In the "Add inbound security rule" window, enter a name for the rule (e.g., "HTTPS Access"), select "HTTPS" as the service, and set the action to "Deny".

7. Under the "Source" section, select "IP Addresses" and enter the IP address range that needs to be denied access to the virtual machine.

8. Click on the "Add" button to add the rule.

9. Repeat steps 5-8 to add additional rules as needed for other IP address ranges.

10. Once all the necessary rules have been added, click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

11. Verify that the changes have been applied by attempting to access the virtual machine via HTTPS from an IP address that has been denied access. The access should be blocked.

#### Using CLI

The following are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the unrestricted HTTPS access misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI:

1. Open the Azure CLI and login to your Azure account using the command: 

   ```
   az login
   ```

2. Once you are logged in, set the appropriate subscription using the command:

   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
   ```

3. Next, list all the virtual machines in your subscription using the command:

   ```
   az vm list
   ```

4. Identify the virtual machine that has unrestricted HTTPS access and note its resource group and name.

5. Once you have identified the virtual machine, you need to create a network security group (NSG) and associate it with the virtual machine. Use the following command to create a new NSG:

   ```
   az network nsg create --name <nsg_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name>
   ```

6. Next, you need to create an inbound security rule to block all traffic on port 443 (HTTPS). Use the following command to create the inbound security rule:

   ```
   az network nsg rule create --name BlockHTTPS --nsg-name <nsg_name> --priority 100 --protocol Tcp --destination-port-ranges 443 --access Deny --direction Inbound --resource-group <resource_group_name>
   ```

7. Finally, you need to associate the NSG with the virtual machine. Use the following command to associate the NSG with the virtual machine:

   ```
   az network nic update --name <nic_name> --network-security-group <nsg_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name>
   ```

   Note: Replace `<nic_name>` with the name of the network interface card associated with the virtual machine.

8. Verify that the NSG has been associated with the virtual machine using the command:

   ```
   az network nic show --name <nic_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name>
   ```

   This command should return the details of the network interface card, including the NSG associated with it.

By following these steps, you can remediate the unrestricted HTTPS access misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

The following are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the "Unrestricted HTTPS Access" misconfiguration in Azure using Python:

1. First, you need to install the Azure SDK for Python. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   pip install azure
   ```

2. Next, you need to authenticate with Azure. You can do this by creating a Service Principal and then using its credentials to authenticate with Azure. You can follow the instructions here to create a Service Principal: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal

3. Once you have authenticated with Azure, you can use the Azure SDK for Python to retrieve a list of all the virtual networks in your subscription. You can do this by running the following code:

   ```python
   from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential
   from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient

   credential = AzureCliCredential()
   subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
   network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

   virtual_networks = network_client.virtual_networks.list_all()
   ```

4. Next, you need to loop through the list of virtual networks and for each virtual network, retrieve a list of all the subnets in that virtual network. You can do this by running the following code:

   ```python
   for virtual_network in virtual_networks:
       subnets = network_client.subnets.list(
           resource_group_name=virtual_network.id.split('/')[4],
           virtual_network_name=virtual_network.name
       )
   ```

5. For each subnet, you need to retrieve the network security group (NSG) associated with that subnet. You can do this by running the following code:

   ```python
   for subnet in subnets:
       nsg = network_client.network_security_groups.get(
           resource_group_name=subnet.id.split('/')[4],
           network_security_group_name=subnet.network_security_group.id.split('/')[8]
       )
   ```

6. Finally, you need to update the NSG to deny all inbound traffic to port 443 (HTTPS). You can do this by running the following code:

   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.network.v2021_02_01.models import (
       SecurityRule,
       SecurityRuleProtocol,
       SecurityRuleAccess,
       SecurityRuleDirection
   )

   nsg.security_rules.append(
       SecurityRule(
           name='DenyHTTPS',
           protocol=SecurityRuleProtocol.tcp,
           source_address_prefix='*',
           source_port_range='*',
           destination_address_prefix='*',
           destination_port_range='443',
           access=SecurityRuleAccess.deny,
           direction=SecurityRuleDirection.inbound,
           priority=1000
       )
   )

   network_client.network_security_groups.create_or_update(
       resource_group_name=nsg.id.split('/')[4],
       network_security_group_name=nsg.name,
       parameters=nsg
   )
   ```

By running the above code, you will update the NSG to deny all inbound traffic to port 443 (HTTPS) for all the subnets in all the virtual networks in your Azure subscription.
