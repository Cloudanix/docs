### More Info:

Ensure that Microsoft Azure network security groups (NSGs) do not allow unrestricted access (i.e. 0.0.0.0/0) on TCP port 135 in order to implement the principle of least privilege and effectively reduce the attack surface. Remote Procedure Call (RPC) TCP port 135 is used for client-server communications by Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) as well as other Microsoft Windows/Windows Server software.
