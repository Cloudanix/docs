### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to portal.azure.com and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Access DNS Zone: From the left-hand menu, select "All Services". In the "Networking" section, select "DNS zones". This will display a list of all DNS zones associated with your Azure account.

3. Check CNAME Records: Click on the DNS zone you want to inspect. This will open a new panel with details about the DNS zone. Look for the "Record set" section. Here, you can see all the DNS records associated with this zone. Look for any CNAME records in this list.

4. Inspect CName Records: Click on each CNAME record to inspect its details. Check the "Alias" field to see where the CNAME record is pointing. If it's pointing to an external domain that you don't recognize or control, it could be a potential vulnerability.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal and type `az login` to log in to your Azure account.

2. List DNS Zones: After logging in, you can list all the DNS zones in your Azure account by using the following command: `az network dns zone list`. This command will return a list of all DNS zones along with their properties.

3. List DNS Records: Once you have the list of DNS zones, you can check the DNS records for each zone by using the following command: `az network dns record-set cname list --zone-name <zone-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>`. Replace `<zone-name>` with the name of the DNS zone and `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group. This command will return a list of all CName records in the specified DNS zone.

4. Check CName Records: Now, you can check each CName record for vulnerabilities. Look for any CName records that point to a non-existent domain or a domain that you do not control. If you find any such records, it indicates a misconfiguration that could potentially be exploited by an attacker.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You will need the 'azure-mgmt-dns' library to interact with Azure DNS. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install azure-mgmt-dns
```

2. Authenticate with Azure: To interact with Azure resources, you need to authenticate your script. You can do this using Azure Service Principal which is an identity created for use with applications, hosted services, and automated tools to access Azure resources.

```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id = 'your_client_id',
    secret = 'your_secret',
    tenant = 'your_tenant_id'
)
```

3. Connect to Azure DNS: Once you have authenticated, you can connect to Azure DNS using the 'azure-mgmt-dns' library.

```python
from azure.mgmt.dns import DnsManagementClient

dns_client = DnsManagementClient(credentials, 'your_subscription_id')
```

4. Check for Vulnerable CName Records: Now that you are connected to Azure DNS, you can check for vulnerable CName records. A CName record is considered vulnerable if it points to a domain that no longer exists. You can check for this by trying to resolve the domain and checking if it fails.

```python
from socket import gethostbyname, gaierror

for zone in dns_client.zones.list():
    for record_set in dns_client.record_sets.list_all_by_dns_zone(zone.resource_group, zone.name):
        if record_set.record_type == 'CNAME':
            try:
                gethostbyname(record_set.cname_record.cname)
            except gaierror:
                print(f'Vulnerable CName record detected: {record_set.fqdn}')
```

This script will print out the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of any CName records that are vulnerable.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the CName Records vulnerability in Azure, follow these steps using the Azure console:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) using your credentials.

2. Navigate to the Azure DNS service by searching for "DNS" in the search bar at the top of the portal and selecting "DNS zones" from the results.

3. Select the DNS zone that contains the vulnerable CName record.

4. In the DNS zone overview, locate the CName record that needs to be remediated.

5. Click on the CName record to open its settings.

6. Review the CName record and ensure it is pointing to a trusted and valid destination.

7. If the CName record is pointing to an unauthorized or suspicious destination, click on the "Edit" button to modify the record.

8. In the edit mode, update the CName record to the correct and trusted destination.

9. Save the changes by clicking on the "Save" button.

10. After saving the changes, verify that the CName record is now pointing to the intended destination.

11. Repeat the above steps for any other vulnerable CName records in the DNS zone.

By following these steps, you can remediate the CName Records vulnerability in Azure by ensuring that the CName records are correctly configured and pointing to trusted destinations.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the Azure CName Records Vulnerability, you can follow the steps below using Azure CLI:

1. Install and configure Azure CLI: 
   - Install Azure CLI by following the instructions provided in the official documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
   - Once installed, authenticate with your Azure account using the command: `az login`

2. Identify the affected CName records:
   - List all the DNS zones in your Azure subscription using the command: `az network dns zone list`
   - Identify the DNS zone that contains the vulnerable CName record.

3. Delete the vulnerable CName record:
   - Use the command `az network dns record-set cname delete` to delete the CName record.
   - Specify the DNS zone name and the name of the CName record to delete.
   - Example command: `az network dns record-set cname delete -g <resource_group_name> -z <dns_zone_name> -n <cname_record_name>`

4. Verify the deletion:
   - Confirm that the CName record has been successfully deleted by listing the DNS records in the DNS zone using the command: `az network dns record-set list -g <resource_group_name> -z <dns_zone_name>`

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all affected CName records.

By following the above steps, you will be able to remediate the Azure CName Records Vulnerability using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the CName Records vulnerability in Azure Network using Python, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```python
   pip install azure-mgmt-dns
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.dns import DnsManagementClient
   ```

3. Authenticate with Azure using your credentials:
   ```python
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   dns_client = DnsManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
   ```

4. Get the list of DNS zones in your Azure subscription:
   ```python
   zones = dns_client.zones.list()
   ```

5. Iterate through each DNS zone and check for CName records:
   ```python
   for zone in zones:
       cname_records = dns_client.record_sets.list_by_type(zone.resource_group, zone.name, 'CNAME')
       for record in cname_records:
           # Delete the CName record
           dns_client.record_sets.delete(zone.resource_group, zone.name, record.name, 'CNAME')
   ```

6. Save and run the Python script. It will delete all the CName records in your Azure DNS zones.

Note: Make sure to replace `subscription_id` with your Azure subscription ID.

Please ensure that you understand the impact of deleting CName records before executing the script. It is recommended to test the script in a non-production environment first.
