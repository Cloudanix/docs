### More Info:

Ensure that Microsoft Azure network security groups (NSGs) do not allow unrestricted access (i.e. 0.0.0.0/0) on TCP port 3306 in order to protect against malicious actors and significantly reduce the attack surface. TCP port 3306 is used by the MySQL Database Server, a popular open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) server.

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Login to Azure Portal: Sign in to your Azure portal using your credentials.

2. Navigate to MySQL Databases: From the left-hand menu, select "All services". In the "All services" box, search for "MySQL databases". Click on the MySQL databases to view all the MySQL instances in your Azure environment.

3. Check Network Settings: Click on the MySQL database instance for which you want to check the network access. In the instance dashboard, navigate to the "Connection security" under the "Settings" section. Here, you can see all the IP rules that are set up for your MySQL database.

4. Check for Unrestricted Access: In the "IP ALLOW LIST" section, if you see an IP range that is set as "0.0.0.0" to "255.255.255.255", it means that the MySQL database is accessible from any IP address, indicating unrestricted MySQL database access in the network.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine and sign in to your Azure account. You can install Azure CLI by following the instructions provided by Microsoft. Once installed, you can sign in to your Azure account using the following command:

   ```
   az login
   ```

2. List all the network security groups: The next step is to list all the network security groups in your Azure account. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   az network nsg list --output table
   ```

   This command will display a table that includes the names of all your network security groups.

3. Check the security rules for each network security group: For each network security group, you need to check the security rules to see if any of them allow unrestricted access to MySQL databases. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   az network nsg rule list --nsg-name <nsg-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --output table
   ```

   Replace `<nsg-name>` with the name of your network security group and `<resource-group-name>` with the name of your resource group. This command will display a table that includes the details of all the security rules for the specified network security group.

4. Look for rules that allow unrestricted access to MySQL: In the table displayed by the previous command, look for any rules that have 'MYSQL' as the destination port range and '*' (which means all) as the source address prefix. Such rules indicate that the MySQL database is accessible from any IP address, which is a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. AWS:
   - Use the boto3 library in Python to interact with AWS services. 
   - To check for unrestricted MySQL database access, you can use the EC2 and RDS clients to fetch all security groups and check their ingress rules.
   - Here is a sample script:
   
```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
response = ec2.describe_security_groups()

for security_group in response['SecurityGroups']:
    for rule in security_group['IpPermissions']:
        if rule['FromPort'] == 3306 and '0.0.0.0/0' in [ip['CidrIp'] for ip in rule['IpRanges']]:
            print(f"Unrestricted MySQL access detected in security group: {security_group['GroupId']}")
```

2. Azure:
   - Use the azure-mgmt-network library in Python to interact with Azure Network Watcher.
   - To check for unrestricted MySQL database access, you can fetch all network security groups and check their security rules.
   - Here is a sample script:

```python
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

for nsg in network_client.network_security_groups.list_all():
    for rule in nsg.security_rules:
        if rule.destination_port_range == '3306' and rule.source_address_prefix == '*':
            print(f"Unrestricted MySQL access detected in network security group: {nsg.id}")
```

3. GCP:
   - Use the google-cloud-compute library in Python to interact with GCP Compute Engine.
   - To check for unrestricted MySQL database access, you can fetch all firewall rules and check their allowed configurations.
   - Here is a sample script:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

client = compute_v1.FirewallsClient()

for firewall in client.list(project='your-project-id'):
    for allowed in firewall.allowed:
        if allowed.IPProtocol == 'tcp' and '3306' in allowed.ports and firewall.source_ranges == ['0.0.0.0/0']:
            print(f"Unrestricted MySQL access detected in firewall: {firewall.name}")
```

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the unrestricted MySQL database access issue in Azure, please follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the Azure Database for MySQL service.
3. Click on the MySQL server that has the unrestricted access issue.
4. In the left-hand menu, click on "Firewalls and virtual networks".
5. Under "Firewall rules", click on "Add client IP".
6. This will automatically add a firewall rule to allow only your IP address to access the MySQL database. 
7. If you need to grant access to a specific IP range, click on "Add existing virtual network" and select the virtual network and subnet that you want to allow access from.
8. Save the changes by clicking on "Save".

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the unrestricted MySQL database access issue in Azure.

#### Using CLI

The remediation steps for Unrestricted MySQL Database Access on Azure using Azure CLI are as follows:

Step 1: Identify the MySQL Database Server that has unrestricted access.

```
az mysql server list
```

Step 2: Get the details of the MySQL Database Server.

```
az mysql server show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <mysql-server-name>
```

Step 3: Update the firewall rules for the MySQL Database Server to restrict access to specific IP addresses or IP ranges.

```
az mysql server firewall-rule create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <mysql-server-name> --name <firewall-rule-name> --start-ip-address <start-ip-address> --end-ip-address <end-ip-address>
```

Note: Replace the `<resource-group-name>`, `<mysql-server-name>`, `<firewall-rule-name>`, `<start-ip-address>`, and `<end-ip-address>` with the appropriate values.

Step 4: Delete the existing firewall rule that allows unrestricted access.

```
az mysql server firewall-rule delete --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <mysql-server-name> --name <firewall-rule-name>
```

Note: Replace the `<resource-group-name>`, `<mysql-server-name>`, and `<firewall-rule-name>` with the appropriate values.

Step 5: Verify that the firewall rules have been updated successfully.

```
az mysql server firewall-rule list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <mysql-server-name>
```

Note: Replace the `<resource-group-name>` and `<mysql-server-name>` with the appropriate values.

By following these steps, you can remediate the Unrestricted MySQL Database Access issue on Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the unrestricted MySQL database access issue in Azure using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Install the Azure SDK for Python using pip

```python
pip install azure
```

Step 2: Connect to the Azure account using the Azure SDK for Python

```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.rdbms.mysql import MySQLManagementClient

# Define the credentials
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
client_id = 'your-client-id'
secret = 'your-client-secret'
tenant = 'your-tenant-id'

# Authenticate the credentials
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=client_id,
    secret=secret,
    tenant=tenant
)

# Connect to the Azure account
resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
mysql_client = MySQLManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
```

Step 3: Get the list of MySQL servers in the Azure account

```python
# Get the list of MySQL servers
mysql_servers = mysql_client.servers.list_by_subscription()

# Loop through the MySQL servers
for server in mysql_servers:
    # Get the firewall rules for the MySQL server
    firewall_rules = mysql_client.firewall_rules.list_by_server(resource_group_name=server.resource_group, server_name=server.name)
    
    # Loop through the firewall rules
    for rule in firewall_rules:
        # Check if the rule is unrestricted
        if rule.start_ip_address == '0.0.0.0' and rule.end_ip_address == '255.255.255.255':
            # Remove the unrestricted rule
            mysql_client.firewall_rules.delete(resource_group_name=server.resource_group, server_name=server.name, firewall_rule_name=rule.name)
```

Step 4: Save the Python script and run it to remediate the unrestricted MySQL database access issue in Azure.

Note: This Python script will remove all the firewall rules that allow unrestricted MySQL database access. If you have specific IP addresses that need access, you will need to modify the script accordingly.
