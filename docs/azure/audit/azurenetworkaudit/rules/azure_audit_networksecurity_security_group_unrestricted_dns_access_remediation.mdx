<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate Unrestricted DNS Access in AZURE using AZURE CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AZURE CLI and login to your AZURE account.
2. Run the following command to list all the virtual networks in your subscription:
   ```
   az network vnet list
   ```
3. Identify the virtual network that has unrestricted DNS access.
4. Run the following command to update the virtual network and restrict DNS access:
   ```
   az network vnet update --name <virtual_network_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --dns-servers ""
   ```
   Replace `<virtual_network_name>` with the name of the virtual network that has unrestricted DNS access and `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group that contains the virtual network.
5. After running the command, verify that the DNS servers are restricted by running the following command:
   ```
   az network vnet show --name <virtual_network_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --query 'dnsServers'
   ```
   This command should return an empty array, which means that DNS access is restricted.

By following these steps, you can remediate Unrestricted DNS Access in AZURE using AZURE CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate unrestricted DNS access in Azure using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using pip:

```
pip install azure-mgmt-dns
```

2. Import the necessary modules:

```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.dns import DnsManagementClient
```

3. Authenticate using Service Principal credentials:

```python
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id='<client-id>',
    secret='<client-secret>',
    tenant='<tenant-id>'
)
```

Replace the `<client-id>`, `<client-secret>`, and `<tenant-id>` with your own values.

4. Create a DNS management client:

```python
dns_client = DnsManagementClient(credentials, '<subscription-id>')
```

Replace `<subscription-id>` with your own subscription ID.

5. Get the DNS zone that needs to be remediated:

```python
zone_name = '<zone-name>'
resource_group_name = '<resource-group-name>'
zone = dns_client.zones.get(resource_group_name, zone_name)
```

Replace `<zone-name>` and `<resource-group-name>` with your own values.

6. Remove any records that allow unrestricted access:

```python
for record in zone.records:
    if record.a_records:
        for a_record in record.a_records:
            if a_record.ipv4_address == '0.0.0.0':
                zone.records.remove(record)
    if record.aaaa_records:
        for aaaa_record in record.aaaa_records:
            if aaaa_record.ipv6_address == '::':
                zone.records.remove(record)
```

This code loops through all the records in the zone and removes any A or AAAA records that allow unrestricted access.

7. Update the DNS zone:

```python
dns_client.zones.create_or_update(resource_group_name, zone_name, zone)
```

This code updates the DNS zone with the changes made in step 6.

That's it! This code should remediate unrestricted DNS access in Azure using Python.
