### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal by entering "https://portal.azure.com" in your web browser. Enter your login credentials to access your Azure account.

2. Navigate to Network Security Groups: From the left-hand side menu, select "All services". In the "All services" box, type "Network Security Groups". Select it from the dropdown list.

3. Check for Telnet Access: Once you are in the Network Security Groups, select the specific group you want to check. In the settings pane, select "Inbound security rules". Look for any rules that have "Destination Port Ranges" set to 23, which is the port for Telnet. 

4. Verify the Source: Check the "Source" column for the rule. If it is set to "Any", "Internet", "0.0.0.0", or "::/0", it means that Telnet access is unrestricted, which is a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install the Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal and type `az login` to log in to your Azure account.

2. List Network Security Groups: The first step to check for unrestricted Telnet access is to list all the Network Security Groups (NSGs) in your Azure account. You can do this by running the following command: `az network nsg list --query "[].{Name:name, ResourceGroup:resourceGroup}" -o table`. This command will display a table with the names of all NSGs and their respective resource groups.

3. Check Security Rules: For each NSG, you need to check the security rules to see if any allow unrestricted Telnet access. You can do this by running the following command for each NSG: `az network nsg rule list --nsg-name <NSG Name> --resource-group <Resource Group Name> --query "[?protocol=='Tcp' && direction=='Inbound' && access=='Allow' && destinationPortRange=='23']" -o table`. Replace `<NSG Name>` and `<Resource Group Name>` with the name of the NSG and its resource group respectively. This command will display a table with the details of any rules that allow unrestricted Telnet access.

4. Analyze the Output: If the output from the previous command is empty, then there are no rules allowing unrestricted Telnet access. However, if the output contains any rules, then unrestricted Telnet access is allowed. The details of the rules will help you identify where the misconfiguration is.

#### Using Python

1. Import the necessary libraries: You will need the 'boto3' library for AWS, 'azure-mgmt-network' for Azure, and 'google-cloud-securitycenter' for GCP. These libraries allow you to interact with the respective cloud services using Python.

```python
import boto3
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
from google.cloud import securitycenter_v1
```

2. AWS: Use the 'boto3' library to create a client for the 'ec2' service. Then, use the 'describe_security_groups' method to get a list of all security groups. Iterate over the list and check the 'IpPermissions' for each security group. If 'ToPort' is 23 (the port for Telnet) and 'CidrIp' is '0.0.0.0/0' (which means all IP addresses), then Telnet access is unrestricted.

```python
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
response = ec2.describe_security_groups()
for group in response['SecurityGroups']:
    for permission in group['IpPermissions']:
        if permission['ToPort'] == 23 and '0.0.0.0/0' in [ip_range['CidrIp'] for ip_range in permission['IpRanges']]:
            print(f"Unrestricted Telnet access detected in security group {group['GroupId']}")
```

3. Azure: Use the 'NetworkManagementClient' to get a list of all network security groups. Iterate over the list and check the 'security_rules' for each group. If 'destination_port_range' is 23 and 'source_address_prefix' is '*', then Telnet access is unrestricted.

```python
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
for group in network_client.network_security_groups.list_all():
    for rule in group.security_rules:
        if rule.destination_port_range == '23' and rule.source_address_prefix == '*':
            print(f"Unrestricted Telnet access detected in network security group {group.name}")
```

4. GCP: Use the 'SecurityCenterClient' to get a list of all findings. Iterate over the list and check the 'category' of each finding. If the category is 'OPEN_FIREWALL_PORT' and the 'port' is 23, then Telnet access is unrestricted.

```python
client = securitycenter_v1.SecurityCenterClient()
for finding in client.list_findings(request={"parent": "organizations/{org_id}/sources/{source_id}"}):
    if finding.category == 'OPEN_FIREWALL_PORT' and finding.port == 23:
        print(f"Unrestricted Telnet access detected in finding {finding.name}")
```

Please replace `{org_id}` and `{source_id}` with your organization ID and source ID respectively.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate "Unrestricted Telnet Access" misconfiguration in Azure using Azure console:

1. Open the Azure portal and log in to your account.
2. Navigate to the "Security Center" from the left-hand side menu.
3. Click on the "Security Center" blade and then click on "Security Alerts" from the left-hand side menu.
4. Search for the alert related to "Unrestricted Telnet Access".
5. Click on the alert to get more details about the misconfiguration.
6. Click on "Remediate" button to start the remediation process.
7. In the remediation window, select the "Apply to subscription" option.
8. Click on "Remediate" again to start the remediation process.

Once the remediation process is completed, the "Unrestricted Telnet Access" misconfiguration will be remediated in Azure. 

Note: You can also use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to remediate this misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of unrestricted Telnet access in Azure using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open Azure CLI and login to your Azure account using the following command:

   ```
   az login
   ```

2. Once you are logged in, set the correct subscription using the following command:

   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
   ```

3. Next, find the network security group (NSG) that is associated with the virtual machine (VM) that has unrestricted Telnet access. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   az network nsg list --query "[?contains(defaultSecurityRules[].destinationPortRange, '23')].{Name:name, ResourceGroup:resourceGroup}"
   ```

   This command will list all the NSGs that have a default security rule allowing traffic on port 23 (Telnet).

4. Once you have identified the NSG, you can update the default security rule to deny Telnet traffic using the following command:

   ```
   az network nsg rule update --name "AllowTelnet" --nsg-name <nsg_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --access Deny --protocol Tcp --direction Inbound --priority 1000 --destination-port-range 23
   ```

   This command will update the default security rule in the NSG to deny Telnet traffic on port 23.

5. Finally, verify that the default security rule has been updated by running the following command:

   ```
   az network nsg show --name <nsg_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name>
   ```

   This command will show the details of the NSG, including the updated default security rule.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of unrestricted Telnet access in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate Unrestricted Telnet Access in Azure using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using the following command:

```
pip install azure
```

2. Use the following Python script to remediate the issue:

```python
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

# Fill in your Azure credentials
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
client_id = 'your-client-id'
secret = 'your-client-secret'
tenant = 'your-tenant-id'

# Fill in the name of the resource group and the network security group
resource_group_name = 'your-resource-group-name'
network_security_group_name = 'your-network-security-group-name'

# Create the credentials object
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=client_id,
    secret=secret,
    tenant=tenant
)

# Create the network management client object
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)

# Get the network security group
network_security_group = network_client.network_security_groups.get(
    resource_group_name,
    network_security_group_name
)

# Remove the inbound rule for telnet
telnet_rule = next((r for r in network_security_group.security_rules if r.name == 'AllowTelnet'), None)
if telnet_rule:
    network_security_group.security_rules.remove(telnet_rule)

# Update the network security group
network_client.network_security_groups.create_or_update(
    resource_group_name,
    network_security_group_name,
    network_security_group
)

print('Telnet rule removed successfully.')
```

3. Replace the placeholders in the script with your Azure credentials, resource group name, and network security group name.

4. Run the script using the following command:

```
python remediate_telnet.py
```

This will remove the inbound rule for telnet in the specified network security group, thus remediating the Unrestricted Telnet Access issue.
