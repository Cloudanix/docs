<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate unrestricted SSH access in Azure, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the virtual machine that has unrestricted SSH access.
3. Click on the "Networking" tab in the left-hand menu.
4. Under "Inbound port rules," click on "Add inbound port rule."
5. In the "Add inbound security rule" window, enter a name for the rule (e.g., "SSH access restricted").
6. Under "Destination port ranges," enter "22" (or the port number that SSH is using).
7. Under "Source," select "IP Addresses."
8. Under "Source IP addresses," enter the IP address or range that should have access to SSH (e.g., your own IP address or a specific subnet).
9. Under "Action," select "Allow."
10. Click "Add" to create the rule.
11. Repeat steps 4-10 for any other virtual machines that have unrestricted SSH access.

By following these steps, you have now restricted SSH access to only the specified IP address or range, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access to your virtual machines.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The following are the steps to remediate unrestricted SSH access in AZURE using AZURE CLI:

1. Login to your Azure account using the Azure CLI command: 

   `az login`

2. Once you are logged in, select the subscription that contains the virtual machine you want to remediate by using the command:

   `az account set --subscription <subscription-id>`

3. Get the name of the virtual machine you want to remediate by using the command:

   `az vm list --query "[].{name:name}" -o table`

4. Once you have identified the virtual machine, get the resource group name by using the command:

   `az vm show --name <vm-name> --query "resourceGroup" -o tsv`

5. Next, get the network security group associated with the virtual machine by using the command:

   `az vm show --name <vm-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --query "networkProfile.networkInterfaces[].id" -o tsv | xargs az network nic show --ids --query "networkSecurityGroup.id" -o tsv`

6. Get the name of the network security group by using the command:

   `az network nsg list --query "[].{name:name}" -o table`

7. Once you have identified the network security group, get the name of the security rule that allows unrestricted SSH access by using the command:

   `az network nsg rule list --nsg-name <nsg-name> --query "[?access=='Allow' && protocol=='Tcp' && destinationPortRange=='22' && destinationAddressPrefix=='*'].name" -o tsv`

8. Finally, delete the security rule that allows unrestricted SSH access by using the command:

   `az network nsg rule delete --name <rule-name> --nsg-name <nsg-name>`

   Note: Replace `<subscription-id>`, `<vm-name>`, `<resource-group-name>`, `<nsg-name>`, and `<rule-name>` with the actual values from your Azure environment.

After following these steps, the security rule that allows unrestricted SSH access will be deleted from the network security group associated with the virtual machine, thereby remediating the misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate unrestricted SSH access in Azure using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
```

2. Authenticate to Azure using the DefaultAzureCredential:

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(
    credential=credential,
    subscription_id="<subscription-id>"
)
```

3. Get the network security group (NSG) that needs to be remediated:

```python
nsg_name = "<nsg-name>"
resource_group_name = "<resource-group-name>"

nsg = network_client.network_security_groups.get(
    resource_group_name=resource_group_name,
    network_security_group_name=nsg_name
)
```

4. Get the NSG rules and find the rule that allows unrestricted SSH access:

```python
for rule in nsg.security_rules:
    if rule.name == "AllowSSH":
        if rule.destination_address_prefix == "*":
            if rule.destination_port_range == "22":
                # this is the rule that needs to be remediated
                break
```

5. Create a new NSG rule that allows SSH access only from a specific IP range:

```python
from azure.mgmt.network.v2021_03_01.models import SecurityRule

new_rule = SecurityRule(
    name="AllowSSH",
    access=rule.access,
    direction=rule.direction,
    priority=rule.priority,
    protocol=rule.protocol,
    source_address_prefix="<ip-range>",
    source_port_range="*",
    destination_address_prefix=rule.destination_address_prefix,
    destination_port_range=rule.destination_port_range
)

network_client.security_rules.begin_create_or_update(
    resource_group_name=resource_group_name,
    network_security_group_name=nsg_name,
    security_rule_name=new_rule.name,
    security_rule_parameters=new_rule
)
```

6. Delete the old NSG rule that allows unrestricted SSH access:

```python
network_client.security_rules.begin_delete(
    resource_group_name=resource_group_name,
    network_security_group_name=nsg_name,
    security_rule_name=rule.name
)
```

7. Verify that the new NSG rule has been created and the old rule has been deleted:

```python
nsg = network_client.network_security_groups.get(
    resource_group_name=resource_group_name,
    network_security_group_name=nsg_name
)

for rule in nsg.security_rules:
    if rule.name == "AllowSSH":
        if rule.destination_address_prefix == "<ip-range>":
            if rule.destination_port_range == "22":
                # the new rule has been created successfully
                break
    else:
        # the old rule has been deleted successfully
        pass
```

This will remediate unrestricted SSH access in Azure by creating a new NSG rule that allows SSH access only from a specific IP range and deleting the old NSG rule that allows unrestricted SSH access.
