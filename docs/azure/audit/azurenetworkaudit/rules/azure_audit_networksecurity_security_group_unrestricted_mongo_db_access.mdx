### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Navigate to the MongoDB instance: From the left-hand menu, select "All resources". In the resources list, find and select your MongoDB instance.

3. Check Network Rules: Once you've selected your MongoDB instance, navigate to the "Security" section in the left-hand menu. Under this section, select "Firewall and virtual networks". Here, you can see the list of IP addresses that are allowed to access your MongoDB instance.

4. Verify IP Rules: Check if any of the IP rules are set to allow access from all IP addresses (0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255). If such a rule exists, it means your MongoDB instance is accessible from any IP address, indicating unrestricted MongoDB access in the network.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine and then configure it. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. After installation, open your command prompt and type `az login` to log in to your Azure account.

2. List all MongoDB servers: Use the following command to list all MongoDB servers in a subscription:
   ```
   az cosmosdb list --query "[?kind=='MongoDB'].{Name:name, ResourceGroup:resourceGroup}"
   ```
   This command will return a list of all MongoDB servers along with their names and resource groups.

3. Check for unrestricted access: For each MongoDB server, check the firewall settings to see if it allows unrestricted access. Use the following command:
   ```
   az cosmosdb show --name {MongoDB server name} --resource-group {Resource Group name} --query "ipRangeFilter"
   ```
   Replace `{MongoDB server name}` and `{Resource Group name}` with the actual name of your MongoDB server and its resource group. If the `ipRangeFilter` is set to '0.0.0.0', it means the MongoDB server allows unrestricted access.

4. Repeat step 3 for each MongoDB server: You need to repeat the third step for each MongoDB server in your subscription. If any of them allows unrestricted access, you have detected a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: You will need the 'pymongo' library to interact with MongoDB. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install pymongo
```

2. Connect to the MongoDB instance: Use the MongoClient class from pymongo to connect to the MongoDB instance. You will need the connection string for your MongoDB instance. 

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

def check_mongodb_access():
    try:
        client = MongoClient('mongodb://<your-mongodb-url>:27017/')
        print("Connected successfully.")
    except:
        print("Could not connect to MongoDB.")
```

3. Check for unrestricted access: Once connected, you can check if the MongoDB instance is accessible without any authentication. If it is, this is a misconfiguration.

```python
def check_mongodb_access():
    try:
        client = MongoClient('mongodb://<your-mongodb-url>:27017/')
        print("Connected successfully.")
        db = client['<your-database-name>']
        collection = db['<your-collection-name>']
        documents = collection.find()
        print("Accessed data successfully.")
    except:
        print("Could not access data.")
```

4. Run the script: Finally, run the script. If it prints "Connected successfully." and "Accessed data successfully.", then your MongoDB instance is misconfigured and has unrestricted access. If it prints "Could not connect to MongoDB." or "Could not access data.", then your MongoDB instance is correctly configured and does not have unrestricted access.

```python
check_mongodb_access()
```

Please replace `<your-mongodb-url>`, `<your-database-name>`, and `<your-collection-name>` with your actual MongoDB URL, database name, and collection name.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate unrestricted MongoDB access in Azure:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Navigate to the "Azure Cosmos DB" service from the dashboard.

3. Select the database account that has the unrestricted MongoDB access.

4. Click on the "Firewalls and virtual networks" option from the left-hand side menu.

5. Under the "Firewalls and virtual networks" tab, select "Selected networks" and then click on the "Add my IP" button.

6. This will add your current IP address to the allowed list of IP addresses that can access the database.

7. If you want to allow access from other IP addresses, you can add them by clicking on the "Add IP range" button.

8. Once you have added the required IP addresses, click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

9. After saving the changes, you can verify that the unrestricted MongoDB access has been remediated by attempting to access the database from an IP address that is not on the allowed list. You should receive an error message indicating that access is denied.

That's it! By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the unrestricted MongoDB access in Azure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate Unrestricted MongoDB Access in Azure using Azure CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI on your local machine or use the Azure Cloud Shell.
2. Run the following command to list all the MongoDB accounts in your Azure subscription:

   ```
   az mongodb list --output table
   ```
   
3. Identify the MongoDB account that has unrestricted access.
4. Run the following command to update the MongoDB account to restrict access:

   ```
   az mongodb update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <mongodb-account-name> --public-network-access Disabled
   ```
   
   Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group in which the MongoDB account is located and `<mongodb-account-name>` with the name of the MongoDB account that you want to update.
   
5. After running the above command, the MongoDB account will be updated to restrict access and will only be accessible from within the virtual network or via a private endpoint.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the Unrestricted MongoDB Access misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Unrestricted MongoDB Access misconfiguration in Azure using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Install the Azure SDK for Python using pip command:

```
pip install azure
```

Step 2: Use the below Python code to remediate the misconfiguration:

```python
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

# Replace the values with your actual subscription ID, client ID, secret key and tenant ID
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
client_id = 'your-client-id'
secret = 'your-secret'
tenant = 'your-tenant-id'

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=client_id,
    secret=secret,
    tenant=tenant
)

network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)

# Replace the values with your actual resource group and network security group names
resource_group_name = 'your-resource-group-name'
nsg_name = 'your-nsg-name'

# Get the existing NSG rules
nsg = network_client.network_security_groups.get(resource_group_name, nsg_name)

# Remove the existing rule that allows unrestricted MongoDB access
for rule in nsg.security_rules:
    if rule.destination_port_range == '27017' and rule.destination_address_prefix == '*':
        nsg.security_rules.remove(rule)

# Create a new rule that allows MongoDB access only from specific IP addresses
from azure.mgmt.network.v2019_11_01.models import SecurityRule, SecurityRuleProtocol

rule_name = 'mongodb-access'
new_rule = SecurityRule(
    name=rule_name,
    protocol=SecurityRuleProtocol.tcp,
    source_address_prefix='your-ip-address',
    destination_address_prefix='*',
    destination_port_range='27017',
    access='Allow',
    direction='Inbound',
    priority=1000
)

nsg.security_rules.append(new_rule)

# Update the NSG with the new rule
network_client.network_security_groups.create_or_update(resource_group_name, nsg_name, nsg)
```

In the above code, replace the placeholders `your-subscription-id`, `your-client-id`, `your-secret`, `your-tenant-id`, `your-resource-group-name`, `your-nsg-name` and `your-ip-address` with your actual values.

This code will remove the existing rule that allows unrestricted MongoDB access and create a new rule that allows access only from specific IP addresses.
