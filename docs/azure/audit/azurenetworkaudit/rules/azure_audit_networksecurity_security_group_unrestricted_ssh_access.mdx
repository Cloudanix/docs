title: Unrestricted SSH Access
---

### More Info:

Check your Microsoft Azure network security groups (NSGs) for inbound rules that allow unrestricted access (i.e. 0.0.0.0/0) on TCP port 22 and restrain access to only those IP addresses that require it in order to implement the principle of least privilege and reduce the possibility of a breach. TCP port 22 is used for secure remote login by connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server.
