### More Info:

Ensure that all your Microsoft Azure network security groups (NSGs) restrict inbound/ingress access on TCP port 1433 to trusted IP addresses only in order to implement the principle of least privilege and significantly reduce the attack surface. TCP port 1433 is used by Microsoft Azure SQL Server, the relational database management system developed by Microsoft.

### Risk Level

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the unrestricted MSSQL Server Access misconfiguration in AZURE, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the Azure Portal and login with your credentials.

2. Navigate to the Azure SQL Server that you want to remediate.

3. Click on "Firewalls and virtual networks" under the "Security" section in the left-hand menu.

4. Ensure that the "Allow Azure services and resources to access this server" option is turned off.

5. Under the "Firewall rules" section, click on "Add client IP".

6. Enter the IP address of the client that needs to access the SQL server.

7. Click on "Save" to apply the changes.

8. Repeat steps 5-7 for all the clients that require access to the SQL server.

9. Once you have added all the required client IP addresses, turn on the "Allow Azure services and resources to access this server" option.

10. Click on "Save" to apply the changes.

With these steps, you have now remediated the unrestricted MSSQL Server Access misconfiguration in AZURE.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unrestricted MSSQL Server access in Azure using Azure CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Login to Azure CLI
```
az login
```

Step 2: Get the resource group name and MSSQL server name where the misconfiguration is present
```
az sql server list --query '[].{ResourceGroup:resourceGroup, ServerName:name}'
```

Step 3: Set the resource group and server name variables
```
$resourceGroup = "<resource-group-name>"
$serverName = "<mssql-server-name>"
```

Step 4: Get the firewall rules for the MSSQL server
```
az sql server firewall-rule list --resource-group $resourceGroup --server $serverName
```

Step 5: Identify the unrestricted firewall rule that allows all IP addresses to access the MSSQL server

Step 6: Delete the unrestricted firewall rule
```
az sql server firewall-rule delete --resource-group $resourceGroup --server $serverName --name <firewall-rule-name>
```

Step 7: Create a new firewall rule that allows only specific IP addresses to access the MSSQL server
```
az sql server firewall-rule create --resource-group $resourceGroup --server $serverName --name <firewall-rule-name> --start-ip-address <start-ip-address> --end-ip-address <end-ip-address>
```

Note: Replace the placeholders `<resource-group-name>`, `<mssql-server-name>`, `<firewall-rule-name>`, `<start-ip-address>` and `<end-ip-address>` with the actual values.

#### Using Python

To remediate the unrestricted MSSQL Server Access misconfiguration in AZURE using python, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Import the required libraries
```python
import os
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
```

Step 2: Set the credentials and subscription ID
```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
```

Step 3: Create the SQL Management client
```python
sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

Step 4: Get the list of MSSQL servers in the subscription
```python
servers = sql_client.servers.list()
```

Step 5: For each server, check if the firewall rules allow unrestricted access and remove them
```python
for server in servers:
    firewall_rules = sql_client.firewall_rules.list_by_server(resource_group_name=server.resource_group, server_name=server.name)
    for rule in firewall_rules:
        if rule.start_ip_address == '0.0.0.0' and rule.end_ip_address == '255.255.255.255':
            sql_client.firewall_rules.delete(resource_group_name=server.resource_group, server_name=server.name, firewall_rule_name=rule.name)
```

Step 6: Run the python script to remediate the unrestricted MSSQL Server Access misconfiguration in AZURE.

Note: The above code will remove all the firewall rules that allow unrestricted access to the MSSQL server. It is recommended to review the firewall rules before removing them to ensure that no legitimate access is blocked.
