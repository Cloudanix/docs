### More Info:

Ensure that Microsoft Azure network security groups (NSGs) do not allow unrestricted access on TCP ports 20 and 21 in order to protect against attackers that use brute force methods to gain access to Azure virtual machines associated with these NSGs. TCP ports 20 and 21 are used for data transfer and communication by the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client-server applications.
