### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Navigate to the Security Center: On the left-hand side menu, click on "Security Center". In the Security Center, click on "Networking".

3. Check for Unrestricted CIFS Access: In the Networking section, look for the "Adaptive Network Hardening" recommendations. If there is an Unrestricted CIFS Access, it will be listed here. 

4. Review the details: Click on the Unrestricted CIFS Access recommendation to view the details. It will show you the affected resources and other details related to the misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can run any Azure CLI commands, you need to install the Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website.

2. Login to Azure: After installing the Azure CLI, you need to login to your Azure account. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   az login
   ```
   Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the login process.

3. List Network Security Groups: Once you are logged in, you can list all the Network Security Groups (NSGs) in your Azure account by running the following command:
   ```
   az network nsg list --query "[].{Name:name, ResourceGroup:resourceGroup, Location:location}"
   ```
   This command will return a list of all NSGs in your Azure account, along with their names, resource groups, and locations.

4. Check for Unrestricted CIFS Access: For each NSG, you need to check if it has any security rules that allow unrestricted CIFS access. You can do this by running the following command for each NSG:
   ```
   az network nsg rule list --nsg-name <NSG-Name> --resource-group <Resource-Group> --query "[?access=='Allow' && (protocol=='All' || protocol=='Tcp') && direction=='Inbound' && (destinationPortRange=='445' || destinationPortRanges[?contains(@, '445')].length > 0)]"
   ```
   Replace `<NSG-Name>` and `<Resource-Group>` with the name and resource group of the NSG you are checking. This command will return a list of all security rules in the specified NSG that allow unrestricted CIFS access. If the list is empty, then the NSG does not have any such rules. If the list is not empty, then the NSG has one or more rules that allow unrestricted CIFS access.

#### Using Python

1. AWS:
   - Install and configure AWS CLI and Boto3 in your Python environment.
   - Use the following Python script to detect unrestricted CIFS access:

```python
import boto3
ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
sgs = ec2.security_groups.all()
for sg in sgs:
    for rule in sg.ip_permissions:
        for ip_range in rule['IpRanges']:
            if ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0' and rule['FromPort'] == 445:
                print("Security Group {} has unrestricted CIFS access".format(sg.id))
```

2. Azure:
   - Install and configure Azure CLI and Azure SDK in your Python environment.
   - Use the following Python script to detect unrestricted CIFS access:

```python
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

for sg in network_client.network_security_groups.list_all():
    for rule in sg.security_rules:
        if rule.destination_port_range == '445' and rule.source_address_prefix == '*':
            print("Security Group {} has unrestricted CIFS access".format(sg.id))
```

3. GCP:
   - Install and configure Google Cloud SDK and Google Cloud Client Library in your Python environment.
   - Use the following Python script to detect unrestricted CIFS access:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def list_firewalls(project):
    client = compute_v1.FirewallsClient()
    response = client.list(project=project)
    for firewall in response:
        for allowed in firewall.allowed:
            if allowed.IPProtocol == 'tcp' and '445' in allowed.ports and '0.0.0.0/0' in firewall.source_ranges:
                print("Firewall {} has unrestricted CIFS access".format(firewall.name))

list_firewalls('your-project-id')
```

Remember to replace 'your-subscription-id' and 'your-project-id' with your actual Azure subscription ID and GCP project ID respectively.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Unrestricted CIFS Access" misconfiguration in Azure, you can follow these steps:

1. Login to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the storage account that has the misconfiguration.
3. Click on the "Firewalls and virtual networks" tab from the left-hand menu.
4. Under the "Allow access from" section, select "Selected networks".
5. In the "Selected networks" section, click on the "Add existing virtual network" button.
6. Select the virtual network that is associated with the resource that needs access to the storage account.
7. Click on the "Add" button.
8. Under the "Allow trusted Microsoft services" section, select "Yes".
9. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you have restricted the access to the storage account to only the selected virtual network and allowed trusted Microsoft services to access it. This should remediate the "Unrestricted CIFS Access" misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unrestricted CIFS access in Azure using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI and connect to your Azure account.

2. Identify the storage account that has unrestricted CIFS access. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   az storage account list --query "[?networkAcls.defaultAction=='Allow'].name"
   ```

   This command will list all the storage accounts that have their default network access set to "Allow".

3. Once you have identified the storage account, you can update its network access rules to restrict CIFS access. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   az storage account update --name <storage-account-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --default-action Deny
   ```

   Replace `<storage-account-name>` with the name of the storage account that you want to update and `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group that the storage account belongs to.

4. After running the above command, you can verify that the update was successful by running the following command:

   ```
   az storage account show --name <storage-account-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --query "networkAcls.defaultAction"
   ```

   This command will return the default network access rule for the storage account. It should now be set to "Deny".

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated unrestricted CIFS access in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate unrestricted CIFS access in AZURE using python, follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
import os
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.storage import StorageManagementClient
```

2. Set the subscription ID, resource group name, and storage account name:

```
subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
resource_group_name = 'your_resource_group_name'
storage_account_name = 'your_storage_account_name'
```

3. Create a credential object to authenticate the programmatic access:

```
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
```

4. Create a storage management client object:

```
storage_client = StorageManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

5. Get the storage account properties:

```
storage_account = storage_client.storage_accounts.get_properties(resource_group_name, storage_account_name)
```

6. Check if CIFS access is allowed:

```
if storage_account.network_rules is not None and storage_account.network_rules.default_action == 'Allow':
    for ip_rule in storage_account.network_rules.ip_rules:
        if ip_rule.action == 'Allow' and ip_rule.protocol == 'TCP' and ip_rule.port_range == '445':
            print('Unrestricted CIFS access is allowed')
            break
else:
    print('No network rules found')
```

7. If CIFS access is allowed, update the network rules to deny CIFS access:

```
if storage_account.network_rules is not None and storage_account.network_rules.default_action == 'Allow':
    for ip_rule in storage_account.network_rules.ip_rules:
        if ip_rule.action == 'Allow' and ip_rule.protocol == 'TCP' and ip_rule.port_range == '445':
            ip_rule.action = 'Deny'
            network_rules = storage_client.storage_accounts.update_network_rules(resource_group_name, storage_account_name, storage_account.network_rules)
            print('CIFS access has been remediated')
            break
else:
    print('No network rules found')
```

These steps will remediate unrestricted CIFS access in Azure using Python.
