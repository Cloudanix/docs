title: Security Group Flow Logs should be retained for longer duration
---

### More Info:

Ensure that your Microsoft Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) have a sufficient flow log retention period, i.e. greater than or equal to 90 days, configured for reliability and compliance purposes. The retention period represents the number of days to retain flow log data recorded for your network security groups. Azure Network Security Group (NSG) flow log is a feature of the Network Watcher service, that allows you to view information about inbound and outbound IP traffic through an NSG.
