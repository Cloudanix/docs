### More Info:

Ensure that your Microsoft Azure network security groups (NSGs) restrict inbound/ingress access on TCP port 1521 to trusted entities only (i.e. IP addresses) in order to implement the principle of least privilege and vastly reduce the attack surface. TCP port 1521 is used by Oracle Database Server, which is an object-relational database management system (RDBMS) server developed by Oracle Corporation.
