### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the "App Services" section from the left-hand side menu.
3. Select the App Service for which you want to check the Automated Backups.
4. In the App Service menu, scroll down to the "Settings" section and click on "Backups".
5. In the "Backups" section, check if the "Automated Backups" is enabled or not. If it is enabled, you will see the backup schedule details, otherwise, it will show as disabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use the Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local system. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website.

2. Login to Azure: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be redirected to the browser for login.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, select the subscription where the App Service is located using the following command. Replace 'my-subscription-name' with your subscription name.
   ```
   az account set --subscription 'my-subscription-name'
   ```
4. Check Automated Backups: Use the following command to check if automated backups are enabled for your App Service. Replace 'my-resource-group' with your resource group name and 'my-webapp-name' with your web app name.
   ```
   az webapp config backup show --resource-group 'my-resource-group' --webapp-name 'my-webapp-name'
   ```
   If automated backups are enabled, you will see a JSON output with the backup configuration details. If not, the output will be empty.

#### Using Python

To check if Automated Backups are enabled in Azure App Service using Python scripts, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Azure SDK for Python**: If you haven't installed it yet, you can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-web
   ```
2. **Import Required Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries in your Python script:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
   from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient
   ```
3. **Authenticate and Initialize**: Authenticate using Azure credentials and initialize the WebSiteManagementClient:
   ```python
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'  # replace with your Azure Subscription ID
   resource_group = 'your-resource-group'  # replace with your Azure Resource Group
   web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
   ```
4. **Check for Automated Backups**: Now, you can check if Automated Backups are enabled for each App Service in the specified resource group:
   ```python
   for app_service in web_client.web_apps.list_by_resource_group(resource_group):
       backup_config = web_client.backup_configs.get(resource_group, app_service.name)
       if backup_config.backup_schedule is None:
           print(f"Automated Backups are not enabled for App Service: {app_service.name}")
       else:
           print(f"Automated Backups are enabled for App Service: {app_service.name}")
   ```
This script will print out the names of all App Services in the specified resource group, indicating whether Automated Backups are enabled or not.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To enable automated backups in Azure using the Azure console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal and select the virtual machine you want to enable automated backups for.

2. In the virtual machine's menu, select "Backup" under the "Operations" section.

3. In the "Backup" pane, click on the "Backup" button.

4. In the "Backup policy" pane, select the "Azure VM backup" option.

5. In the "Backup policy details" pane, select the "Daily" backup frequency and set the retention period as per your requirement.

6. In the "Backup policy details" pane, select the storage account where you want to store the backups.

7. Click "OK" to save the backup policy.

8. Once the backup policy is saved, click "Enable Backup" to enable automated backups for your virtual machine.

9. Azure will start backing up your virtual machine according to the policy you set.

That's it! Your virtual machine is now configured to automatically backup on a daily basis.

#### Using CLI

To enable automated backups for Azure using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

Step 1: Open the Azure CLI

Step 2: Run the following command to enable automated backups for the virtual machine:

```
az backup enable-for-vm --resource-group <resource-group-name> --vault-name <backup-vault-name> --vm <vm-name> --policy-name DefaultPolicy
```

Here, replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group that contains the virtual machine, `<backup-vault-name>` with the name of the backup vault where you want to store the backups, and `<vm-name>` with the name of the virtual machine that you want to enable backups for.

Step 3: Once the command is executed successfully, automated backups will be enabled for the virtual machine.

Note: You need to ensure that you have the necessary permissions to enable backups for the virtual machine.

#### Using Python

To enable automated backups in Azure using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps to remediate this misconfiguration:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using pip:

```
pip install azure
```

2. Import the necessary modules:

```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.recoveryservicesbackup import RecoveryServicesBackupClient
from azure.mgmt.recoveryservicesbackup.models import ProtectionPolicyResource, DailyRetentionSchedule, WeeklyRetentionSchedule, RetentionPolicy, SimpleRetentionPolicy, RetentionDuration
```

3. Authenticate with Azure using a service principal:

```python
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id='<client_id>',
    secret='<client_secret>',
    tenant='<tenant_id>'
)
```

Replace `<client_id>`, `<client_secret>`, and `<tenant_id>` with your actual values.

4. Create a `ComputeManagementClient` and `RecoveryServicesBackupClient`:

```python
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credentials, '<subscription_id>')
backup_client = RecoveryServicesBackupClient(credentials, '<subscription_id>')
```

Replace `<subscription_id>` with your actual subscription ID.

5. Get the resource group and virtual machine name:

```python
resource_group_name = '<resource_group_name>'
vm_name = '<vm_name>'
```

Replace `<resource_group_name>` and `<vm_name>` with your actual values.

6. Enable backup for the virtual machine:

```python
# Get the virtual machine
vm = compute_client.virtual_machines.get(resource_group_name, vm_name)

# Set the backup policy
policy = ProtectionPolicyResource(
    retention_policy=RetentionPolicy(
        daily_retention=SimpleRetentionPolicy(
            retention_duration=RetentionDuration(
                count=30,
                duration_type='Days'
            )
        ),
        weekly_retention=SimpleRetentionPolicy(
            retention_duration=RetentionDuration(
                count=4,
                duration_type='Weeks'
            )
        )
    ),
    daily_schedule=DailyRetentionSchedule(
        retention_duration=RetentionDuration(
            count=30,
            duration_type='Days'
        )
    ),
    weekly_schedule=WeeklyRetentionSchedule(
        days_of_week=['Sunday'],
        retention_duration=RetentionDuration(
            count=4,
            duration_type='Weeks'
        )
    )
)

# Enable backup for the virtual machine
result = backup_client.protection_policies.create_or_update(
    resource_group_name,
    'DefaultPolicy',
    policy
)

backup_client.protection_containers.trigger(
    resource_group_name,
    'Azure',
    'VirtualMachine',
    vm.id
)
```

This code sets a backup policy with a daily retention of 30 days and a weekly retention of 4 weeks, with backups occurring on Sundays. It then enables backup for the virtual machine and triggers the backup job.

Note that you may need to modify the backup policy according to your specific requirements.

7. Verify that backup is enabled for the virtual machine:

```python
# Get the backup status for the virtual machine
backup_status = backup_client.protection_status.get(
    resource_group_name,
    'Azure',
    'VirtualMachine',
    vm.id
)

# Check if backup is enabled
if backup_status.protection_status == 'Protected':
    print('Backup is enabled for the virtual machine')
else:
    print('Backup is not enabled for the virtual machine')
```

This code gets the backup status for the virtual machine and checks if backup is enabled.

That's it! With these steps, you can enable automated backups for a virtual machine in Azure using Python.
