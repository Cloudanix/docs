### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling Always On for App Services in Azure, please follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Navigate to the App Service that needs to have Always On enabled.

3. Click on the "Configuration" tab from the left-hand menu.

4. Scroll down to the "General Settings" section.

5. Toggle the "Always On" option to "On".

6. Click on the "Save" button at the top of the page to save the changes.

7. Wait for a few minutes for the changes to take effect.

Once Always On is enabled, the App Service will always be running, even if there is no traffic to the application. This ensures that the application is always available and responsive to incoming requests.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of not having "Always On" enabled for an App Service in Azure using the Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI command prompt or terminal.

2. Log in to your Azure account using the `az login` command.

3. Once you are logged in, select the subscription that contains the App Service that you want to remediate by using the `az account set --subscription <subscription_id>` command.

4. Use the `az webapp config set` command to enable the "Always On" feature for the App Service. The command syntax is as follows:

```
az webapp config set --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <app_service_name> --always-on true
```

Replace `<resource_group_name>` with the name of the resource group that contains the App Service, and `<app_service_name>` with the name of the App Service that you want to remediate.

5. Once the command is executed successfully, the "Always On" feature will be enabled for the App Service.

6. Verify that the "Always On" feature is enabled by checking the App Service's configuration settings using the `az webapp config show` command. The command syntax is as follows:

```
az webapp config show --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <app_service_name> --query alwaysOn
```

This command will return the value of the "Always On" feature, which should be set to "true" if the remediation was successful.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of not having the "Always On" feature enabled for an App Service in Azure using the Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate this misconfiguration for Azure App Services using Python, you can use the Azure Python SDK. Here are the steps to enable Always On for App Services:

1. Install the Azure Python SDK using the following command:
```
pip install azure-mgmt-web
```

2. Authenticate to your Azure account using the SDK. You can use the following code to authenticate using a Service Principal:
```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

TENANT_ID = '<tenant_id>'
CLIENT_ID = '<client_id>'
CLIENT_SECRET = '<client_secret>'
SUBSCRIPTION_ID = '<subscription_id>'

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=CLIENT_ID,
    secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
    tenant=TENANT_ID
)
```

3. Connect to the Azure App Service using the SDK. You can use the following code to connect to an App Service:
```python
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.web.models import SiteConfig

RESOURCE_GROUP = '<resource_group>'
APP_SERVICE_NAME = '<app_service_name>'

web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credentials, SUBSCRIPTION_ID)
site_config = web_client.web_apps.get_configuration(RESOURCE_GROUP, APP_SERVICE_NAME)
```

4. Modify the App Service configuration to enable Always On. You can use the following code to modify the configuration:
```python
site_config.always_on = True
web_client.web_apps.update_configuration(RESOURCE_GROUP, APP_SERVICE_NAME, site_config)
```

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration by enabling Always On for Azure App Services using Python.
