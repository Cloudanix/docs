### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not having automated backups enabled in Azure, please follow the below steps:

1. Login to the Azure portal using your credentials.
2. Select the virtual machine for which you want to enable automated backups.
3. Click on the "Backup" option from the left-hand side menu.
4. Click on the "+ Backup" button to start the backup configuration process.
5. In the "Backup Goal" section, select "Azure VM" as the backup item type.
6. In the "Backup policy details" section, select the backup policy that you want to use or create a new backup policy.
7. In the "Backup policy details" section, select the backup frequency, retention range, and time zone.
8. In the "Backup policy details" section, select the storage account where you want to store your backups.
9. In the "Advanced settings" section, select the encryption settings for your backups.
10. Click on the "OK" button to save the backup configuration.

Once you have completed the above steps, automated backups will be enabled for your virtual machine in Azure. You can now rest assured that your data is backed up and secure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling automated backups in Azure CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI in your preferred shell or terminal.

2. Login to your Azure account using the command:

```
az login
```

3. Once you are logged in, select the appropriate subscription using the command:

```
az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
```

4. Now, enable automated backups for a specific virtual machine using the command:

```
az backup protection enable-for-vm --resource-group <resource-group-name> --vault-name <backup-vault-name> --vm <vm-name> --policy-name DefaultPolicy
```

Here, you need to replace the <resource-group-name> with the name of the resource group where the virtual machine is located, <backup-vault-name> with the name of the backup vault where the backups will be stored, and <vm-name> with the name of the virtual machine for which you want to enable automated backups.

5. If you want to enable automated backups for all the virtual machines in a resource group, you can use the command:

```
az backup protection enable-for-vm --resource-group <resource-group-name> --vault-name <backup-vault-name> --policy-name DefaultPolicy --all
```

6. Once the command is executed successfully, automated backups will be enabled for the specified virtual machine(s) and the backups will be stored in the specified backup vault.

Note: You can also use the Azure portal to enable automated backups for virtual machines.

#### Using Python

To enable automated backups in AWS, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to create a backup plan and assign it to the resources that you want to back up. Here are the steps to remediate this misconfiguration using Python:

1. Install Boto3: 

```python
!pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules:

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

3. Create a backup plan:

```python
def create_backup_plan(client, plan_name):
    try:
        response = client.create_backup_plan(
            BackupPlan={
                'BackupPlanName': plan_name,
                'Rules': [
                    {
                        'RuleName': 'DailyBackupRule',
                        'TargetBackupVaultName': 'my-backup-vault',
                        'ScheduleExpression': 'cron(0 12 * * ? *)',
                        'StartWindowMinutes': 60,
                        'CompletionWindowMinutes': 10080,
                        'Lifecycle': {
                            'DeleteAfterDays': 30
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        )
        print(f"Backup plan '{plan_name}' created successfully.")
        return response['BackupPlanId']
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error creating backup plan '{plan_name}': {e}")
```

In this example, we create a backup plan with a daily backup rule that runs at 12:00 PM UTC and retains backups for 30 days.

4. Assign the backup plan to the resources:

```python
def assign_backup_plan(client, resource_arn, backup_plan_id):
    try:
        response = client.associate_backup_plan_with_resource(
            ResourceArn=resource_arn,
            BackupPlanId=backup_plan_id
        )
        print(f"Backup plan '{backup_plan_id}' assigned to resource '{resource_arn}' successfully.")
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error assigning backup plan '{backup_plan_id}' to resource '{resource_arn}': {e}")
```

In this example, we assign the backup plan to a resource identified by its ARN.

5. Connect to AWS and call the functions:

```python
# Connect to AWS
client = boto3.client('backup')

# Create a backup plan
backup_plan_id = create_backup_plan(client, 'MyBackupPlan')

# Assign the backup plan to a resource
assign_backup_plan(client, 'arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-01234567890abcdef', backup_plan_id)
```

In this example, we connect to the AWS Backup service using the Boto3 client, create a backup plan named 'MyBackupPlan', and assign it to an EC2 instance identified by its ARN.

Note: This is just an example of how to enable automated backups in AWS using Python. The specific steps may vary depending on the resource that you want to back up.
