### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal.

2. Navigate to the App Services and select the specific App Service you want to check.

3. In the left-hand menu, under the 'Development Tools' section, click on 'Configuration'.

4. In the 'Application settings' tab, look for the 'Remote Debugging' setting. If it is set to 'On', then remote debugging is enabled. If it is set to 'Off', then remote debugging is disabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI commands, you need to have Azure CLI installed on your system. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website.

2. Login to Azure: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be redirected to the browser for login.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. Select the subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, select the subscription where the App Service is located using the following command. Replace 'my-subscription-name' with your actual subscription name.
   ```
   az account set --subscription 'my-subscription-name'
   ```
4. Check Remote Debugging status: Use the following command to check the status of Remote Debugging in your App Service. Replace 'my-resource-group' with the name of your resource group and 'my-app-service' with the name of your App Service.
   ```
   az webapp config show --resource-group 'my-resource-group' --name 'my-app-service' --query remoteDebuggingEnabled
   ```
   If the output is 'true', then Remote Debugging is enabled. If the output is 'false', then Remote Debugging is disabled.

#### Using Python

1. Install Azure SDK: To interact with Azure services, you need to install Azure SDK in your Python environment. You can do this by running the command `pip install azure`.

2. Import necessary modules: Import the necessary modules in your Python script. You will need the `azure.mgmt.web` module to interact with Azure App Service.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient
```

3. Authenticate and initialize: Authenticate to Azure using the `DefaultAzureCredential` class, which will use your login credentials. Then, initialize the `WebSiteManagementClient` with your subscription ID.

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'  # replace with your Azure subscription ID
web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

4. Check Remote Debugging status: Now, you can check the Remote Debugging status of your App Service. You need to provide the resource group name and the name of the App Service. The `remote_debugging_enabled` attribute will tell you whether Remote Debugging is enabled or not.

```python
resource_group_name = 'your-resource-group'  # replace with your resource group name
app_service_name = 'your-app-service'  # replace with your App Service name

app_service = web_client.web_apps.get(resource_group_name, app_service_name)
print(f"Remote Debugging is {'enabled' if app_service.site_config.remote_debugging_enabled else 'disabled'}")
```

This script will print whether Remote Debugging is enabled or disabled for the specified App Service. If it prints "Remote Debugging is enabled", then there is a misconfiguration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of disabling remote debugging in Azure, you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the App Service that you want to remediate.
3. Click on the "Configuration" blade on the left-hand side of the screen.
4. Scroll down to the "Application Settings" section and click on it.
5. Locate the "Remote Debugging Enabled" setting and set it to "Off".
6. Click on the "Save" button at the top of the screen to save the changes.

Once the above steps are completed, remote debugging will be disabled for the App Service.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of disabling Remote Debugging in AZURE using AZURE CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open Azure CLI and login to your account using the command:

```
az login
```

Step 2: Once you are logged in, set the subscription where the misconfigured resource is located using the command:

```
az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
```

Step 3: To disable Remote Debugging, you need to update the Application Settings of the App Service. Run the following command to update the Application Settings:

```
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-service-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings WEBSITE_REMOTE_DEBUGGING_ENABLED=0
```

Here, replace `<app-service-name>` with the name of the App Service where Remote Debugging needs to be disabled and `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group where the App Service is located.

Step 4: Verify that Remote Debugging has been disabled by checking the Application Settings of the App Service using the command:

```
az webapp config appsettings list --name <app-service-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>
```

This command will list all the Application Settings of the App Service. Check if the value of `WEBSITE_REMOTE_DEBUGGING_ENABLED` is set to `0`.

Once you have completed all the above steps, Remote Debugging will be disabled for the App Service in AZURE.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of disabling remote debugging in Azure using Python, please follow the below steps:

1. Open Azure Cloud Shell and select Bash.
2. Run the following command to list all the web apps in your Azure subscription:
```
az webapp list --query "[].{name:name}" --output table
```
3. Select the web app that you want to remediate and run the following command to disable remote debugging:
```
az webapp config set --name <webapp-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --remote-debugging-enabled false
```
Note: Replace `<webapp-name>` and `<resource-group-name>` with the actual names of your web app and resource group respectively.

4. Verify that the remote debugging is disabled by running the following command:
```
az webapp config show --name <webapp-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --query "remoteDebuggingEnabled"
```
The output should be `false` which confirms that the remote debugging is disabled.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of disabling remote debugging in Azure using Python.
