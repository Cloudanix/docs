### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the "Disable Remote Debugging" misconfiguration in the Azure console:

1. Login to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) with your credentials.
2. Navigate to the Azure App Service that you want to remediate.
3. Under the App Service menu, click on the "Configuration" option.
4. Scroll down to the "Application Settings" section and locate the "Remote Debugging Enabled" setting.
5. Toggle the switch to "Off" to disable remote debugging.
6. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

That's it! Remote debugging is now disabled for your Azure App Service.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of disabling remote debugging in AZURE CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AZURE CLI and log in to your account.

2. Navigate to the App Service where the remote debugging is enabled.

3. Run the following command to disable remote debugging:

   ```
   az webapp config set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --remote-debugging-enabled false
   ```

   Note: Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of your resource group and `<app-name>` with the name of your app.

4. Once the command is executed successfully, remote debugging will be disabled for the specified app service.

5. You can verify the changes by running the following command:

   ```
   az webapp config show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --query remoteDebuggingEnabled
   ```

   Note: This command will return `false` if remote debugging is disabled.

6. Finally, you can confirm that remote debugging is disabled by trying to connect to the app service using remote debugging tools. You should no longer be able to connect.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of disabling remote debugging in Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Python script that you want to remediate.

2. Search for the line of code that enables remote debugging. This line of code may vary depending on the tool or library you are using for remote debugging. Some common tools are PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and PyDev.

3. Comment out or delete the line of code that enables remote debugging.

4. Save the changes to the Python script.

5. Test the Python script to ensure that remote debugging is disabled.

6. If the Python script is part of a larger application, ensure that all instances of the script have been updated to disable remote debugging.

7. Deploy the updated Python script to your cloud environment.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of disabling remote debugging in Python.
