### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of disabling remote debugging in Azure, you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the App Service that you want to remediate.
3. Click on the "Configuration" blade on the left-hand side of the screen.
4. Scroll down to the "Application Settings" section and click on it.
5. Locate the "Remote Debugging Enabled" setting and set it to "Off".
6. Click on the "Save" button at the top of the screen to save the changes.

Once the above steps are completed, remote debugging will be disabled for the App Service.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of disabling Remote Debugging in AZURE using AZURE CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open Azure CLI and login to your account using the command:

```
az login
```

Step 2: Once you are logged in, set the subscription where the misconfigured resource is located using the command:

```
az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
```

Step 3: To disable Remote Debugging, you need to update the Application Settings of the App Service. Run the following command to update the Application Settings:

```
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-service-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings WEBSITE_REMOTE_DEBUGGING_ENABLED=0
```

Here, replace `<app-service-name>` with the name of the App Service where Remote Debugging needs to be disabled and `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group where the App Service is located.

Step 4: Verify that Remote Debugging has been disabled by checking the Application Settings of the App Service using the command:

```
az webapp config appsettings list --name <app-service-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>
```

This command will list all the Application Settings of the App Service. Check if the value of `WEBSITE_REMOTE_DEBUGGING_ENABLED` is set to `0`.

Once you have completed all the above steps, Remote Debugging will be disabled for the App Service in AZURE.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of disabling remote debugging in Azure using Python, please follow the below steps:

1. Open Azure Cloud Shell and select Bash.
2. Run the following command to list all the web apps in your Azure subscription:
```
az webapp list --query "[].{name:name}" --output table
```
3. Select the web app that you want to remediate and run the following command to disable remote debugging:
```
az webapp config set --name <webapp-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --remote-debugging-enabled false
```
Note: Replace `<webapp-name>` and `<resource-group-name>` with the actual names of your web app and resource group respectively.

4. Verify that the remote debugging is disabled by running the following command:
```
az webapp config show --name <webapp-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --query "remoteDebuggingEnabled"
```
The output should be `false` which confirms that the remote debugging is disabled.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of disabling remote debugging in Azure using Python.
