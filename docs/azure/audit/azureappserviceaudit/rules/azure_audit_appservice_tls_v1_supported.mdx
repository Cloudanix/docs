### More Info:

The TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol secures transmission of data over the internet using standard encryption technology. Encryption should be set with the latest version of TLS. App Service allows TLS 1.2 by default, which is the recommended TLS level by industry standards, such as PCIDSS.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

SOC2, CISAZURE, CBP, ISO27001

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal: Navigate to portal.azure.com and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. Navigate to App Services: From the left-hand side menu, select "App Services". This will display a list of all the App Services that are currently running in your Azure environment.

3. Select the App Service: Click on the name of the App Service you want to check for unsafe TLS versions. This will open the App Service's dashboard.

4. Check TLS settings: From the App Service's dashboard, select "TLS/SSL settings" under the "Settings" section. Here, you can see the minimum TLS version that is currently set for the App Service. If the minimum TLS version is set to a version lower than 1.2, it means that the App Service supports unsafe TLS versions.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. After installation, open your command prompt or terminal.

2. Login to Azure: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be redirected to the browser for login. Enter your credentials and login.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, select the one where your App Service is located. Replace 'my-subscription-id' with your actual subscription id.
   ```
   az account set --subscription 'my-subscription-id'
   ```
4. Check for Unsafe TLS Version: Use the following command to check the minimum TLS version of your App Service. Replace 'my-resource-group' and 'my-app-service' with your actual resource group and app service names. If the minimum TLS version is less than 1.2, it is considered unsafe.
   ```
   az webapp config show --resource-group 'my-resource-group' --name 'my-app-service' --query minTlsVersion
   ```
   The output will show the minimum TLS version of your App Service. If it is less than 1.2, then it is considered as a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. Install Azure SDK: To interact with Azure services, you need to install Azure SDK in your Python environment. You can do this by running the command `pip install azure`.

2. Import necessary modules: Import the necessary modules in your Python script. You will need the `azure.mgmt.web` module to interact with App Services.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient
```

3. Authenticate and create a client: Use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class from the `azure.identity` module to authenticate your script with Azure. Then, create a `WebSiteManagementClient` object to interact with App Services.

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = "your-subscription-id"  # replace with your Azure subscription ID
client = WebSiteManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

4. Check TLS version: Now, you can use the `client` object to interact with your App Services and check the TLS version. The `min_tls_version` attribute of an App Service tells you the minimum TLS version it supports.

```python
resource_group_name = "your-resource-group"  # replace with your resource group name
app_service_name = "your-app-service"  # replace with your App Service name

app_service = client.web_apps.get(resource_group_name, app_service_name)
if app_service.site_config.min_tls_version < "1.2":
    print(f"Unsafe TLS version supported in App Service: {app_service_name}")
```

This script will print a message if the App Service supports a TLS version less than 1.2, which is considered unsafe. Replace the placeholders with your actual Azure subscription ID, resource group name, and App Service name.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the unsafe TLS version supported misconfiguration in Azure using the Azure console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the resource group that contains the affected resource.
3. Select the affected resource.
4. Click on the "Networking" tab.
5. Under the "Settings" section, click on "SSL/TLS settings".
6. In the "Minimum TLS version" dropdown, select the recommended version (TLS 1.2 or higher).
7. Save the changes by clicking on the "Save" button.

Once the changes are saved, the affected resource will only allow connections using the recommended TLS version (TLS 1.2 or higher), which will ensure that the communication is secure and encrypted.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Unsafe TLS Version Supported" misconfiguration for AZURE using AZURE CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AZURE CLI and login to your AZURE account using the command `az login`.

2. Once you are logged in, run the following command to list all the available App Services in your AZURE account:

   `az webapp list --query "[].{name:name, resourceGroup:resourceGroup}"`

   This command will list all the available App Services in your AZURE account along with their resource group.

3. Choose the App Service for which you want to remediate the "Unsafe TLS Version Supported" misconfiguration and note down its name and resource group.

4. Run the following command to update the TLS version for the chosen App Service:

   `az webapp config set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group> --min-tls-version 1.2`

   Replace `<app-name>` with the name of your chosen App Service and `<resource-group>` with its resource group.

   This command will set the minimum TLS version to 1.2 for the chosen App Service, which is the recommended version for secure communication.

5. Verify that the TLS version has been updated successfully by running the following command:

   `az webapp config show --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group> --query "minTlsVersion"`

   This command will return the minimum TLS version set for the chosen App Service. If it returns "1.2", then the remediation is successful.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Unsafe TLS Version Supported" misconfiguration for an App Service in AZURE using AZURE CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Unsafe TLS Version Supported" misconfiguration in AZURE using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Identify the affected resources
- Use the Azure Security Center to identify the affected resources that have unsafe TLS versions enabled.

Step 2: Update the TLS Version
- Use the Azure Python SDK to update the TLS version for the affected resources.
- Install the Azure Python SDK using the following command: `pip install azure`
- Use the following code to update the TLS version for an App Service:

```python
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

# Set up Azure credentials
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
client_id = 'your-client-id'
secret = 'your-client-secret'
tenant = 'your-tenant-id'
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(client_id=client_id, secret=secret, tenant=tenant)

# Set up the WebSiteManagementClient
web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)

# Update TLS version for the App Service
app_service_name = 'your-app-service-name'
resource_group_name = 'your-resource-group-name'
site_config = web_client.web_apps.get_configuration(resource_group_name, app_service_name)
site_config.min_tls_version = '1.2'
web_client.web_apps.update_configuration(resource_group_name, app_service_name, site_config)
```

Step 3: Verify the remediation
- Use the Azure Security Center to verify that the unsafe TLS versions have been disabled for the affected resources.
- You can also use the Azure Python SDK to verify the TLS version for an App Service:

```python
# Verify TLS version for the App Service
site_config = web_client.web_apps.get_configuration(resource_group_name, app_service_name)
print(site_config.min_tls_version)
```

This should remediate the "Unsafe TLS Version Supported" misconfiguration for Azure using Python.
