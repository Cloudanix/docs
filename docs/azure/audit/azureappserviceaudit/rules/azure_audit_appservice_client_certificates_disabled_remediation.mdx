### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal.

2. Navigate to the App Services section. Here, you will find a list of all your App Services.

3. Select the App Service you want to check for misconfiguration. In the left-hand menu, under the 'Settings' section, click on 'TLS/SSL settings'.

4. In the 'TLS/SSL settings' section, check the 'Client certificate mode' setting. If it is set to 'Ignore' or 'Allow', then client certificates are disabled for that App Service.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI commands, you need to install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website. Once installed, open your command prompt or terminal.

2. Login to Azure: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be redirected to the browser for login. Enter your Azure account credentials.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, select the subscription where the App Service is located. Replace 'my-subscription-id' with your actual subscription id.
   ```
   az account set --subscription 'my-subscription-id'
   ```
4. Check Client Certificates: Use the following command to check if client certificates are disabled in App Service. Replace 'my-resource-group' with your actual resource group name and 'my-app-service' with your actual app service name. If the output is 'false', it means client certificates are disabled.
   ```
   az webapp show --resource-group 'my-resource-group' --name 'my-app-service' --query clientCertEnabled
   ```

#### Using Python

To check if Client Certificates are disabled in Azure App Service using Python scripts, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Azure SDK for Python**: You need to install the Azure SDK for Python in your environment. You can do this using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install azure-mgmt-web
   ```
2. **Set up Azure Credentials**: You need to set up Azure credentials in your environment. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:
   ```bash
   export AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
   export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your-subscription-id
   ```
3. **Create a Python Script**: Create a Python script that uses the Azure SDK to check the client certificates setting for your App Service. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

   subscription_id = os.environ["AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"]  # your Azure Subscription Id
   web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

   resource_group_name = "your-resource-group"  # your resource group name
   name = "your-app-service"  # your app service name

   app_service = web_client.web_apps.get(resource_group_name, name)

   print(f"Client Certificates Enabled: {app_service.client_cert_enabled}")
   ```
4. **Run the Python Script**: Run the Python script. If the output is `False`, then Client Certificates are disabled for your App Service. If the output is `True`, then Client Certificates are enabled.

Please replace "your-tenant-id", "your-client-id", "your-client-secret", "your-subscription-id", "your-resource-group", and "your-app-service" with your actual Azure Tenant ID, Client ID, Client Secret, Subscription ID, Resource Group, and App Service respectively.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Client Certificates Disabled" misconfiguration in Azure using the Azure console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Navigate to the App Service that needs to be remediated.

3. Click on the "TLS/SSL settings" option from the left-hand menu.

4. Scroll down to the "Client certificates" section and ensure that the "Client certificates required" option is set to "On".

5. If the "Client certificates required" option is not set to "On", click on the "Edit" button.

6. In the "Client certificates" section, select the "On" option and then click on the "Save" button.

7. Once the changes are saved, the App Service will now require client certificates to be presented during SSL/TLS negotiation.

8. Verify that the change has been successfully applied by testing the SSL/TLS connection to the App Service using a client certificate.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the "Client Certificates Disabled" misconfiguration in Azure using the Azure console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Client Certificates Disabled" misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI terminal and login to your Azure account.

2. Run the following command to list all the App Service Plans in your subscription:

   ```
   az appservice plan list
   ```

3. Identify the App Service Plan that is affected by the misconfiguration.

4. Run the following command to enable client certificates for the App Service Plan:

   ```
   az appservice plan update --name <app-service-plan-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --set clientCertEnabled=true
   ```

   Replace `<app-service-plan-name>` with the name of the App Service Plan and `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group that contains the App Service Plan.

5. Verify that client certificates are enabled for the App Service Plan by running the following command:

   ```
   az appservice plan show --name <app-service-plan-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --query clientCertEnabled
   ```

   This command should return `true`, indicating that client certificates are now enabled for the App Service Plan.

6. Repeat the above steps for any other affected App Service Plans in your subscription.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the "Client Certificates Disabled" misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Client Certificates Disabled" misconfiguration in Azure using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python. Follow these steps:

1. Install the Azure SDK for Python using pip:

```python
pip install azure-mgmt-web
```

2. Authenticate with Azure using a Service Principal:

```python
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient

# Replace with your own values
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
client_id = 'your-client-id'
secret = 'your-client-secret'
tenant = 'your-tenant-id'

# Create a Service Principal credential
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=client_id,
    secret=secret,
    tenant=tenant
)

# Create a WebSiteManagementClient using the credentials
web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
```

3. Get the App Service Plan resource group and name:

```python
# Replace with your own values
resource_group_name = 'your-resource-group-name'
app_service_plan_name = 'your-app-service-plan-name'

# Get the App Service Plan
app_service_plan = web_client.app_service_plans.get(resource_group_name, app_service_plan_name)
```

4. Enable Client Certificates for the App Service Plan:

```python
# Set the Client Certificates property to True
app_service_plan.client_cert_enabled = True

# Update the App Service Plan
web_client.app_service_plans.create_or_update(resource_group_name, app_service_plan_name, app_service_plan)
```

After running these steps, the "Client Certificates Disabled" misconfiguration should be remediated for the specified App Service Plan in Azure.
