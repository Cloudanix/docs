### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Client Certificates Disabled" misconfiguration in Azure, follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to the App Service that needs to be remediated.
3. Click on the "TLS/SSL settings" option under the "Settings" section on the left-hand side of the screen.
4. Under the "Client Certificates" section, select the "Require" option.
5. Save the changes by clicking on the "Save" button at the top of the screen.

Once these steps are completed, client certificates will be enabled for the App Service, and the misconfiguration will be remediated.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Client Certificates Disabled" misconfiguration in Azure CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI and login to your Azure account.

2. Run the following command to enable client certificates for the Azure App Service:

   ```
   az webapp config set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-service-name> --client-cert-mode Required
   ```

   Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group containing the App Service and `<app-service-name>` with the name of the App Service.

3. Once the command runs successfully, client certificates will be enabled for the App Service.

4. To verify that client certificates are enabled, you can run the following command:

   ```
   az webapp config show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-service-name> --query clientCertEnabled
   ```

   If the output is `true`, then client certificates are enabled for the App Service.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Client Certificates Disabled" misconfiguration in Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of "Client Certificates Disabled" in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Import the necessary AWS SDKs and libraries in Python, such as Boto3.

```
import boto3
```

Step 2: Create a session using AWS credentials.

```
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='REGION'
)
```

Step 3: Create a CloudFront client object using the session.

```
client = session.client('cloudfront')
```

Step 4: Get the distribution configuration using the client object.

```
distribution_config = client.get_distribution_config(Id='DISTRIBUTION_ID')
```

Step 5: Update the distribution configuration to enable client certificates.

```
distribution_config['DistributionConfig']['ViewerCertificate']['CertificateSource'] = 'cloudfront'
distribution_config['DistributionConfig']['ViewerCertificate']['MinimumProtocolVersion'] = 'TLSv1.2_2018'
distribution_config['DistributionConfig']['ViewerCertificate']['CertificateARN'] = 'CERTIFICATE_ARN'
distribution_config['DistributionConfig']['ViewerCertificate']['SSLSupportMethod'] = 'sni-only'
```

Step 6: Update the distribution configuration using the client object.

```
client.update_distribution(
    DistributionConfig=distribution_config['DistributionConfig'],
    Id='DISTRIBUTION_ID',
    IfMatch=distribution_config['ETag']
)
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of "Client Certificates Disabled" in AWS using Python.
