### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to the App Services section. Here, you will see a list of all your App Services.
3. Select the App Service you want to check. This will open the App Service's dashboard.
4. In the left-hand menu, under the 'Settings' section, click on 'Authentication / Authorization'. If the 'App Service Authentication' is set to 'Off', then App Service Authentication is disabled for this App Service.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI commands, you need to have it installed on your system. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website and install it on your system.

2. Login to Azure: Open your command line interface and type the following command to login to your Azure account:

   ```
   az login
   ```
   Follow the prompts in your command line interface to complete the login process.

3. List App Services: Once you are logged in, you can list all the App Services in your account by using the following command:

   ```
   az webapp list --query "[].{name:name, resourceGroup:resourceGroup}"
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the App Services along with their respective resource groups.

4. Check App Service Authentication: Now, for each App Service, you can check if the authentication is enabled or disabled by using the following command:

   ```
   az webapp auth show --name <app_name> --resource-group <resource_group>
   ```
   Replace `<app_name>` and `<resource_group>` with the name and resource group of your App Service respectively. This command will return the authentication settings of the specified App Service. If the "enabled" field in the output is false, it means that the App Service Authentication is disabled.

#### Using Python

1. Install Azure SDK for Python: Azure SDK for Python is a set of libraries that you can use to interact with Azure services. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install azure-mgmt-web
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and authenticate: You need to import the necessary libraries and authenticate to your Azure account. You can use Azure CLI for authentication.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id' # replace with your Azure Subscription id
```

3. Get the list of App Services: You can use the `web_client.web_apps.list_all()` function to get the list of all App Services in your Azure account.

```python
web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
app_services = web_client.web_apps.list_all()
```

4. Check the authentication settings: For each App Service, you can use the `web_client.web_apps.get_auth_settings()` function to get the authentication settings. If the `enabled` property is False, then App Service Authentication is disabled.

```python
for app_service in app_services:
    auth_settings = web_client.web_apps.get_auth_settings(app_service.resource_group, app_service.name)
    if not auth_settings.enabled:
        print(f"App Service Authentication is disabled for {app_service.name}")
```

This script will print the names of all App Services where App Service Authentication is disabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "App Service Authentication Disabled" misconfiguration in AZURE using the AZURE console, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AZURE console and navigate to the App Service that needs to be remediated.
2. Click on the "Authentication/Authorization" option from the left-hand menu.
3. Under the "Authentication Providers" section, select the "Azure Active Directory" option.
4. Select the "Express" option to set up authentication quickly or "Advanced" to configure custom settings.
5. Follow the prompts to configure the authentication settings as per your requirements. You can choose to enable/disable different authentication providers such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Microsoft.
6. Once you have configured the authentication settings, click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "App Service Authentication Disabled" misconfiguration in AZURE using the AZURE console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "App Service Authentication Disabled" misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI on your local machine or in the Azure portal.

2. Login to your Azure account using the command:

   ```
   az login
   ```

3. Select the subscription that contains the affected App Service using the command:

   ```
   az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
   ```

4. Get the resource ID of the affected App Service using the command:

   ```
   az webapp show --name <app_service_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --query id --output tsv
   ```

5. Enable App Service Authentication for the App Service using the command:

   ```
   az webapp auth update --ids <app_service_resource_id> --enabled true
   ```

6. Configure the authentication settings for the App Service. For example, you can configure authentication using Azure Active Directory, Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, or Twitter. Here's an example command to configure authentication using Azure Active Directory:

   ```
   az webapp auth update --ids <app_service_resource_id> --aad-allowed-token-audiences https://<your_aad_app_id>/ --aad-client-id <your_aad_app_id> --aad-client-secret <your_aad_app_secret> --aad-token-issuer-url https://sts.windows.net/<your_aad_tenant_id>/
   ```

   Note: Replace the placeholders `<your_aad_app_id>`, `<your_aad_app_secret>`, and `<your_aad_tenant_id>` with your actual Azure Active Directory application ID, application secret, and tenant ID, respectively.

7. Verify that App Service Authentication is enabled for the App Service using the command:

   ```
   az webapp auth show --ids <app_service_resource_id>
   ```

   This command should return the authentication settings for the App Service.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the "App Service Authentication Disabled" misconfiguration for Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "App Service Authentication Disabled" misconfiguration in Azure using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
```

2. Set up the credentials for accessing the Azure resource:

```
subscription_id = '<subscription_id>'
client_id = '<client_id>'
secret = '<client_secret>'
tenant = '<tenant_id>'

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=client_id,
    secret=secret,
    tenant=tenant
)
```

3. Instantiate the `WebSiteManagementClient`:

```
web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
```

4. Get the list of web apps:

```
web_apps = web_client.web_apps.list()
```

5. For each web app, check if the app service authentication is disabled. If it is disabled, enable it:

```
for web_app in web_apps:
    if not web_app.site_auth_enabled:
        web_client.web_apps.update_site_auth_settings(
            resource_group_name='<resource_group_name>',
            name=web_app.name,
            site_auth_enabled=True
        )
```

6. Replace `<subscription_id>`, `<client_id>`, `<client_secret>`, `<tenant_id>`, and `<resource_group_name>` with the appropriate values.

7. Save the Python script and run it to remediate the misconfiguration.
