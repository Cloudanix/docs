### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the HTTP 2.0 disabled misconfiguration in Azure, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to the App Service that you want to remediate.
3. Click on the "Configuration" tab in the left-hand menu.
4. Scroll down to the "General Settings" section and click on "General Settings".
5. In the "General Settings" section, locate the "HTTP Version" option.
6. Click on the drop-down menu and select "2.0" as the HTTP version.
7. Click on the "Save" button at the top of the page to save the changes.

Once you have completed the above steps, HTTP 2.0 will be enabled for your App Service in Azure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the HTTP 2.0 Disabled misconfiguration in Azure CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI in your terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to list all the available Application Gateway instances in your Azure subscription:
   
   `az network application-gateway list`

3. Identify the Application Gateway instance that has HTTP 2.0 disabled.

4. Run the following command to enable HTTP 2.0 on the identified Application Gateway instance:
   
   `az network application-gateway update --name <ApplicationGatewayName> --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --set http2.enabled=true`

   Replace `<ApplicationGatewayName>` and `<ResourceGroupName>` with the appropriate values.

5. Verify that HTTP 2.0 is enabled on the Application Gateway instance by running the following command:
   
   `az network application-gateway show --name <ApplicationGatewayName> --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --query http2.enabled`

   If the output is `true`, then HTTP 2.0 is enabled on the Application Gateway instance.

6. Repeat the above steps for all the Application Gateway instances in your Azure subscription that have HTTP 2.0 disabled.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the HTTP 2.0 Disabled misconfiguration in Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the HTTP 2.0 disabled misconfiguration in Python, you can use the `http.client.HTTPSConnection` class from the built-in `http.client` module. Here are the steps to enable HTTP 2.0:

1. Create an HTTPS connection object using `http.client.HTTPSConnection`.
```python
import http.client

conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("www.example.com")
```

2. Set the `HTTP2_VERSION` attribute of the connection object to `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2`.
```python
import http.client
import ssl

conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("www.example.com")
conn.HTTPSConnection.HTTP2_VERSION = ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2
```

3. Send an HTTP request using the connection object.
```python
import http.client
import ssl

conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("www.example.com")
conn.HTTPSConnection.HTTP2_VERSION = ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2

conn.request("GET", "/")
response = conn.getresponse()
print(response.read())
```

By setting the `HTTP2_VERSION` attribute to `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2`, you are telling the connection object to use the TLSv1.2 protocol, which supports HTTP 2.0. Sending an HTTP request using the connection object will now use HTTP 2.0.
