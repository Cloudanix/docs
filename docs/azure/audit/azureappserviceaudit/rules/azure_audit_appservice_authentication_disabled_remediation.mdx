### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "App Service Authentication Disabled" misconfiguration in Azure, please follow the below steps:

1. Login to the Azure portal: https://portal.azure.com/
2. Navigate to the App Service that has the misconfiguration.
3. Click on "Authentication / Authorization" under the "Settings" section in the left-hand menu.
4. In the "Authentication / Authorization" section, set "App Service Authentication" to "On".
5. Choose the "Action to take when request is not authenticated" as per your requirement.
6. Under the "Authentication Providers" section, select the appropriate authentication provider(s) and configure them as per your requirement.
7. Click on "Save" to save the changes.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the "App Service Authentication Disabled" misconfiguration in Azure. This will ensure that the App Service is protected by authentication and unauthorized access to the App Service is prevented.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "App Service Authentication Disabled" misconfiguration in Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI command prompt.

2. Log in to your Azure account using the following command:
   
   `az login`

3. Select the Azure subscription that contains the misconfigured App Service using the following command:

   `az account set --subscription <subscription-id>`

4. Enable App Service Authentication for the App Service using the following command:

   `az webapp auth update --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --enabled true`

   Replace `<app-name>` with the name of the App Service that needs to be remediated and `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group that contains the App Service.

5. Verify that App Service Authentication is enabled for the App Service using the following command:

   `az webapp auth show --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>`

   This command should return a JSON object that includes the `"enabled": true` property.

With these steps, you have successfully remediated the "App Service Authentication Disabled" misconfiguration in Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "App Service Authentication Disabled" in Azure using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient
from azure.common.credentials import UserPassCredentials
```

2. Set the credentials for your Azure account:

```python
subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
username = 'your_username'
password = 'your_password'
credentials = UserPassCredentials(username, password)
```

3. Instantiate the WebSiteManagementClient:

```python
web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
```

4. Get the resource group and app service name where the misconfiguration exists:

```python
resource_group_name = 'your_resource_group_name'
app_service_name = 'your_app_service_name'
```

5. Get the current configuration of the app service:

```python
app_service = web_client.web_apps.get(resource_group_name, app_service_name)
```

6. Check if App Service Authentication is disabled:

```python
if not app_service.site_auth_enabled:
    print('App Service Authentication is already disabled.')
else:
    print('App Service Authentication is enabled. Disabling it now...')
```

7. If App Service Authentication is enabled, disable it:

```python
app_service.site_auth_enabled = False
web_client.web_apps.create_or_update(resource_group_name, app_service_name, app_service)
print('App Service Authentication has been disabled.')
```

8. Verify that the misconfiguration has been remediated by checking the configuration of the app service again:

```python
app_service = web_client.web_apps.get(resource_group_name, app_service_name)
if not app_service.site_auth_enabled:
    print('App Service Authentication has been successfully disabled.')
else:
    print('Failed to disable App Service Authentication.')
```

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration "App Service Authentication Disabled" in Azure using Python.
