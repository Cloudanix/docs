### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of App Service not using the latest programming language version in Azure console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to Azure portal and navigate to the App Service that needs to be updated.
2. Go to the "Application settings" blade under the "Settings" section.
3. Look for the "Stack settings" section and check if the "Runtime stack" is set to the latest version of your programming language. If not, update it to the latest version.
4. Save the changes and restart the App Service to apply the updates.

Alternatively, you can also update the programming language version through Azure CLI by running the following command:

```
az webapp config set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-service-name> --linux-fx-version <runtime-stack>
```

Replace `<resource-group-name>`, `<app-service-name>` and `<runtime-stack>` with the appropriate values for your App Service.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of an App Service not using the latest programming language version in Azure CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI command prompt.

2. Log in to your Azure account using the command: `az login`.

3. Once you are logged in, set the subscription context by using the command: `az account set --subscription <subscription_id>`.

4. Next, navigate to the App Service that needs to be updated by using the command: `az webapp show --name <app_service_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name>`.

5. Check the current runtime version of the App Service by running the command: `az webapp config show --name <app_service_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --query linuxFxVersion`.

6. Identify the latest runtime version available for the programming language you are using by visiting the Azure documentation.

7. Update the runtime version of the App Service by using the command: `az webapp config set --name <app_service_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --linux-fx-version <runtime_version>`.

8. Verify that the runtime version has been updated by running the command: `az webapp config show --name <app_service_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --query linuxFxVersion`.

9. Once verified, restart the App Service by using the command: `az webapp restart --name <app_service_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name>`.

By following the above steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration of an App Service not using the latest programming language version in Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

If your App Service is not using the latest Python version, you can remediate this misconfiguration by following the below steps:

1. Log in to your Azure portal and navigate to the App Service that you want to remediate.

2. Click on the "Configuration" tab from the left-hand menu.

3. Scroll down to the "General settings" section and locate the "Python version" setting.

4. Click on the dropdown menu and select the latest version of Python that you want to use.

5. Once you have selected the latest version of Python, click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

6. Restart your App Service to apply the changes by clicking on the "Restart" button under the "Overview" tab.

7. Once the App Service has restarted, verify that the latest version of Python is being used by navigating to the "Development tools" tab and running the "Python --version" command.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration of your App Service not using the latest version of Python.
