### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to the App Services and select the specific App Service you want to check.
3. In the left-hand menu, under the 'Settings' section, click on 'Configuration'.
4. In the 'Configuration' page, click on the 'General settings' tab. Here, check the 'FTP state' setting. If it is set to 'FTP Only' or 'FTP and FTPS', then Plain FTP Deployment is not disabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install Azure CLI: Before you can use Azure CLI commands, you need to have it installed on your system. You can download it from the official Microsoft Azure website and install it on your system.

2. Login to Azure: Use the following command to login to your Azure account. You will be redirected to the browser for login. Enter your credentials to login.
   ```
   az login
   ```
3. Select the Subscription: If you have multiple subscriptions, select the subscription where the App Service is located. Replace 'my-subscription-name' with your subscription name.
   ```
   az account set --subscription 'my-subscription-name'
   ```
4. Check FTP Deployment State: Use the following command to check the FTP deployment state of your App Service. Replace 'my-resource-group' with your resource group name and 'my-app-service' with your App Service name.
   ```
   az webapp config show --resource-group 'my-resource-group' --name 'my-app-service' --query 'ftpsState'
   ```
   If the output is 'AllAllowed' or 'FtpsOnly', then plain FTP deployment is not disabled. If the output is 'Disabled', then plain FTP deployment is disabled.

#### Using Python

1. Install Azure SDK: To interact with Azure services, you need to install Azure SDK in your Python environment. You can do this by running the command `pip install azure`.

2. Import necessary modules: Import the necessary modules in your Python script. You will need the `azure.mgmt.web` module to interact with App Service.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient
```

3. Authenticate and initialize: Authenticate to Azure using the `DefaultAzureCredential` class, which will use your login credentials. Then, initialize the `WebSiteManagementClient` with your subscription ID.

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'  # replace with your Azure subscription ID
web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

4. Check FTP state: Now, you can iterate over all the App Services in your subscription and check the FTP state. If the FTP state is 'AllAllowed' or 'FtpsOnly', then plain FTP is disabled. If it's 'Disabled', then plain FTP is enabled.

```python
for web_app in web_client.web_apps.list():
    site_config = web_client.web_apps.get_configuration(web_app.resource_group, web_app.name)
    if site_config.ftp_state == 'AllAllowed' or site_config.ftp_state == 'FtpsOnly':
        print(f"Plain FTP is disabled for {web_app.name}")
    else:
        print(f"Plain FTP is enabled for {web_app.name}")
```

This script will print out the names of all App Services and whether plain FTP is enabled or disabled for each one.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of disabling plain FTP deployment in AZURE, please follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AZURE portal (https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Select the App Service that you want to remediate.

3. Click on the "Deployment Center" option from the left-hand side menu.

4. Select the "FTP" option under the "Deployment method" section.

5. Click on the "FTP Access" option.

6. In the "FTP Access" window, select the "FTP" option and click on the "Save" button.

7. Now, select the "FTP/S (SSL)" option and click on the "Save" button.

8. Click on the "Save" button in the "Deployment Center" window to save the changes.

9. Now, plain FTP deployment is disabled, and only secure FTP/S (SSL) is enabled for the selected App Service.

Note: It is recommended to use secure FTP/S (SSL) for deployment to ensure that the data is encrypted during transmission.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of disabling plain FTP deployment in Azure using Azure CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open Azure CLI and login to your Azure account using the command:

```
az login
```

Step 2: Once you have logged in, you need to select the subscription that contains the App Service where you want to disable plain FTP deployment using the command:

```
az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
```

Replace the `<subscription-id>` with the actual ID of your subscription.

Step 3: Next, you need to set the configuration of your App Service to disable plain FTP deployment. To do this, use the following command:

```
az webapp config set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --ftps-state Disabled
```

Replace `<app-name>` with the name of your App Service and `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group where your App Service is located.

Step 4: Finally, verify that plain FTP deployment has been disabled by running the following command:

```
az webapp config show --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --query ftpsState
```

This command will return the current state of the FTPS (FTP over SSL) deployment for your App Service. If it returns "Disabled", then plain FTP deployment has been successfully disabled.

That's it! You have now remediated the misconfiguration of disabling plain FTP deployment in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of disabling plain FTP deployment in Azure using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Connect to the Azure Subscription using the Azure Python SDK.
```
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.web import WebSiteManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.web.models import SiteConfig, FtpsState

# Tenant ID for Azure Subscription
TENANT_ID = '<your tenant id>'

# Client ID (Application ID) for Azure Subscription
CLIENT_ID = '<your client id>'

# Client Secret for Azure Subscription
CLIENT_SECRET = '<your client secret>'

# Subscription ID for Azure Subscription
SUBSCRIPTION_ID = '<your subscription id>'

# Resource Group Name for the Web App
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME = '<your resource group name>'

# Name of the Web App
WEB_APP_NAME = '<your web app name>'

# Create a Service Principal Credential object
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id=CLIENT_ID,
    secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
    tenant=TENANT_ID
)

# Create a Resource Management Client object
resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(
    credentials,
    SUBSCRIPTION_ID
)

# Create a WebSite Management Client object
web_client = WebSiteManagementClient(
    credentials,
    SUBSCRIPTION_ID
)

# Get the Web App Configuration
web_app_config = web_client.web_apps.get_configuration(
    RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME,
    WEB_APP_NAME
)

# Get the current Ftps State
ftps_state = web_app_config.ftps_state

# Check if the Ftps State is not set to FtpsOnly
if ftps_state != FtpsState.FtpsOnly:
    # Set the Ftps State to FtpsOnly
    web_app_config.ftps_state = FtpsState.FtpsOnly

    # Update the Web App Configuration
    web_client.web_apps.update_configuration(
        RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME,
        WEB_APP_NAME,
        web_app_config
    )
```

2. Replace the `TENANT_ID`, `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`, and `WEB_APP_NAME` variables with your own values.

3. Run the script to disable plain FTP deployment in Azure for the specified Web App.
