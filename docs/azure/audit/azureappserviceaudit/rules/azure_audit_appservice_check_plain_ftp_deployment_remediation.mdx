### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Disable Plain FTP Deployment" misconfiguration in Azure, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Azure Portal and navigate to the App Service that you want to remediate.

2. Click on the "Deployment Center" option from the left-hand side menu.

3. Under the "Deployment Center", select the "FTP" option.

4. Scroll down to the "FTP Access" section and toggle the "FTP/FTPS State" option to "FTPS Only".

5. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

6. Once the changes are saved, you have successfully remediated the "Disable Plain FTP Deployment" misconfiguration in Azure.

Note: By enabling FTPS, you are ensuring that all file transfers are encrypted and secure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of disabling plain FTP deployment in Azure using Azure CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure CLI and log in to your Azure account using the command `az login`.

2. Once you are logged in, you need to identify the App Service where you want to disable plain FTP deployment. You can do this by running the command `az webapp list`.

3. After identifying the App Service, run the following command to disable plain FTP deployment:

   ```
   az webapp config set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --ftps-state Disabled
   ```

   Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group where your App Service is located, and `<app-name>` with the name of your App Service.

4. Once you run the command, Azure CLI will disable plain FTP deployment for your App Service.

   Note: You can also enable or disable FTP deployment using the Azure portal or Azure PowerShell.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of disabling plain FTP deployment in Azure using Azure CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of disabling plain FTP deployment in all three clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP) using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. AWS: 
   - Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.
   - Select the instance(s) for which you want to disable plain FTP deployment.
   - Click on the "Security Groups" tab and select the security group(s) associated with the instance(s).
   - Edit the inbound rules of the security group(s) to remove the FTP rule.
   - Alternatively, you can create a new security group with inbound rules that do not allow FTP traffic and associate it with the instance(s).

   Python Code:

   ```
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
   security_group_id = 'sg-1234567890'
   security_group = ec2.SecurityGroup(security_group_id)

   # Remove the FTP rule from the inbound rules of the security group
   security_group.revoke_ingress(
       IpProtocol='tcp',
       FromPort=21,
       ToPort=21,
       CidrIp='0.0.0.0/0'
   )
   ```

2. Azure: 
   - Open the Azure portal and navigate to the Virtual Machine(s) for which you want to disable plain FTP deployment.
   - Click on the "Networking" tab and select the network interface(s) associated with the Virtual Machine(s).
   - Edit the inbound security rules of the network interface(s) to remove the FTP rule.
   - Alternatively, you can create a new network security group with inbound security rules that do not allow FTP traffic and associate it with the Virtual Machine(s).

   Python Code:

   ```
   from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
   from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

   subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
   credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
       client_id='your_client_id',
       secret='your_secret',
       tenant='your_tenant'
   )
   network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)

   resource_group_name = 'your_resource_group_name'
   network_interface_name = 'your_network_interface_name'

   # Remove the FTP rule from the inbound security rules of the network interface
   network_security_group = network_client.network_security_groups.get(
       resource_group_name,
       'your_network_security_group_name'
   )
   network_security_group.security_rules = [rule for rule in network_security_group.security_rules if rule.destination_port_range != '21']
   network_client.network_security_groups.create_or_update(resource_group_name, network_security_group.name, network_security_group)
   ```

3. GCP: 
   - Open the GCP console and navigate to the Compute Engine(s) for which you want to disable plain FTP deployment.
   - Click on the "Firewall" tab and select the firewall rule(s) associated with the Compute Engine(s).
   - Edit the firewall rule(s) to remove the FTP rule.
   - Alternatively, you can create a new firewall rule with inbound rules that do not allow FTP traffic and associate it with the Compute Engine(s).

   Python Code:

   ```
   from google.oauth2 import service_account
   from googleapiclient.discovery import build

   credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
       'your_service_account_key_file.json'
   )
   compute = build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)

   project = 'your_project_id'
   firewall_name = 'your_firewall_name'

   # Remove the FTP rule from the firewall rule(s)
   firewall = compute.firewalls().get(project=project, firewall=firewall_name).execute()
   firewall['allowed'] = [rule for rule in firewall['allowed'] if rule['IPProtocol'] != 'tcp' or rule['ports'] != ['21']]
   compute.firewalls().update(project=project, firewall=firewall_name, body=firewall).execute()
   ```

Note: The above Python code snippets are just examples and may need to be modified based on your specific use case. Also, you need to have the necessary permissions and credentials to perform these actions in the respective cloud environments.
