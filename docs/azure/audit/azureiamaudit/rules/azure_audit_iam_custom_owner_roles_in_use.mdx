7. Determine if the custom role is necessary for the user or group to perform their job duties.
8. If the custom role is not necessary, remove the role assignment.
9. If the custom role is necessary, modify the permissions of the role to reduce the level of access granted.
10. Repeat steps 6-9 for each custom role that is assigned to users or groups with owner-level permissions.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the "Custom Owner Roles In Use" misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI, follow the steps below:

1. Open the Azure CLI command prompt or terminal.
2. Run the following command to list all the custom owner roles in use:

   ```
   az role assignment list --all --include-classic-administrators --query "[?roleDefinitionName=='Owner']"
   ```

   This command lists all the custom owner roles in use in your Azure subscription.

3. Review the output of the above command and identify the custom owner roles that are not required or are no longer in use.

4. Run the following command to delete the custom owner role:

   ```
   az role assignment delete --assignee <object-id> --role <role-name>
   ```

   Replace `<object-id>` with the object ID of the user or group to whom the custom owner role is assigned, and `<role-name>` with the name of the custom owner role.

5. Repeat step 4 for all the custom owner roles that are not required or are no longer in use.

6. Run the following command to verify that the custom owner roles have been deleted:

   ```
   az role assignment list --all --include-classic-administrators --query "[?roleDefinitionName=='Owner']"
   ```

   This command should not list any custom owner roles.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the "Custom Owner Roles In Use" misconfiguration in Azure using Azure CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Custom Owner Roles In Use" in Azure using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Connect to Azure using Python SDK
```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
client = ResourceManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

Step 2: Get the list of resource groups
```python
resource_groups = client.resource_groups.list()
```

Step 3: For each resource group, check if custom owner roles are assigned
```python
for rg in resource_groups:
    roles = client.role_assignments.list_for_resource_group(rg.name)
    for role in roles:
        if role.role_definition_name == 'Owner' and role.scope == rg.id:
            print(f"Custom Owner role assigned in Resource Group {rg.name}")
```

Step 4: Remove the custom owner role assignments
```python
for rg in resource_groups:
    roles = client.role_assignments.list_for_resource_group(rg.name)
    for role in roles:
        if role.role_definition_name == 'Owner' and role.scope == rg.id:
            client.role_assignments.delete(role.scope, role.name)
            print(f"Custom Owner role removed from Resource Group {rg.name}")
```

Note: Before running the script, make sure to authenticate with Azure using the appropriate credentials and provide the necessary permissions to the service principal or user account. Also, test the script in a non-production environment before running it in a production environment.
