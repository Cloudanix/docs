## Resources which determine your pricing

Azure offers several services. Cloudanix monitors many of these services. However, we do not consider all of them to determine your Cloudanix pricing. Infact, we only use a subset of these services to generate your Cloudanix invoice.

The below table lists all the Azure services which makes up your Cloudanix invoice.

| Resource Name                | Unit         | Notes                         |

## How do we count your resources?

We continuously monitor the resources and record the max during the month. At the end of the month, your invoice will be generated accordingly.

## Additional FAQ

There is an FAQ available on the [Pricing Page](https://www.cloudanix.com/pricing?ref=azure-resources-for-pricing) which answer the popular pricing related questions. Below FAQ covers Azure specific queries.

### What about other resources like Networks, queues etc?

We monitor them but we do not use them towards your pricing. They are free.
