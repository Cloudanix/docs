### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Org MFA required" misconfiguration in the Github console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to your Github account and navigate to the organization you want to remediate the misconfiguration for.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab on the top right corner of the page.
3. From the left-hand side menu, select "Security & analysis".
4. Scroll down to the "Authentication" section and click on the "Require two-factor authentication" option.
5. Enable the "Require two-factor authentication" toggle button and select the "All members" option from the drop-down menu.
6. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

This will remediate the "Org MFA required" misconfiguration by requiring all members of the organization to enable two-factor authentication for their Github accounts.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Org MFA required" in GITHUB CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the GitHub CLI and log in to your GitHub account.
2. Navigate to the organization where you want to enable MFA.
3. Click on the "Settings" tab and select "Security & analysis".
4. Under "Security & analysis", click on "Require two-factor authentication".
5. Select the "Require two-factor authentication for all members" option.
6. Click on "Save" to enable MFA for all members of the organization.

Note: If you are not an owner or administrator of the organization, you will not be able to enable MFA for the organization. In that case, you should contact the owner or administrator of the organization and ask them to enable MFA.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Org MFA required" misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can use the following steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using pip:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Create a new IAM policy that requires MFA for all users in the organization. You can use the following policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "RequireMFAForAllUsers",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "BoolIfExists": {
                    "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "false"
                },
                "ForAllValues:StringLikeIfExists": {
                    "aws:PrincipalARN": [
                        "arn:aws:iam::*:user/${aws:username}",
                        "arn:aws:iam::*:root"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This policy denies all actions for all resources if the user does not have MFA enabled. It applies to all users in the organization, including the root account.

3. Create a new IAM role that can be assumed by an administrator. This role should have the new policy attached to it.

```
import boto3

iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

response = iam_client.create_role(
    RoleName='MFARequiredRole',
    AssumeRolePolicyDocument='{"Version": "2012-10-17","Statement": [{"Effect": "Allow","Principal": {"Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"},"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"}]}'
)

response = iam_client.attach_role_policy(
    RoleName='MFARequiredRole',
    PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess'
)

response = iam_client.put_role_policy(
    RoleName='MFARequiredRole',
    PolicyName='RequireMFAPolicy',
    PolicyDocument='{"Version": "2012-10-17","Statement": [{"Sid": "RequireMFAForAllUsers","Effect": "Deny","Action": "*","Resource": "*","Condition": {"BoolIfExists": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "false"},"ForAllValues:StringLikeIfExists": {"aws:PrincipalARN": ["arn:aws:iam::*:user/${aws:username}","arn:aws:iam::*:root"]}}}]}}'
)
```

This code creates a new IAM role called "MFARequiredRole", attaches the AdministratorAccess policy to it, and adds the new policy that requires MFA for all users in the organization.

4. Assign the new role to an administrator user.

```
response = iam_client.create_instance_profile(
    InstanceProfileName='MFARequiredProfile'
)

response = iam_client.add_role_to_instance_profile(
    InstanceProfileName='MFARequiredProfile',
    RoleName='MFARequiredRole'
)

response = iam_client.update_assume_role_policy(
    RoleName='MFARequiredRole',
    PolicyDocument='{"Version": "2012-10-17","Statement": [{"Effect": "Allow","Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::*:user/admin"},"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"}]}'
)
```

This code creates a new instance profile called "MFARequiredProfile", adds the new role to it, and updates the assume role policy to allow an administrator user to assume the new role.

5. Test the new configuration by logging in as a user without MFA enabled. You should receive an error message indicating that MFA is required.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Org MFA required" misconfiguration in AWS using Python.
