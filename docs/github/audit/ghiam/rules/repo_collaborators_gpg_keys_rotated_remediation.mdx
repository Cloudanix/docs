### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the GPG Keys rotation misconfiguration in GitHub console, please follow these steps:

1. Generate a new GPG key pair: 
   - Open the command prompt or terminal on your local machine.
   - Run the command `gpg --full-generate-key` to generate a new key pair.
   - Follow the prompts to enter your name, email address, and passphrase.

2. Export the new public key: 
   - Run the command `gpg --armor --export <your email address>` to export the public key.
   - Copy the output of the command.

3. Add the new public key to GitHub: 
   - Log in to your GitHub account.
   - Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner of the page and select "Settings".
   - Click on "SSH and GPG keys" in the left-hand menu.
   - Click on the "New GPG key" button.
   - Paste the copied public key into the "Key" field.
   - Click on the "Add GPG key" button.

4. Revoke the old public key: 
   - Run the command `gpg --list-keys` to list all the GPG keys on your local machine.
   - Find the ID of the old public key in the output of the command.
   - Run the command `gpg --edit-key <old public key ID>` to edit the key.
   - Run the command `revuid` to revoke the key.
   - Follow the prompts to confirm the revocation.

5. Update your commits with the new key: 
   - Run the command `git log --show-signature` to list all the commits with GPG signatures.
   - Find the SHA of the commit that was signed with the old key.
   - Run the command `git rebase -i <SHA of the commit>` to open the interactive rebase tool.
   - Replace "pick" with "edit" for the commit that was signed with the old key.
   - Save and close the file.
   - Run the command `git commit --amend --no-edit -S` to sign the commit with the new key.
   - Run the command `git rebase --continue` to continue the rebase process.

6. Push the changes to GitHub: 
   - Run the command `git push --force-with-lease` to push the changes to GitHub.

After following these steps, your GPG keys will be rotated and your commits will be signed with the new key.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the GPG Keys rotation misconfiguration in GitHub CLI, follow these steps:

1. Generate a new GPG key pair by running the following command in your terminal: 

   ```
   gpg --full-generate-key
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to enter your name, email address, and passphrase for the new key pair.

3. Export the public key by running the following command:

   ```
   gpg --armor --export <email address>
   ```

   Replace `<email address>` with the email address you used to generate the new key pair.

4. Copy the output of the previous command to your clipboard.

5. In GitHub CLI, navigate to your account settings and click on "SSH and GPG keys".

6. Click on the "New GPG key" button.

7. Paste the public key you copied earlier into the "Key" field.

8. Click on "Add GPG key" to save the new key to your GitHub account.

9. Finally, update any repositories that were using the old GPG key by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   git config --global user.signingkey <new key ID>
   ```

   Replace `<new key ID>` with the ID of the new GPG key, which you can find by running the following command:

   ```
   gpg --list-keys
   ```

   Look for the line that starts with "pub" and copy the 8-character key ID that follows.

That's it! You have now remediated the GPG Keys rotation misconfiguration in GitHub CLI.

#### Using Python

The remediation steps for GPG Keys rotation in Python are as follows:

1. Import the required libraries: You will need the following libraries to perform GPG key rotation in Python:

   ```
   import gnupg
   import os
   ```

2. Instantiate the GPG object: Create an instance of the gnupg.GPG class.

   ```
   gpg = gnupg.GPG()
   ```

3. List the existing keys: Use the `list_keys()` method to get a list of the existing keys.

   ```
   keys = gpg.list_keys()
   ```

4. Delete the expired keys: Iterate over the keys list and delete the expired keys.

   ```
   for key in keys:
       if 'expired' in key['subkeys'][0]['expires']:
           gpg.delete_keys(key['fingerprint'], True)
   ```

5. Generate new keys: Use the `gen_key_input()` method to generate new keys.

   ```
   input_data = gpg.gen_key_input(key_type='RSA', key_length=2048, passphrase='my passphrase')
   key = gpg.gen_key(input_data)
   ```

6. Export the public key: Use the `export_keys()` method to export the public key.

   ```
   public_key = gpg.export_keys(key.fingerprint)
   ```

7. Export the private key: Use the `export_keys()` method to export the private key.

   ```
   private_key = gpg.export_keys(key.fingerprint, True, passphrase='my passphrase')
   ```

8. Save the keys to files: Save the public and private keys to separate files.

   ```
   with open('public.key', 'w') as f:
       f.write(public_key)

   with open('private.key', 'w') as f:
       f.write(private_key)
   ```

9. Remove the old keys: Use the `delete_keys()` method to remove the old keys from the keyring.

   ```
   for key in keys:
       if 'expired' in key['subkeys'][0]['expires']:
           gpg.delete_keys(key['fingerprint'], True)
   ```

10. Verify the new keys: Use the `verify_keys()` method to verify the new keys.

   ```
   gpg.verify_keys(public_key)
   gpg.verify_keys(private_key)
   ```

11. Clean up: Remove the temporary files.

   ```
   os.remove('public.key')
   os.remove('private.key')
   ```

These steps will remediate the GPG key rotation misconfiguration using Python.
