### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Repo Deployment Keys Rotated" misconfiguration in the GitHub console, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository that is affected by the misconfiguration.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab located on the right side of the repository page.
3. From the left-hand menu, select "Deploy keys".
4. Locate the affected key and click on the "Edit" button next to it.
5. Generate a new key by clicking on the "Generate Key" button.
6. Copy the new key and paste it into the "Key" field.
7. Add a descriptive title in the "Title" field to identify the new key.
8. Click on the "Update Key" button to save the changes.
9. Remove the old key by clicking on the "Delete" button next to it.
10. Confirm the deletion by clicking on the "Delete" button in the pop-up window.

By following these steps, you will have successfully remediated the "Repo Deployment Keys Rotated" misconfiguration in the GitHub console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of rotated deployment keys in GitHub CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Generate a new deployment key
- Open the repository in GitHub and go to the "Settings" tab.
- Click on the "Deploy keys" option and then click on the "Add deploy key" button.
- Give a suitable name to the new deployment key and check the "Allow write access" option if needed.
- Copy the generated key to your clipboard.

Step 2: Remove the old deployment key
- In the GitHub CLI, navigate to the local repository where the misconfiguration occurred.
- Run the command "git remote -v" to see the current remote repository URL.
- Run the command "git remote set-url --delete --push origin [repository URL]" to remove the old deployment key from the remote repository.

Step 3: Add the new deployment key
- Run the command "git remote set-url --add --push origin [repository URL]" to add the new deployment key to the remote repository.

Step 4: Verify the deployment key
- Run the command "ssh -T git@github.com" to verify that the new deployment key is working properly.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of rotated deployment keys in GitHub CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of rotated deployment keys in a Git repository, you can use Python to automate the process. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Install the PyGithub library using pip:

   ```
   pip install PyGithub
   ```

2. Authenticate with the GitHub API using a personal access token or OAuth token. You can create a personal access token in your GitHub account settings.

   ```
   from github import Github
   g = Github("<your-personal-access-token>")
   ```

3. Get a list of all repositories in your GitHub account:

   ```
   repos = g.get_user().get_repos()
   ```

4. Loop through each repository and check if it has any deployment keys that have been rotated:

   ```
   for repo in repos:
       keys = repo.get_keys()
       for key in keys:
           if key.get_verification() is not None and key.get_verification().get_reason() == "key was rotated":
               # Do something to remediate the misconfiguration
               # For example, you could delete the old key and create a new one
               key.delete()
               repo.create_key("New Deployment Key", "<your-public-key>")
   ```

5. Save the Python script and run it to remediate the misconfiguration in all your repositories.

Note: This code example is specific to GitHub, but similar libraries exist for other Git hosting platforms like GitLab and Bitbucket. The general approach would be similar, but the specific API calls may differ.
