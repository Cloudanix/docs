### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of user email being public in GitHub console, please follow the below steps:

1. Login to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository where the misconfiguration exists.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab on the right side of the repository page.
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Emails".
4. Under the "Keep my email addresses private" section, select the checkbox for "Block command line pushes that expose my email".
5. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page.

This will prevent any future commits from exposing your email address. However, if you have already made commits with your email address exposed, you will need to follow these additional steps:

1. Open a terminal on your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the following command to set your email address to be private:
   `git config --global user.email "email@example.com"`
4. Run the following command to update your commit history with the new email address:
   `git filter-branch --commit-filter 'if [ "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" = "email@example.com" ]; then GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=""; GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=""; fi; git commit-tree "$@"' HEAD`
5. Push the updated commit history to the remote repository:
   `git push --force`

This will update your commit history with the new private email address and prevent any future email exposures.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of exposing user email in Github CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Github CLI and log in to your account.
2. Type the command `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"` to set your email address. Make sure to replace "you@example.com" with your actual email address.
3. Type the command `git config --global --unset-all user.email` to remove any previously set email addresses. This ensures that your email address is not accidentally exposed.
4. Type the command `git config --global core.sshCommand "ssh -o 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no' -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa"` to configure SSH to ignore strict host key checking.
5. Finally, type the command `git config --global --list` to verify that your email address is not displayed in the output.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of exposing user email in Github CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of user email being public, you can use the following steps in Python:

1. Identify the location where user email is stored. This could vary depending on the cloud provider and the service being used.

2. Use the appropriate API or SDK provided by the cloud provider to update the user email to private. For example, in AWS, you can use the `update_user_attributes` method of the CognitoIdentityProvider client to update the email attribute of a user.

3. Write a Python script to automate the remediation process. Here's an example script that uses the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update the email attribute of a user:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the CognitoIdentityProvider client
client = boto3.client('cognito-idp')

# Set the user pool ID and user email
user_pool_id = 'your-user-pool-id'
user_email = 'user-email@example.com'

# Update the email attribute of the user
response = client.admin_update_user_attributes(
    UserPoolId=user_pool_id,
    Username=user_email,
    UserAttributes=[
        {
            'Name': 'email_verified',
            'Value': 'true'
        },
        {
            'Name': 'email',
            'Value': 'private'
        }
    ]
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

4. Schedule the script to run periodically to ensure that any new users are also updated to have private email addresses.

Note: The above script is specific to AWS CognitoIdentityProvider client, and it may vary depending on the cloud provider and service being used.
