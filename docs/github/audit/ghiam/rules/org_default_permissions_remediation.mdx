### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Org Default Permissions" misconfiguration in the GitHub console, please follow the below steps:

Step 1: Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to your organization's settings.

Step 2: Click on the "Member privileges" tab in the left sidebar.

Step 3: Scroll down to the "Default member permissions" section and click on the "Edit" button next to it.

Step 4: In the "Default member permissions" modal window, set the default permission level for your organization's members to "Read" or "Write" depending on your organization's security requirements.

Step 5: Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Step 6: Review your organization's member list to ensure that all members have the appropriate permissions.

Step 7: If any members have permissions that are too high, adjust their permissions by clicking on their name in the member list, then clicking on the "Edit" button next to their name.

Step 8: In the "Member privileges" modal window, adjust the member's permissions to the appropriate level.

Step 9: Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Step 10: Repeat steps 7-9 for any other members who have permissions that are too high.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Org Default Permissions" misconfiguration in the GitHub console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate "Org Default Permissions" misconfiguration in GitHub CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and login to your GitHub account using the command `gh auth login`.
2. Once you are authenticated, use the command `gh api /orgs/{org}/settings/member_privacy` to check the current default permission level for new organization members.
3. If the default permission level is set to "None", use the command `gh api -X PATCH /orgs/{org}/settings/member_privacy -F members_can_create_repositories=true` to update the default permission level to "Read".
4. If the default permission level is already set to "Read", use the command `gh api -X PATCH /orgs/{org}/settings/member_privacy -F members_can_create_repositories=true -F members_can_create_internal_repositories=true` to update the default permission level to "Write".
5. Verify the changes using the command `gh api /orgs/{org}/settings/member_privacy`.

Note: Replace {org} with your organization name in the above commands.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Org Default Permissions" misconfiguration in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to set up the AWS CLI and configure your credentials.

2. Install the boto3 library using pip.

3. Use the following Python code to remediate the misconfiguration:

```python
import boto3

# Create an IAM client
iam = boto3.client('iam')

# Get the current organization's policy
org_policy = iam.get_policy(PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSControlTowerExecution')

# Get the policy version
policy_version = iam.get_policy_version(PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSControlTowerExecution',
                                         VersionId=org_policy['Policy']['DefaultVersionId'])

# Get the policy document
policy_doc = policy_version['PolicyVersion']['Document']

# Remove the default permissions from the policy document
for statement in policy_doc['Statement']:
    if statement['Effect'] == 'Allow' and 'aws:PrincipalOrgID' in statement['Condition']:
        policy_doc['Statement'].remove(statement)

# Create a new policy version with the updated policy document
new_policy_version = iam.create_policy_version(PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSControlTowerExecution',
                                               PolicyDocument=policy_doc,
                                               SetAsDefault=True)

# Delete the old policy version
iam.delete_policy_version(PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSControlTowerExecution',
                          VersionId=policy_version['PolicyVersion']['VersionId'])
```

This code will remove the default permissions from the AWSControlTowerExecution policy, which is the default policy for AWS Control Tower. It does this by retrieving the policy document, removing any statements that allow access based on the aws:PrincipalOrgID condition, creating a new policy version with the updated document, and deleting the old policy version.
