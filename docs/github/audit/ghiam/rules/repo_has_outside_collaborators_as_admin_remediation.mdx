### Remediation

#### Using Console

The misconfiguration of having an outside collaborator as an admin in GitHub can be remediated by following these steps:

1. Login to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository where the outside collaborator has admin access.

2. Click on the "Settings" tab on the right-hand side of the repository.

3. Under the "Settings" tab, click on the "Collaborators & teams" option.

4. Find the outside collaborator's name in the list of collaborators and click on the "Remove" button next to their name.

5. Confirm that you want to remove the collaborator by clicking on the "Remove" button in the pop-up window.

6. Once the collaborator has been removed, you can then re-add them to the repository with the appropriate access level (non-admin).

7. Click on the "Invite a collaborator" button and enter the outside collaborator's GitHub username or email address.

8. Select the appropriate access level for the collaborator (e.g. "Read" or "Write" access).

9. Click on the "Add collaborator" button to send the invitation to the outside collaborator.

10. Once the outside collaborator accepts the invitation, they will have the appropriate access level to the repository without being an admin.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of having an outside collaborator as an admin in GitHub.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of an outside collaborator having admin access in GitHub CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the command prompt and run the command "gh auth login" to authenticate yourself with GitHub.

2. Run the command "gh repo list" to list all the repositories in your GitHub account.

3. Choose the repository for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

4. Run the command "gh repo collaborator remove [repository name] [collaborator name]" to remove the collaborator's admin access.

5. If you want to add the collaborator back to the repository with read-only access, run the command "gh repo collaborator add [repository name] [collaborator name] --permission read" 

6. Verify that the collaborator's access has been changed by running the command "gh repo collaborator list [repository name]".

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of an outside collaborator having admin access in GitHub CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of an outside collaborator having admin access to a cloud environment, you can use the following steps in Python:

1. Authenticate to the cloud provider's API using the appropriate credentials.
2. Retrieve a list of all outside collaborators.
3. For each outside collaborator, check if they have admin access.
4. If an outside collaborator has admin access, remove their admin privileges.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all outside collaborators with admin access.

Here's an example Python code snippet that demonstrates how to remediate the misconfiguration of an outside collaborator having admin access in AWS:

```python
import boto3

# Authenticate to AWS API
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='REGION_NAME'
)

# Retrieve a list of all outside collaborators
iam = session.client('iam')
response = iam.list_users()

# Check if each outside collaborator has admin access
for user in response['Users']:
    username = user['UserName']
    response = iam.list_attached_user_policies(
        UserName=username
    )
    for policy in response['AttachedPolicies']:
        if policy['PolicyName'] == 'AdministratorAccess':
            # Remove admin privileges from outside collaborator
            iam.detach_user_policy(
                UserName=username,
                PolicyArn=policy['PolicyArn']
            )
            print(f'Removed admin access from {username}')
```

Note: This code is only an example and may need to be modified to fit your specific use case. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the appropriate permissions are granted to the user running this code to avoid any unintended consequences.
