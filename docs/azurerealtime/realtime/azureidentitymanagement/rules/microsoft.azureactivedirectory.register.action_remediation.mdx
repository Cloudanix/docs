### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory.register.action event in AzureRealTime for AzureIdentityManagement refers to an event that is triggered when a user or application registers a new Azure Active Directory (AAD) application.
- This event indicates that a new application has been registered in the Azure AD tenant, and it provides information about the application's properties, such as its display name, application ID, and the user or application that registered it.
- This event is useful for monitoring and auditing purposes, as it allows administrators to track the creation of new applications in the Azure AD tenant and ensure that proper governance and security measures are in place.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory.register.action event is triggered in Azure Real-time for Azure Identity Management, it could indicate that a user or application is attempting to register a new Azure Active Directory (AAD) application. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation if the registration is malicious or not properly controlled.

Remediation:
- Monitor and review the Azure AD audit logs to identify any unauthorized or suspicious application registrations.
- Implement conditional access policies to restrict the ability to register new applications to trusted users or groups.
- Regularly review and revoke unnecessary or unused application registrations using the Azure AD PowerShell module. For example, you can use the following Azure CLI command to list all registered applications:

```
az ad app list --query "[].{displayName:displayName, appId:appId}"
```

2. Example of security impact: The Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory.register.action event in Azure Real-time for Azure Identity Management could also indicate an attempt to register an application with excessive permissions or with malicious intent. This could result in unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources within the Azure environment.

Remediation:
- Implement Azure AD application registration approval workflows to ensure that all new application registrations are reviewed and approved by appropriate stakeholders.
- Regularly review and update the permissions assigned to registered applications to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.
- Utilize Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enforce just-in-time access for privileged roles and regularly review and revoke unnecessary permissions.

3. Example of security impact: The Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory.register.action event in Azure Real-time for Azure Identity Management could also indicate an attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) or other security controls by registering a rogue application. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources within the Azure environment.

Remediation:
- Enforce MFA for all users and service principals within the Azure AD tenant.
- Implement Azure AD Conditional Access policies to block or require additional authentication factors for application registrations originating from suspicious or untrusted locations.
- Regularly review and monitor Azure AD sign-in logs for any suspicious activity related to application registrations.
