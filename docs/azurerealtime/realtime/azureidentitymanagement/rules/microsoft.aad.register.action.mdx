### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.AAD.register.action event in AzureRealTime for AzureIdentityManagement refers to an action related to the registration of an Azure Active Directory (AAD) application.
- This event indicates that a specific action has been performed on an AAD application, such as registering a new application or updating the registration settings of an existing application.
- It is important to monitor this event as it provides insights into the management and configuration of AAD applications, which are crucial for controlling access and permissions within an Azure environment.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: The Microsoft.AAD.register.action event in AzureIdentityManagement can potentially impact security if it is triggered by an unauthorized user attempting to register a new application or service principal in Azure Active Directory (AAD). This could lead to the creation of rogue applications with elevated permissions, which can be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or unauthorized access to resources.

Remediation:
- Monitor Azure AD sign-in logs and audit logs to identify any suspicious registration activities.
- Implement conditional access policies to restrict application registrations to trusted sources or specific IP ranges.
- Regularly review and revoke unnecessary or unused application registrations.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users to prevent unauthorized access to Azure AD.

Azure CLI command to monitor Azure AD sign-in logs:
```
az monitor activity-log list --resource-type Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory/registerApplications --query "[?operationName.value=='Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory/registerApplications/write']"
```

Azure CLI command to list all registered applications:
```
az ad app list --query "[].{AppId: appId, DisplayName: displayName, Owners: ownerDisplayName}"
```

2. Example of security impact: The Microsoft.AAD.register.action event in AzureIdentityManagement can also impact security if it is triggered by a misconfiguration or vulnerability in an existing application registration. This could allow an attacker to exploit the application and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and update the permissions and roles assigned to application registrations.
- Implement Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enforce just-in-time access for application registrations.
- Enable Azure AD Conditional Access policies to enforce additional security controls for application access.
- Regularly scan and patch applications for known vulnerabilities.

Azure CLI command to enable Azure AD PIM for application registrations:
```
az ad pim update --id <application_registration_id> --add "roleName=Application Administrator"
```

Azure CLI command to enable Conditional Access policies for application access:
```
az ad app update --id <application_id> --set oauth2Permissions.additionalProperties.authorizationPolicy="RequireMFA"
```

3. Example of security impact: The Microsoft.AAD.register.action event in AzureIdentityManagement can also impact security if it is triggered by a compromised user account. An attacker with access to a user account can register a malicious application and use it to gain unauthorized access to resources or perform malicious actions.

Remediation:
- Implement strong password policies and enforce regular password changes.
- Enable Azure AD Identity Protection to detect and prevent account compromise.
- Enable Azure AD Conditional Access policies to enforce additional security controls for user authentication.
- Regularly review and revoke unnecessary or unused user accounts.

Azure CLI command to enable Azure AD Identity Protection:
```
az ad identity-protection update --enabled true
```

Azure CLI command to enable Conditional Access policies for user authentication:
```
az ad user update --id <user_id> --set passwordPolicies="DisablePasswordExpiration,DisableStrongPassword"
```
