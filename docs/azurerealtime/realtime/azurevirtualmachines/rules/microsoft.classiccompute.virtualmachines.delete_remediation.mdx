### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.delete event in AzureRealTime for AzureVirtualMachines refers to the deletion of a virtual machine (VM) in the classic deployment model in Azure.
- This event indicates that a specific VM, which was created using the classic deployment model, has been deleted from the Azure environment.
- The event can be used to track and monitor the deletion of VMs, allowing administrators to keep a record of VM lifecycle and take necessary actions if required.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Azure portal or API credentials and triggers the Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.delete event, they can delete virtual machines within the Azure environment. This can lead to data loss, service disruption, and potential security breaches.

Remediation:
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts to prevent unauthorized access to the Azure portal or API credentials.
- Regularly review and update access control policies to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete virtual machines.
- Implement Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to assign granular permissions to users and restrict the ability to delete virtual machines.
- Enable Azure Monitor and set up alerts to notify administrators when a virtual machine deletion event occurs, allowing for immediate investigation and response.

Azure CLI command to enable MFA for a user:
```
az ad user update --id <user-id> --force-change-password-next-login true
```

Azure CLI command to assign RBAC role to a user:
```
az role assignment create --assignee <user-id> --role <role-name> --scope <resource-scope>
```

Azure CLI command to create an Azure Monitor alert for virtual machine deletion:
```
az monitor metrics alert create --name <alert-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --condition "category=Administrative and operationName=Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/delete" --action <action-group-name> --description <alert-description>
```

2. Example of security impact: If a malicious insider with elevated privileges intentionally triggers the Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.delete event, they can delete critical virtual machines, causing significant damage to the Azure environment and disrupting business operations.

Remediation:
- Implement the principle of least privilege by regularly reviewing and updating user roles and permissions to ensure that only necessary privileges are granted.
- Enable Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enforce just-in-time access and require approval for elevated privileges, reducing the risk of unauthorized virtual machine deletions.
- Implement robust monitoring and logging solutions to detect and investigate any suspicious activities related to virtual machine deletions.
- Regularly backup virtual machines and critical data to ensure quick recovery in case of accidental or malicious deletions.

Azure CLI command to enable Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM):
```
az ad pim enable --id <user-id> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --role <role-name> --target-id <target-resource-id>
```

3. Example of security impact: If a misconfigured access control policy allows a user with limited privileges to trigger the Microsoft.ClassicCompute.virtualMachines.delete event, they can delete virtual machines that they should not have access to. This can result in unauthorized data exposure, service disruption, and potential compliance violations.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and update access control policies to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete virtual machines.
- Implement Azure Resource Locks to prevent accidental or unauthorized deletion of critical virtual machines.
- Enable Azure Policy to enforce compliance standards and prevent misconfigurations that could lead to unauthorized virtual machine deletions.
- Implement continuous monitoring and auditing of access control policies to detect and remediate any misconfigurations or unauthorized changes.

Azure CLI command to apply a resource lock to a virtual machine:
```
az lock create --name <lock-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --resource-name <virtual-machine-name> --resource-type Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines --lock-type CanNotDelete
```

Azure CLI command to enable Azure Policy for virtual machine deletion prevention:
```
az policy assignment create --name <policy-assignment-name> --scope <resource-scope> --policy <policy-definition-name> --params <policy-parameters>
```
