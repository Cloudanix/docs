### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Compute.images.write event in AzureRealTime for AzureVirtualMachines refers to the action of creating or updating a custom image in Azure.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process initiates the creation or modification of a custom image for virtual machines in Azure.
- It indicates that changes are being made to the image, such as adding or removing software, configuring settings, or updating the underlying operating system.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Microsoft.Compute.images.write event in Azure, they could potentially create or modify virtual machine images. This could lead to the deployment of compromised or malicious images, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to the virtual machines or compromise the integrity of the system.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have permissions to perform the Microsoft.Compute.images.write operation. Use Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to assign appropriate roles and permissions to users.
- Enable Azure Security Center: Azure Security Center provides continuous monitoring and threat detection for virtual machines. It can help identify and mitigate security risks related to image creation and modification. Enable the relevant security policies and recommendations provided by Azure Security Center.

Azure CLI command to assign a role to a user or service principal:
```
az role assignment create --assignee <user or service principal ID> --role "Virtual Machine Image Contributor" --scope <resource group or subscription ID>
```

2. Example of security impact: If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the Microsoft.Compute.images.write event, they could potentially delete or modify existing virtual machine images. This can lead to disruption of services, data loss, or unauthorized access to virtual machines.

Remediation:
- Enable Azure Backup: Regularly backup virtual machine images to ensure that they can be restored in case of accidental deletion or modification. Azure Backup provides a reliable and secure way to protect virtual machine images.
- Implement Azure Resource Locks: Use Azure Resource Locks to prevent accidental deletion or modification of critical virtual machine images. Apply the appropriate lock level (CanNotDelete or ReadOnly) to the resource group or individual images.

Azure CLI command to apply a resource lock to a resource group:
```
az lock create --name <lock name> --lock-type CanNotDelete --resource-group <resource group name>
```

3. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Microsoft.Compute.images.write event, they could potentially create or modify custom images used for virtual machine deployment. This can lead to the deployment of compromised or malicious images, resulting in security vulnerabilities or unauthorized access to virtual machines.

Remediation:
- Implement image validation processes: Before deploying custom images, implement a thorough validation process to ensure that the images are from trusted sources and free from any malicious code or vulnerabilities. Use tools like Azure Image Builder or Azure DevOps pipelines to automate image creation and validation.
- Enable Azure Monitor: Azure Monitor provides monitoring and alerting capabilities for virtual machines and related resources. Configure alerts for any suspicious or unauthorized image creation or modification events. Take immediate action upon receiving such alerts.

Azure CLI command to create an Azure Monitor alert rule:
```
az monitor metrics alert create --name <alert name> --resource <resource ID> --condition "Microsoft.Compute/images/write" --action <action group ID> --description <alert description>
```
