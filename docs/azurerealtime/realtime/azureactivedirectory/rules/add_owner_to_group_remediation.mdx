### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The "Add owner to group" event in Azure Active Directory refers to the action of adding a user as an owner to a specific group within the Azure AD.

2. This event signifies that the user who was added as an owner will have administrative privileges and control over the group, including the ability to manage membership, settings, and permissions.

3. By tracking this event, organizations can monitor and audit changes made to group ownership, ensuring proper access control and governance within their Azure AD environment.

#### Example

Example of how security can be impacted with the "Add owner to group" event in Azure Active Directory:

1. Unauthorized access: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Azure portal or has elevated privileges, they can add themselves as an owner to a group in Azure Active Directory. This can lead to potential security breaches as the unauthorized user will have access to sensitive resources and data within the group.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and audit group memberships: Implement a process to regularly review and audit group memberships in Azure Active Directory. This will help identify any unauthorized owners added to groups and take appropriate action.
- Enable Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM): Azure AD PIM provides just-in-time privileged access to Azure resources. By enabling PIM, you can enforce approval workflows and time-bound access for group ownership changes, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Example CLI command to review group memberships:
```
az ad group member list --group <group-id> --query [].userPrincipalName
```

Example CLI command to enable Azure AD PIM:
```
az ad pim enable --id <group-id> --role owner --target-id <target-id> --target-type <target-type>
```

Note: Replace `<group-id>`, `<target-id>`, and `<target-type>` with the appropriate values for your environment.
