### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Add group" event in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) refers to the action of creating a new group within the Azure AD tenant.
- This event signifies the addition of a new group entity, which can be used for organizing and managing users, applications, and resources within the Azure AD environment.
- The "Add group" event can be useful for tracking and auditing group creation activities, ensuring proper governance and access control within the Azure AD tenant.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Azure Active Directory and adds a group with elevated privileges, it can lead to potential security breaches. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data leakage, or unauthorized modifications to user permissions.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and audit Azure Active Directory groups to identify any unauthorized or suspicious additions.
- Implement strong access controls and permissions for Azure Active Directory, ensuring that only authorized users have the ability to add groups or modify permissions.
- Enable Azure Active Directory Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to provide just-in-time access to privileged roles, reducing the risk of unauthorized group additions.
- Monitor Azure Active Directory logs and set up alerts to detect any unusual activity related to group additions.
- Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Azure Active Directory to add an extra layer of security.

Example CLI command to review Azure Active Directory groups:
```
az ad group list --query "[].{Name: displayName, Description: description}"
```

2. Example of security impact: If an attacker gains access to an Azure resource with the necessary permissions to add a group in Azure Active Directory, they can create a malicious group and grant it elevated privileges. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or unauthorized modifications to resources.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls and permissions for Azure resources, ensuring that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to add groups or modify permissions.
- Regularly review and audit Azure resources to identify any unauthorized or suspicious group additions.
- Enable Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Azure Policy to enforce security controls and prevent unauthorized group additions.
- Monitor Azure activity logs and set up alerts to detect any unusual activity related to group additions.
- Consider implementing Azure Security Center to gain visibility into security threats and vulnerabilities.

Example CLI command to review Azure resource groups:
```
az group list --query "[].{Name: name, Location: location}"
```

3. Example of security impact: If a misconfiguration or vulnerability exists in the Azure Active Directory service itself, it could potentially allow an attacker to add a group with elevated privileges. This could result in unauthorized access, data breaches, or unauthorized modifications to user permissions.

Remediation:
- Regularly apply security patches and updates to Azure Active Directory to mitigate any known vulnerabilities.
- Implement Azure Active Directory Identity Protection to detect and prevent suspicious activities related to group additions.
- Enable Azure Active Directory Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enforce just-in-time access and reduce the risk of unauthorized group additions.
- Implement Azure AD Conditional Access policies to control access to Azure Active Directory and prevent unauthorized modifications.
- Regularly monitor Azure Active Directory logs and set up alerts to detect any unusual activity related to group additions.

Example CLI command to enable Azure Active Directory Identity Protection:
```
az ad identity-protection update --enabled true
```
