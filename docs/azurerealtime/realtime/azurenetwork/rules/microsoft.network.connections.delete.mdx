### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Network.connections.delete event in AzureRealTime for AzureNetwork refers to the deletion of a network connection in the Azure network.
- This event indicates that a network connection between two resources in the Azure network has been deleted.
- It is important to monitor this event as it can help track changes and ensure the network connections are properly managed and secured.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to delete network connections in Azure, they can potentially disrupt network connectivity, compromise data integrity, or even launch further attacks within the network. This can lead to service downtime, data breaches, and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete network connections. Use Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to assign appropriate roles and permissions to users.
- Enable Azure Network Watcher: Azure Network Watcher provides network monitoring and diagnostic capabilities. Enable it to detect and alert on any suspicious network activities, including unauthorized deletion of network connections.
- Monitor Azure Activity Logs: Regularly review Azure Activity Logs to identify any unauthorized or suspicious activities related to network connections. Set up alerts or integrate with Azure Monitor to receive real-time notifications.

Azure CLI command to enable Network Watcher:
```
az network watcher configure --enabled true --resource-group <resource-group-name> --location <location>
```

2. Example of security impact: If a malicious actor gains access to delete network connections in Azure, they can potentially disrupt communication between critical resources, leading to service interruptions or even complete network outages. This can result in financial losses, reputational damage, and potential data breaches.

Remediation:
- Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user accounts and regularly review and update access control policies. Use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to manage and monitor privileged access.
- Regularly backup network configurations: Take regular backups of network configurations, including network connections, subnets, and security groups. This ensures that in case of accidental or malicious deletion, the configurations can be restored quickly.
- Enable Azure Firewall or Network Security Groups (NSGs): Implement network security controls such as Azure Firewall or NSGs to restrict unauthorized access and prevent unauthorized deletion of network connections.

Azure CLI command to enable Azure Firewall:
```
az network firewall create --name <firewall-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --location <location>
```

3. Example of security impact: If an attacker gains access to delete network connections in Azure, they can potentially disrupt communication between critical resources, leading to service interruptions, data loss, or unauthorized access to sensitive information. This can result in financial losses, compliance violations, and reputational damage.

Remediation:
- Implement network segmentation: Divide your network into smaller, isolated segments using virtual networks (VNets) and subnets. This limits the impact of a potential network connection deletion to a specific segment, reducing the attack surface.
- Enable Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs): NSGs allow you to define inbound and outbound traffic rules to control network access. Configure NSGs to restrict access to network connections and prevent unauthorized deletion.
- Regularly review and audit network configurations: Conduct periodic reviews of network configurations, including network connections, to identify any unauthorized changes. Implement change management processes and track network configuration changes to ensure accountability.

Azure CLI command to enable Network Security Group (NSG):
```
az network nsg create --name <nsg-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --location <location>
```
