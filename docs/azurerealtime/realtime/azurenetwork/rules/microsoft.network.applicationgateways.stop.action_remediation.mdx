### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Network.applicationGateways.stop.action event in AzureRealtime for AzureNetwork indicates that an action has been taken to stop an application gateway in the Azure network.
- This event signifies that the application gateway has been intentionally stopped, which could be due to maintenance, troubleshooting, or scaling down the resources.
- It is important to monitor this event to ensure that the application gateway is stopped and started as per the desired configuration and operational requirements.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.Network.applicationGateways.stop.action event occurs in AzureNetwork, it could indicate that the application gateway, which acts as a load balancer and provides security features, has been stopped or disabled. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities, as the traffic may no longer be properly filtered or protected by the application gateway's security policies.

2. Remediation steps:
   - Verify the status of the application gateway using the Azure CLI command: `az network application-gateway show --name <gateway-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>`. Ensure that the "provisioningState" is "Succeeded" and the "state" is "Running".
   - If the application gateway is stopped, start it using the Azure CLI command: `az network application-gateway start --name <gateway-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>`.
   - Review the logs and investigate the reason for the stop action. Check for any misconfigurations, resource constraints, or unauthorized access that may have caused the stop action.
   - Implement appropriate security measures, such as enabling Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules, configuring SSL/TLS settings, and regularly monitoring the application gateway for any suspicious activities.

3. Additional considerations:
   - Regularly monitor the Azure portal or use Azure Monitor to set up alerts for any unexpected stop actions on the application gateway.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users have the permissions to modify or stop the application gateway.
   - Consider implementing Azure Firewall or Network Security Groups (NSGs) as additional layers of security to protect the network traffic in case of any issues with the application gateway.
