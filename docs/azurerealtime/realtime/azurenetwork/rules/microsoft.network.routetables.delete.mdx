### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Network.routeTables.delete event in AzureNetwork refers to the deletion of a route table in the Azure virtual network.
- This event indicates that a specific route table has been removed from the network configuration.
- It is important to note that deleting a route table may impact the network routing behavior, so it should be done with caution and proper planning.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.Network.routeTables.delete event is triggered in Azure, it could potentially impact security if a route table that is critical for network traffic management is accidentally deleted. This could result in disruption of network connectivity or unauthorized access to resources.

Remediation:
- Regularly backup route tables: Implement a backup strategy to regularly export and store the route table configurations. This can be done using Azure CLI command `az network route-table show --name <route_table_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --subscription <subscription_id> --output json > route_table_backup.json`.
- Enable soft delete for route tables: Soft delete allows you to recover deleted route tables within a specified retention period. Enable soft delete for route tables using Azure PowerShell command `Set-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtectionPolicy -Name "SoftDeletePolicy" -WorkloadType AzureVM -ItemType "Microsoft.Network/routeTables" -RetentionPeriodInDays 30`.
- Implement RBAC and access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have permissions to delete route tables. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and assign appropriate roles to users or groups. Regularly review and update access controls to minimize the risk of accidental deletions.

Note: The provided commands are examples and may need to be modified based on your specific Azure environment and requirements.
