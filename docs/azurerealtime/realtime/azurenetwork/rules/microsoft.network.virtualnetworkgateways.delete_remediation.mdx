### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Network.virtualNetworkGateways.delete event in AzureRealtime for AzureNetwork indicates that a virtual network gateway has been deleted in the Azure network.
- This event signifies that the virtual network gateway, which provides connectivity between on-premises networks and Azure virtual networks, has been removed from the network.
- The event can be used to track and monitor changes in the network infrastructure, allowing administrators to keep track of gateway deletions and take appropriate actions if necessary.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.Network.virtualNetworkGateways.delete event is triggered in Azure, it could potentially lead to a security breach if the virtual network gateway being deleted is still actively used by other resources or services. This could result in a loss of connectivity or unauthorized access to the network.

2. Remediation steps:
   - Before deleting a virtual network gateway, ensure that it is not being used by any other resources or services. You can check for dependencies using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or PowerShell.
   - If dependencies are found, update the configuration of those resources to use a different virtual network gateway or remove the dependencies altogether.
   - Once all dependencies are resolved, you can safely delete the virtual network gateway using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or PowerShell.

Example Azure CLI command to check for dependencies:
```
az network vnet-gateway list --query "[?contains(dependencies, 'Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks')].name"
```

Example Azure CLI command to delete a virtual network gateway:
```
az network vnet-gateway delete --name <gateway-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>
```

Note: Replace `<gateway-name>` with the actual name of the virtual network gateway and `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the resource group it belongs to.

3. Best practices:
   - Regularly review and audit the usage of virtual network gateways to identify any potential security risks or unused resources.
   - Implement proper access controls and permissions to prevent unauthorized deletion of virtual network gateways.
   - Consider implementing backup and disaster recovery mechanisms for critical virtual network gateways to minimize the impact of accidental deletions.
