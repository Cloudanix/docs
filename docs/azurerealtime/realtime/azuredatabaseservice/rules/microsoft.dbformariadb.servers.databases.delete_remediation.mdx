### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.databases.delete event in AzureRealtime for AzureDatabaseService refers to the deletion of a database within a MariaDB server in Azure.
- This event indicates that a specific database has been deleted, and it can be used to track changes and monitor database management activities.
- It is important to note that this event does not delete the entire MariaDB server, but only a specific database within it.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.databases.delete event is triggered in Azure Database Service for MariaDB, it could indicate that a database has been deleted without proper authorization or by an unauthorized user. This can lead to data loss, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and potential compliance violations.

Remediation:
- Immediately investigate the event to determine the cause and extent of the security impact.
- Restore the deleted database from a recent backup, if available.
- Change the access credentials and passwords for the affected database to prevent unauthorized access.
- Review and update the access control policies and permissions to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary privileges to delete databases.
- Enable auditing and monitoring features in Azure Database Service to track and alert on any suspicious activities.
- Regularly review and analyze the audit logs to identify any potential security incidents or unauthorized actions.

Azure CLI command to restore a deleted MariaDB database:
```
az mariadb server restore --name <server_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --restore-time <restore_time> --target-name <new_database_name>
```

2. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.databases.delete event is triggered in Azure Database Service for MariaDB, it could indicate a misconfiguration or vulnerability in the access control settings. An attacker may have exploited this vulnerability to delete a database, potentially leading to data loss or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Remediation:
- Immediately investigate the event to determine the cause and extent of the security impact.
- Review and update the access control policies and permissions to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary privileges to delete databases.
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access to the Azure Database Service.
- Regularly review and update the database firewall rules to restrict access to trusted IP addresses or ranges.
- Enable network security groups (NSGs) to control inbound and outbound traffic to the Azure Database Service.
- Regularly monitor and analyze the audit logs and enable threat detection features to detect and respond to any suspicious activities.

Azure CLI command to update database firewall rules:
```
az mariadb server firewall-rule create --name <firewall_rule_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --server-name <server_name> --start-ip-address <start_ip_address> --end-ip-address <end_ip_address>
```

3. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.databases.delete event is triggered in Azure Database Service for MariaDB, it could indicate a compromised account or credentials. An attacker may have gained unauthorized access to an account with sufficient privileges to delete databases, potentially leading to data loss or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Remediation:
- Immediately investigate the event to determine the cause and extent of the security impact.
- Disable or reset the compromised account to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Review and update the access control policies and permissions to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary privileges to delete databases.
- Implement strong password policies and enforce regular password rotations for all user accounts.
- Enable Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) integration and enforce Azure AD authentication for the Azure Database Service.
- Regularly monitor and analyze the audit logs and enable anomaly detection features to detect and respond to any suspicious activities.

Azure CLI command to disable a user account:
```
az mariadb server ad-admin delete --name <server_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --login <user_login>
```
