### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.administrators.delete event in azurerealtime for AzureDatabaseService refers to the deletion of an administrator for a MariaDB server in Azure.
- This event indicates that an administrator account has been removed from the MariaDB server, which may impact the access and management of the server.
- It is important to monitor this event to track any changes made to the administrators of the MariaDB server and ensure proper access control and security measures are in place.

#### Example

1. Impact on Security: The Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.administrators.delete event in AzureRealtime for AzureDatabaseService can potentially impact security by allowing unauthorized deletion of administrators for the MariaDB server. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or disruption of service.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and monitor the Azure Activity Log and Azure Monitor for any unexpected or unauthorized administrator deletion events.
- Implement strong access controls and permissions for administrators, ensuring that only authorized individuals have the necessary privileges to delete administrators.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrators to add an extra layer of security.
- Regularly backup the MariaDB server to ensure data can be restored in case of accidental or malicious deletion.

Example CLI Command:
```
az mariadb server ad-admin delete --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server-name <server-name> --name <administrator-name>
```

2. Impact on Security: The Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.administrators.delete event in AzureRealtime for AzureDatabaseService can also impact security if an attacker gains unauthorized access to the Azure portal or API and deletes administrators without proper authorization. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or disruption of service.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls for Azure portal and API, including strong passwords, role-based access control (RBAC), and conditional access policies.
- Enable Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to require just-in-time access for administrators, reducing the attack surface.
- Regularly review and monitor Azure AD sign-in logs and Azure Monitor for any suspicious or unauthorized access attempts.
- Implement Azure Security Center and enable threat detection and prevention mechanisms to identify and mitigate potential security threats.

Example Bash Script:
```bash
az login
az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
az mariadb server ad-admin delete --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server-name <server-name> --name <administrator-name>
```

3. Impact on Security: The Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.administrators.delete event in AzureRealtime for AzureDatabaseService can also impact security if a malicious insider or compromised account deletes administrators without proper authorization. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or disruption of service.

Remediation:
- Implement strong identity and access management practices, including regular review and revocation of unnecessary administrator privileges.
- Enable Azure AD Identity Protection to detect and mitigate suspicious activities related to administrator accounts.
- Implement Azure AD Conditional Access policies to enforce additional security measures, such as requiring multi-factor authentication or blocking access from certain locations or devices.
- Regularly review and monitor Azure AD audit logs and Azure Monitor for any suspicious or unauthorized activities related to administrator accounts.

Example Shell Script:
```shell
az login
az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
az mariadb server ad-admin delete --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server-name <server-name> --name <administrator-name>
```
