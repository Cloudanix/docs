### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.Sql.servers.delete event in AzureRealTime for AzureDatabaseService indicates that a SQL server instance has been deleted in the Azure SQL Database service.
- This event signifies that all databases, logins, firewall rules, and other associated resources within the SQL server have been permanently removed.
- It is important to note that this event is irreversible and any data or configurations within the SQL server will be lost after deletion.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Azure Database Service and performs a Microsoft.Sql.servers.delete event, it can lead to the deletion of the entire SQL server and all associated databases. This can result in a loss of critical data and disrupt business operations.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have access to the Azure Database Service. Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
- Enable auditing and monitoring: Enable auditing and monitoring features in Azure to track and log all activities related to the Azure Database Service. This will help in identifying any unauthorized access or suspicious activities.
- Regular backups: Implement a regular backup strategy for the databases hosted on the Azure Database Service. This will help in recovering the data in case of accidental deletion or security incidents.

Azure CLI command to enable auditing for Azure SQL Database:
```
az sql db audit-policy update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <server-name> --database <database-name> --state Enabled
```

Azure CLI command to configure RBAC for Azure SQL Database:
```
az sql server ad-admin create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server <server-name> --display-name <display-name> --object-id <object-id>
```

2. Example of security impact: If a malicious insider gains access to the Azure Database Service and performs a Microsoft.Sql.servers.delete event, they can delete specific databases or modify the server configuration, leading to data loss or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Remediation:
- Implement least privilege access: Follow the principle of least privilege and grant only the necessary permissions to users and roles. Regularly review and update access permissions to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for all users accessing the Azure Database Service. This adds an extra layer of security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
- Regularly review audit logs: Monitor and review the audit logs generated by the Azure Database Service. Look for any suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts. Implement automated alerts to notify security teams of any potential security incidents.

Azure CLI command to enable MFA for Azure SQL Database:
```
az sql server update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <server-name> --admin-password <admin-password> --enable-mfa true
```

3. Example of security impact: If a misconfigured access control policy allows public access to the Azure Database Service, an attacker can perform a Microsoft.Sql.servers.delete event from an external network. This can result in the deletion of the SQL server and all associated databases, leading to data loss and service disruption.

Remediation:
- Implement network security groups (NSGs): Configure NSGs to restrict inbound and outbound traffic to the Azure Database Service. Only allow necessary ports and protocols from trusted networks.
- Enable virtual network service endpoints: Configure virtual network service endpoints for the Azure Database Service. This ensures that the service can only be accessed from within the specified virtual network, reducing the attack surface.
- Regularly review and update access control policies: Regularly review and update access control policies for the Azure Database Service. Ensure that public access is disabled and only authorized networks or IP ranges are allowed to access the service.

Azure CLI command to configure NSG rules for Azure SQL Database:
```
az network nsg rule create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --nsg-name <nsg-name> --name <rule-name> --protocol <protocol> --direction <direction> --source-address-prefix <source-address-prefix> --source-port-range <source-port-range> --destination-address-prefix <destination-address-prefix> --destination-port-range <destination-port-range> --access <access> --priority <priority>
```

Azure CLI command to configure virtual network service endpoints for Azure SQL Database:
```
az network vnet subnet update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --vnet-name <vnet-name> --name <subnet-name> --service-endpoints Microsoft.Sql
```
