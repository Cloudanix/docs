### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.delete event in AzureRealtime for AzureDatabaseService indicates that a deletion operation has been performed on a MariaDB server in Azure.
2. This event signifies that a specific MariaDB server instance has been permanently removed from the Azure environment.
3. It is important to note that this event does not include any information about the reason for deletion or any associated data backups.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Azure Database Service and triggers the Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.delete event, it can lead to the deletion of the MariaDB server and all associated databases. This can result in a loss of critical data and disrupt the application relying on the database.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have access to the Azure Database Service. Use Azure Active Directory authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to the service.
- Enable auditing and monitoring: Enable auditing and monitoring features provided by Azure Database Service to track any suspicious activities. Set up alerts to notify administrators in case of any unexpected events.
- Regular backups: Implement a backup strategy to regularly backup the MariaDB server and its databases. This will help in recovering the data in case of accidental deletion or any other security incidents.

Azure CLI command to enable auditing for Azure Database for MariaDB:
```
az mariadb server update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <server-name> --auditing-state Enabled
```

Azure CLI command to configure RBAC for Azure Database for MariaDB:
```
az mariadb server ad-admin create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server-name <server-name> --display-name <display-name> --object-id <object-id>
```

2. Example of security impact: If a malicious user gains access to the Azure Database Service and triggers the Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.delete event, they can delete the MariaDB server and create a new one with a different configuration. This can be used as a way to gain unauthorized access to the database or to cover up any malicious activities.

Remediation:
- Implement strong password policies: Enforce the use of strong passwords for the Azure Database Service. Use a combination of alphanumeric characters, special characters, and enforce password rotation policies.
- Enable threat detection: Enable threat detection feature provided by Azure Database Service. This will help in detecting any suspicious activities or potential security threats.
- Regularly review access logs: Regularly review the access logs and audit logs of the Azure Database Service to identify any unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities.

Azure CLI command to enable threat detection for Azure Database for MariaDB:
```
az mariadb server update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <server-name> --threat-detection-state Enabled
```

Azure CLI command to review audit logs for Azure Database for MariaDB:
```
az mariadb server-logs list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server-name <server-name> --file-last-written <file-last-written>
```

3. Example of security impact: If a misconfigured access control policy allows a user with delete permissions to trigger the Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.delete event, it can lead to the accidental deletion of the MariaDB server. This can result in data loss and service disruption.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and update access control policies: Regularly review and update the access control policies for the Azure Database Service. Ensure that only authorized users have delete permissions and that the policies are properly configured.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA for all user accounts accessing the Azure Database Service. This adds an extra layer of security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
- Implement backup and disaster recovery: Implement a robust backup and disaster recovery strategy for the MariaDB server. Regularly backup the databases and test the restoration process to ensure data can be recovered in case of accidental deletion.

Azure CLI command to enable MFA for Azure Database for MariaDB:
```
az mariadb server ad-admin update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server-name <server-name> --display-name <display-name> --object-id <object-id> --mfa <mfa-setting>
```

Azure CLI command to configure backup for Azure Database for MariaDB:
```
az mariadb server backup create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server-name <server-name> --name <backup-name> --storage-container <storage-container> --retention <retention-period>
```
