### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.databases.write event in azurerealtime for AzureDatabaseService refers to a write operation performed on a database within the Azure Database for MariaDB service.
- This event indicates that data has been modified or inserted into a specific database within the MariaDB server.
- It is important to monitor this event to track changes made to the database and ensure data integrity and consistency.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.DBforMariaDB.servers.databases.write event in AzureRealtime for AzureDatabaseService is compromised, it could potentially allow unauthorized users to write or modify data in the MariaDB database. This could lead to data breaches, data loss, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Remediation:
- Enable firewall rules: Configure firewall rules to restrict access to the MariaDB server only from trusted IP addresses or virtual networks. This helps prevent unauthorized access to the database.
```
az mariadb server firewall-rule create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --server-name <server-name> --name <firewall-rule-name> --start-ip-address <start-ip-address> --end-ip-address <end-ip-address>
```

- Implement strong authentication: Ensure that strong authentication mechanisms, such as username/password or Azure Active Directory authentication, are enforced for accessing the MariaDB server. This helps prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to the database.
```
az mariadb server update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <server-name> --admin-password <new-password>
```

- Regularly update and patch: Keep the MariaDB server up to date with the latest security patches and updates. Regularly check for updates and apply them to address any known vulnerabilities.
```
az mariadb server update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <server-name> --version <new-version>
```
