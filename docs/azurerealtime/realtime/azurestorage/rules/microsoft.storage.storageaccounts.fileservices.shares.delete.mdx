### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The Microsoft.Storage.storageAccounts.fileServices.shares.delete event in AzureRealTime for AzureStorage indicates that a file share has been deleted within a storage account.
2. This event signifies that the data stored within the deleted file share will no longer be accessible.
3. It is important to monitor this event as it can help track and audit changes made to file shares, ensuring data integrity and compliance with data retention policies.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the Microsoft.Storage.storageAccounts.fileServices.shares.delete event is triggered in Azure Storage, it could indicate that a file share has been deleted. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the file share, compromising the security of the storage account.

2. Remediation steps:
   - Immediately investigate the event to determine the cause and scope of the deletion.
   - Restore the deleted file share from a backup if available. If not, attempt to recover the data from other sources or replicas.
   - Review access controls and permissions for the storage account to ensure that only authorized users have the ability to delete file shares.
   - Enable auditing and monitoring for file share deletions to detect and respond to such events in real-time.
   - Regularly backup critical data stored in Azure Storage to minimize the impact of accidental or malicious deletions.

Example CLI command to restore a deleted file share from a backup:
```
az storage share restore --account-name <storage_account_name> --name <deleted_share_name> --deleted-share-version <version_id>
```

Note: The specific command may vary depending on the Azure CLI version and the storage account configuration. Please refer to the Azure documentation for the most up-to-date command syntax.
