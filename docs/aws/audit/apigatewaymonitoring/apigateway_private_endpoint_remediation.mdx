How to change Amazon API Gateway APIs endpoint type?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the left navigation panel, select APIs to open the APIs listing page. Choose the API that you want to reconfigure.
  (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource), then click on the API settings button (gear icon):
  to enter the configuration edit mode.

- Step 2: In the Endpoint Configuration section, select Private from the Endpoint Type dropdown list to change the selected API endpoint type to private.

- Step 3: Before your private API can be accessed, you have to create a resource policy and attach it to the selected API. This policy should grant access to the API from your VPC endpoints or from VPC endpoints available in other AWS accounts that you explicitly grant access. Within the API box, click on the Configure Resource Policy link to open the resource policy page.

- Step 4: On the Resource Policy page, paste the following API resource policy template. Replace each highlighted placeholder with your own configuration information:
  {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
  {
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": "_",
  "Action": "execute-api:Invoke",
  "Resource": [
  "arn:aws:execute-api:::/_"
  ]
  },
  {
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Principal": "_",
  "Action": "execute-api:Invoke",
  "Resource": [
  "arn:aws:execute-api:::/_"
  ],
  "Condition" : {
  "StringNotEquals": {
  "aws:SourceVpce": ""
  }
  }
  }
  ]
  }
  Replace (including the curly braces) with your own VPC endpoint ID. If you don't have a VPC endpoint already created, follow the steps outlined in this conformity rule to create one. The resource policy placeholders are enclosed in double curly braces (e.g. ). Replace each placeholder with your own configuration information.

- Step 5: Click Save to apply the policy to the selected API.
