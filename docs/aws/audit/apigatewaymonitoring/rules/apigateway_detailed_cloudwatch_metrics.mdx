### More Info:

Detailed CloudWatch metrics should be enabled for all APIs created with AWS API Gateway service in order to monitor API stages caching, latency and detected errors at a more granular level and set alarms accordingly.

### Risk Level

Low

### Remediation

How to enable cloudwatch metrics for all APIs?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Access the API Gateway Console:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the API Gateway service.
2. Enable Detailed CloudWatch Metrics for an API:
   - Select the API for which you want to enable CloudWatch metrics.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Cloudwatch Metrics Must Be Enabled For All APIs" Policy.)
   - Click on the "Settings" tab.
3. Enable Detailed Metrics:
   - Under the "CloudWatch Settings" section, toggle the "Enable Detailed CloudWatch Metrics" option to enable it.
4. Save the Configuration:
   - Click on the "Save Changes" button to save the configuration for the API.
5. Repeat for Other APIs:
   - Repeat steps 2 to 4 for each API where you want to enable CloudWatch metrics.
6. View Metrics in CloudWatch:
   - Access the CloudWatch console.
   - Navigate to the "Metrics" section and select "API Gateway" as the namespace.
   - Choose the desired API and metric dimension to view the available metrics.
7. Create Alarms or Dashboards (Optional):
   - If desired, you can create CloudWatch alarms based on the API Gateway metrics to monitor specific thresholds or conditions.
   - Additionally, you can create CloudWatch dashboards to visualize and monitor the metrics of multiple APIs in a centralized view.
