### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of "CloudWatch Metrics Must Be Enabled For All APIs in API Gateway" using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to API Gateway:**
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - In the Services menu, select "API Gateway" under the "Networking & Content Delivery" section.

2. **Select Your API:**
   - In the API Gateway console, select the API for which you want to enable CloudWatch metrics.
   - Click on the API name to open its configuration.

3. **Enable CloudWatch Metrics:**
   - In the left-hand navigation pane, select "Stages."
   - Choose the stage (e.g., `prod`, `dev`) for which you want to enable CloudWatch metrics.
   - In the Stage Editor, under the "Logs/Tracing" tab, check the box for "Enable CloudWatch Metrics."

4. **Save Changes:**
   - Click the "Save Changes" button at the bottom of the page to apply the configuration.

By following these steps, you ensure that CloudWatch metrics are enabled for all APIs in API Gateway, which helps in monitoring and managing your API performance and usage effectively.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To ensure that CloudWatch Metrics are enabled for all APIs in API Gateway using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **List All API Gateway Rest APIs:**
   First, you need to list all the Rest APIs in your account to identify which APIs need CloudWatch Metrics enabled.
   ```sh
   aws apigateway get-rest-apis
   ```

2. **Get Stages for Each API:**
   For each API, list all the stages to identify where to enable CloudWatch Metrics.
   ```sh
   aws apigateway get-stages --rest-api-id <rest-api-id>
   ```

3. **Enable CloudWatch Metrics for Each Stage:**
   For each stage of each API, enable CloudWatch Metrics by updating the stage settings.
   ```sh
   aws apigateway update-stage --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> --stage-name <stage-name> --patch-operations op=replace,path=/metrics/enabled,value=true
   ```

4. **Verify the Configuration:**
   Finally, verify that CloudWatch Metrics are enabled for the stages.
   ```sh
   aws apigateway get-stage --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> --stage-name <stage-name>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that CloudWatch Metrics are enabled for all APIs in API Gateway using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To ensure that CloudWatch Metrics are enabled for all APIs in API Gateway using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Below are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**:
   Initialize the Boto3 client for API Gateway.
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('apigateway')
   ```

3. **List All APIs**:
   Retrieve a list of all APIs in your account.
   ```python
   def list_apis():
       response = client.get_rest_apis()
       return response['items']

   apis = list_apis()
   ```

4. **Enable CloudWatch Metrics for Each API**:
   Iterate through each API and enable CloudWatch Metrics.
   ```python
   def enable_cloudwatch_metrics(api_id):
       stages = client.get_stages(restApiId=api_id)
       for stage in stages['item']:
           client.update_stage(
               restApiId=api_id,
               stageName=stage['stageName'],
               patchOperations=[
                   {
                       'op': 'replace',
                       'path': '/*/*/metrics/enabled',
                       'value': 'true'
                   }
               ]
           )

   for api in apis:
       enable_cloudwatch_metrics(api['id'])
   ```

This script will ensure that CloudWatch Metrics are enabled for all stages of all APIs in your API Gateway. Hereâ€™s a summary of the steps:

1. **Install Boto3**: Ensure Boto3 is installed.
2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**: Set up the Boto3 client for API Gateway.
3. **List All APIs**: Retrieve all APIs in your account.
4. **Enable CloudWatch Metrics for Each API**: Iterate through each API and enable CloudWatch Metrics for all stages.

By following these steps, you can programmatically ensure that CloudWatch Metrics are enabled for all APIs in your API Gateway.

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the API Gateway service.
2. In the API Gateway dashboard, select the APIs section on the left-hand side.
3. In the APIs list, select the API you want to check. This will open the API's settings.
4. In the API settings, navigate to the Stages section. Here, you can see if CloudWatch metrics are enabled for each stage of the API. If the CloudWatch metrics are not enabled, it indicates a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all APIs: Use the following command to list all the APIs in API Gateway:
   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-apis
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the APIs in your AWS account.

3. Check Cloudwatch Metrics for each API: For each API in the list, you need to check if Cloudwatch Metrics are enabled. You can do this by running the following command for each API:
   ```
   aws apigateway get-stage --rest-api-id <api-id> --stage-name <stage-name>
   ```
   Replace `<api-id>` with the ID of the API and `<stage-name>` with the name of the stage you want to check. This command will return the details of the specified stage.

4. Verify Cloudwatch Metrics: In the output of the previous command, look for the `metricsEnabled` field. If its value is `true`, then Cloudwatch Metrics are enabled for that API. If its value is `false` or if the `metricsEnabled` field is not present, then Cloudwatch Metrics are not enabled for that API.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3):**
   First, you need to set up AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, configure your AWS credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using the AWS CLI.

2. **List all APIs in API Gateway:**
   Use the `get_rest_apis` function from the `apigateway` client in boto3 to get a list of all APIs in API Gateway. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_apis():
       client = boto3.client('apigateway')
       response = client.get_rest_apis()
       return response['items']

   apis = list_apis()
   for api in apis:
       print(api['name'])
   ```
   This script will print the names of all APIs in API Gateway.

3. **Check CloudWatch Metrics for each API:**
   For each API, check if CloudWatch metrics are enabled. You can do this by checking the `metricsEnabled` attribute of the `methodSettings` for each method of each resource of the API. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_metrics(api):
       client = boto3.client('apigateway')
       resources = client.get_resources(restApiId=api['id'])['items']
       for resource in resources:
           methods = resource.get('resourceMethods', {})
           for method in methods:
               settings = client.get_method_settings(
                   restApiId=api['id'],
                   resourceId=resource['id'],
                   httpMethod=method
               )
               if not settings['methodSettings']['metricsEnabled']:
                   print(f"CloudWatch Metrics not enabled for API {api['name']}, resource {resource['path']}, method {method}")

   apis = list_apis()
   for api in apis:
       check_metrics(api)
   ```
   This script will print the names of APIs, resources, and methods for which CloudWatch Metrics are not enabled.

4. **Interpret the Results:**
   If the script prints any APIs, resources, and methods, it means that CloudWatch Metrics are not enabled for them. If it doesn't print anything, it means that CloudWatch Metrics are enabled for all APIs in API Gateway.
