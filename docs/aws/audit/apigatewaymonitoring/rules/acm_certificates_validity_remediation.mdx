### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of AWS ACM Certificates not being valid, you can follow the below steps in AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) console.
3. Select the certificate that is not valid and click on it.
4. Check the certificate status on the Certificate Summary page. If the certificate is expired, then it needs to be renewed. If the certificate is not expired, then check the domain name and ensure that it is correctly specified.
5. If the domain name is incorrect, then update it on the Certificate Summary page.
6. If the certificate is expired, then click on the "Renew" button on the Certificate Summary page.
7. Follow the steps in the Renew Certificate wizard to renew the certificate.
8. Once the certificate is renewed, update its status on the server where it is being used.
9. Verify that the certificate is now valid.

Following these steps will remediate the issue of AWS ACM Certificates not being valid.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of AWS ACM Certificates Not Valid, follow these steps in AWS CLI:

1. Identify the certificate that is not valid by running the following command:
```
aws acm list-certificates --certificate-statuses ISSUED --query "CertificateSummaryList[?NotAfter<'$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")'].CertificateArn" --output text
```
This will list all the certificates that are not valid.

2. Once you have identified the certificate, delete it by running the following command:
```
aws acm delete-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn>
```
Replace `<certificate-arn>` with the ARN of the certificate you want to delete.

3. Create a new certificate by running the following command:
```
aws acm request-certificate --domain-name <domain-name> --validation-method DNS
```
Replace `<domain-name>` with the domain name for which you want to request a new certificate.

4. After creating the new certificate, you will need to validate it. To do this, run the following command to get the DNS validation record:
```
aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn> --query "Certificate.DomainValidationOptions[0].ResourceRecord" --output text
```
Replace `<certificate-arn>` with the ARN of the new certificate.

5. Once you have the DNS validation record, add it as a DNS record in your domain provider's DNS settings.

6. After adding the DNS record, wait for a few minutes for the DNS record to propagate.

7. Finally, run the following command to validate the certificate:
```
aws acm add-tags-to-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn> --tags Key=Validation,Value=<validation-value>
```
Replace `<certificate-arn>` with the ARN of the new certificate, and `<validation-value>` with the validation value that you obtained in step 4.

After completing these steps, the new certificate should be valid and ready to use.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of AWS ACM Certificates not being valid using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```
import boto3
import datetime
```

2. Create a boto3 session:

```
session = boto3.Session(region_name='your_region_name')
```

3. Create an ACM client:

```
acm_client = session.client('acm')
```

4. Get a list of all certificates:

```
certificates = acm_client.list_certificates()['CertificateSummaryList']
```

5. Loop through the certificates and check if they are valid:

```
for cert in certificates:
    cert_arn = cert['CertificateArn']
    cert_details = acm_client.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
    not_after = cert_details['Certificate']['NotAfter']
    if not_after < datetime.datetime.now(not_after.tzinfo):
        acm_client.renew_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
```

6. The above code will check if the certificate is valid or not. If it is not valid, it will renew the certificate.

7. Once the certificates are renewed, you can verify them by checking their status:

```
for cert in certificates:
    cert_arn = cert['CertificateArn']
    cert_details = acm_client.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
    status = cert_details['Certificate']['Status']
    print(f"{cert_arn} - {status}")
```

8. This will print the ARN of the certificate and its status.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of AWS ACM Certificates not being valid using Python.
