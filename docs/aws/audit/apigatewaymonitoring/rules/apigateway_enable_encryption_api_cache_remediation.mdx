### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling encryption for API cache in AWS, please follow the below steps:

1. Login to the AWS console and navigate to the Amazon API Gateway service.

2. Click on the API that you want to remediate.

3. Click on the "Stages" tab and select the stage that you want to remediate.

4. Click on the "Cache" tab and select the cache that you want to remediate.

5. Click on the "Edit" button located in the top right corner of the screen.

6. Scroll down to the "Encryption" section and select the "Enable Encryption" checkbox.

7. Choose the KMS key that you want to use for encryption from the dropdown list.

8. Click on the "Save Changes" button to save the changes.

9. Verify that the cache is now encrypted by checking the "Encryption" status in the cache details.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration of enabling encryption for API cache in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling encryption for API Cache in AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to enable encryption for API Cache:

```
aws apigateway update-rest-api \
--rest-api-id <REST_API_ID> \
--patch-operations op=replace,path=/minimumCompressionSize,value=<VALUE> op=add,path=/policy,value='<POLICY>'
```

Here, replace `<REST_API_ID>` with the ID of the REST API that you want to update. Replace `<VALUE>` with the minimum size of a response before it is compressed. Replace `<POLICY>` with the policy that you want to apply to the cache.

3. Add the following JSON policy to the cache:

```
{
    "CacheEncryptionEnabled": true
}
```

This policy enables encryption for the API Cache.

4. Save the changes by running the following command:

```
aws apigateway create-deployment \
--rest-api-id <REST_API_ID> \
--stage-name <STAGE_NAME>
```

Here, replace `<REST_API_ID>` with the ID of the REST API that you want to update. Replace `<STAGE_NAME>` with the name of the API Gateway stage that you want to deploy the changes to.

5. Verify that the encryption is enabled for the API Cache by running the following command:

```
aws apigateway get-rest-api \
--rest-api-id <REST_API_ID> \
--query 'binaryMediaTypes'
```

This command returns the binary media types that are supported by the REST API, including the encryption settings for the API Cache.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of enabling encryption for API Cache in AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To enable encryption for API Cache in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

```
import boto3
```

Step 2: Create a boto3 client for Amazon API Gateway

```
client = boto3.client('apigateway')
```

Step 3: Get the ID of the API Cache for which you want to enable encryption

```
response = client.get_rest_api_cache(
    restApiId='your_rest_api_id',
    cacheClusterId='your_cache_cluster_id'
)
api_cache_id = response['id']
```

Step 4: Enable encryption for the API Cache

```
response = client.update_rest_api_cache(
    restApiId='your_rest_api_id',
    cacheClusterId='your_cache_cluster_id',
    patchOperations=[
        {
            'op': 'replace',
            'path': '/encryptionEnabled',
            'value': 'true'
        }
    ]
)
```

The above code will enable encryption for the specified API Cache. You can replace the `your_rest_api_id` and `your_cache_cluster_id` with the actual values for your API Cache.
