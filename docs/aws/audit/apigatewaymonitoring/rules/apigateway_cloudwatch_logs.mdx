How to enable cloudwatch logs for all APIs?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Access the API Gateway Console:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the API Gateway service.
2. Enable CloudWatch Logs for an API:
   - Select the API for which you want to enable CloudWatch Logs.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Cloudwatch Logs Must Be Enabled For All APIs" Policy.)
   - Click on the "Stages" tab and choose the desired stage (e.g., "Prod").
3. Enable Logging for the Stage:
   - In the stage settings, click on the "Logs/Tracing" tab.
   - Under the "CloudWatch Settings" section, toggle the "Enable CloudWatch Logs" option to enable it.
4. Specify Log Level (Optional):
   - Optionally, you can specify the log level for your API's logs by selecting the appropriate option from the "Log level" dropdown.
5. Save the Configuration:
   - Click on the "Save Changes" button to save the configuration for the selected stage.
6. Repeat for Other APIs and Stages:
   - Repeat steps 2 to 5 for each API and stage where you want to enable CloudWatch Logs.
7. Verify Log Group Creation:
   - Access the CloudWatch Logs console.
   - Confirm that log groups have been created for each enabled API and stage. The log group name follows the pattern `/aws/api-gateway/{API_ID}/{STAGE}`.
8. View and Analyze Logs:
   - Access the CloudWatch Logs console and navigate to the log group corresponding to the desired API and stage.
   - View and analyze the logs generated by your API for monitoring, troubleshooting, and analysis purposes.
