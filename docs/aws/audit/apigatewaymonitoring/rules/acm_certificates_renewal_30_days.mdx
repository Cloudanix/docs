5. In the certificate details page, click on the "Renew" button.
6. In the "Renew Certificate" dialog box, review the renewal details and click on the "Renew" button again.
7. AWS ACM will start the renewal process and request a new certificate for your API Gateway.
8. Once the new certificate is issued, it will replace the expired or expiring certificate automatically.
9. After the certificate is renewed, go to the API Gateway service by selecting "API Gateway" from the services menu.
10. In the API Gateway dashboard, select the API Gateway instance that is using the renewed ACM certificate.
11. Click on the "Custom Domain Names" tab in the left navigation pane.
12. Select the custom domain name associated with the API Gateway.
13. In the domain details page, locate the "Certificate" section.
14. Verify that the renewed ACM certificate is now being used for the custom domain name. It should display the new expiration date.
15. Test the API Gateway to ensure that the renewed certificate is properly configured and working.
