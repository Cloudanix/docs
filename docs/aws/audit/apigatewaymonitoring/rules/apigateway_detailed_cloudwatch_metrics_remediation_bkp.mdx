     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Cloudwatch Metrics Must Be Enabled For All APIs" Policy.)
   - Click on the "Settings" tab.
3. Enable Detailed Metrics:

4. Save the Configuration:
   - Click on the "Save Changes" button to save the configuration for the API.
5. Repeat for Other APIs:
   - Repeat steps 2 to 4 for each API where you want to enable CloudWatch metrics.
6. View Metrics in CloudWatch:
   - Access the CloudWatch console.
   - Navigate to the "Metrics" section and select "API Gateway" as the namespace.
   - Choose the desired API and metric dimension to view the available metrics.
7. Create Alarms or Dashboards (Optional):
   - If desired, you can create CloudWatch alarms based on the API Gateway metrics to monitor specific thresholds or conditions.
   - Additionally, you can create CloudWatch dashboards to visualize and monitor the metrics of multiple APIs in a centralized view.
