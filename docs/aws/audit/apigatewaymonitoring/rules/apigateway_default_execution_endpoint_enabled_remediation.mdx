4. Click on the "Configuration" tab.
5. Scroll down to the "General configuration" section.
6. Under the "Execution role" section, click on the "Edit" button.
7. Scroll down to the "Network" section.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Default Execution Endpoint Should Not Be Enabled" in AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or a cloud-based instance with appropriate permissions.

2. Run the following command to disable the default execution endpoint:
   
   ```
   aws sagemaker update-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <notebook-instance-name> --default-code-repository ""
   ```
   Note: Replace `<notebook-instance-name>` with the name of the notebook instance that needs to be remediated.

3. Verify that the default execution endpoint has been disabled by running the following command:
   
   ```
   aws sagemaker describe-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <notebook-instance-name> | grep DefaultCodeRepository
   ```

   This command should return an empty string, indicating that the default code repository has been removed.

4. Repeat the above steps for all the notebook instances in your AWS account.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Default Execution Endpoint Should Not Be Enabled" in AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Default Execution Endpoint Should Not Be Enabled" in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

Step 2: Create a boto3 client session for AWS Lambda

```python
lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')
```

Step 3: Use the `update_function_configuration` method to disable the default execution endpoint

```python
try:
    response = lambda_client.update_function_configuration(
        FunctionName='YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME',
        DefaultExecutablePermission='NEVER'
    )
    print("Default execution endpoint disabled successfully")
except ClientError as e:
    print("Error: ", e)
```

Note: Replace `YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME` with the name of your AWS Lambda function.

This will disable the default execution endpoint for your AWS Lambda function and remediate the misconfiguration.
