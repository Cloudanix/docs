<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the issue of expiring SSL client certificates for AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service.
3. Select the certificate that needs to be rotated.
4. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Renew certificate".
5. Follow the prompts to generate a new SSL client certificate.
6. Once the new certificate is generated, update all applications and services to use the new certificate.
7. Verify that the new certificate is working properly by testing all applications and services that use it.

That's it! By following these steps, you will have successfully remediated the issue of expiring SSL client certificates in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of expiring SSL client certificates that should be rotated in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the IAM users with expiring SSL client certificates:

```
aws iam list-users --query "Users[].[UserName,UserId,SSHPublicKeys[?SSHPublicKeyId==null]|[?SSHPublicKeyId==''],SSHPublicKeys[?SSHPublicKeyId!=null].[SSHPublicKeyId,Status,UploadDate,UserName]]" --output table
```

This command will list all the IAM users with expiring SSL client certificates.

3. Identify the IAM user(s) that need to rotate their SSL client certificates.

4. Run the following command to delete the expiring SSL client certificate(s) for the identified IAM user(s):

```
aws iam delete-ssh-public-key --user-name <IAM user name> --ssh-public-key-id <SSH public key ID>
```

Make sure to replace `<IAM user name>` and `<SSH public key ID>` with the actual values.

5. Run the following command to upload a new SSL client certificate for the identified IAM user(s):

```
aws iam upload-ssh-public-key --user-name <IAM user name> --ssh-public-key-body <SSH public key>
```

Make sure to replace `<IAM user name>` and `<SSH public key>` with the actual values.

6. Verify that the new SSL client certificate has been uploaded successfully by running the following command:

```
aws iam list-ssh-public-keys --user-name <IAM user name> --query "SSHPublicKeys[].[SSHPublicKeyId,Status,UploadDate,UserName]" --output table
```

Make sure to replace `<IAM user name>` with the actual value.

7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 for all the IAM users with expiring SSL client certificates.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of expiring SSL client certificates that should be rotated in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of expiring SSL client certificates that should be rotated in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to identify the SSL client certificates that are going to expire soon. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to get the information about the SSL client certificates. The following code snippet can be used to retrieve the SSL client certificates:

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

client = boto3.client('iam')

# Get the list of SSL client certificates
ssl_certs = client.list_server_certificates()['ServerCertificateMetadataList']

# Get the current date and time
now = datetime.now()

# Define the threshold for expiration
expiration_threshold = timedelta(days=30)

# Loop through the SSL client certificates and check if they are going to expire soon
for cert in ssl_certs:
    expiration_date = cert['Expiration']
    if (expiration_date - now) < expiration_threshold:
        print(f"The SSL client certificate {cert['ServerCertificateName']} is going to expire soon.")
```

2. Once you have identified the SSL client certificates that are going to expire soon, you need to rotate them. To rotate the SSL client certificates, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('iam')

# Get the list of SSL client certificates
ssl_certs = client.list_server_certificates()['ServerCertificateMetadataList']

# Loop through the SSL client certificates and rotate them
for cert in ssl_certs:
    certificate_name = cert['ServerCertificateName']
    client.rotate_server_certificate(ServerCertificateName=certificate_name)
    print(f"The SSL client certificate {certificate_name} has been rotated.")
```

3. Finally, you can schedule a job to run this Python script periodically to ensure that the SSL client certificates are rotated before they expire. You can use AWS Lambda or any other scheduling service to run the script on a scheduled basis.

Note: Before running the script, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the SSL client certificates in AWS IAM.
