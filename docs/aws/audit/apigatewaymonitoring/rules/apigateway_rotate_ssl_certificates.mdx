How to rotate an SSL client certificate that is about to expire?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Generate a new SSL client certificate:
   - Generate a new SSL client certificate using a certificate authority (CA) or a certificate management tool.
   - Make sure the new certificate meets the required security and validity requirements.
2. Update the SSL client certificate in the application or service:
   - Identify the application or service that uses the SSL client certificate.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Expiring SSL Client Certificates Should Be Rotated" Policy.)
   - Replace the old certificate with the newly generated certificate.
   - Update the configuration or settings in the application or service to use the new certificate.
3. Test the updated SSL client certificate:
   - Verify that the updated SSL client certificate is working correctly by testing the application or service that uses it.
   - Perform thorough testing to ensure that the certificate rotation hasn't introduced any issues or disruptions.
4. Revoke or decommission the old SSL client certificate:
   - Once the new SSL client certificate is successfully deployed and tested, consider revoking or decommissioning the old certificate to ensure it is no longer used.
   - This step helps maintain proper security and avoids using expired or compromised certificates.
