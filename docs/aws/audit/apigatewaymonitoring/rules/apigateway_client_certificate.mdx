### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent API Gateway APIs from not using SSL certificates in AWS using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to API Gateway:**
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - In the Services menu, select "API Gateway" under the "Networking & Content Delivery" section.

2. **Select Your API:**
   - In the API Gateway console, select the API you want to configure from the list of APIs.

3. **Configure Custom Domain Names:**
   - In the left-hand navigation pane, select "Custom domain names."
   - Click on "Create Custom Domain Name."
   - Enter the domain name and choose the appropriate endpoint configuration (Regional or Edge-Optimized).
   - Upload your SSL/TLS certificate by selecting "Choose File" for the certificate body, private key, and certificate chain.

4. **Associate API with Custom Domain:**
   - After creating the custom domain name, go back to the "Custom domain names" section.
   - Select the custom domain name you created.
   - Click on "Add Mapping" to map the custom domain name to your API stage.
   - Select the API and the stage (e.g., prod) you want to associate with the custom domain name.

By following these steps, you ensure that your API Gateway APIs are using SSL certificates, thereby securing the communication between clients and your API.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To ensure that API Gateway APIs use SSL certificates in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS CLI:

1. **Create a Custom Domain Name with an SSL Certificate:**
   - First, you need to create a custom domain name and associate it with an SSL certificate. This ensures that your API Gateway uses HTTPS.
   ```sh
   aws apigateway create-domain-name --domain-name <your-custom-domain> --certificate-arn <your-certificate-arn>
   ```

2. **Create or Update an API Gateway Stage to Use the Custom Domain:**
   - Associate your API Gateway stage with the custom domain name you created.
   ```sh
   aws apigateway create-base-path-mapping --domain-name <your-custom-domain> --rest-api-id <your-rest-api-id> --stage <your-stage-name>
   ```

3. **Enable Endpoint Configuration to Use EDGE or REGIONAL:**
   - Ensure that your API Gateway endpoint configuration is set to `EDGE` or `REGIONAL`, which supports SSL by default.
   ```sh
   aws apigateway update-rest-api --rest-api-id <your-rest-api-id> --patch-operations op=replace,path=/endpointConfiguration/types,value=REGIONAL
   ```

4. **Verify the Custom Domain Name Configuration:**
   - Verify that the custom domain name is correctly configured and associated with your API Gateway.
   ```sh
   aws apigateway get-domain-name --domain-name <your-custom-domain>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your API Gateway APIs are configured to use SSL certificates, thereby enforcing secure communication over HTTPS.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To ensure that API Gateway APIs use SSL certificates in AWS, you can use the Boto3 library in Python. Below are the steps to prevent misconfigurations related to SSL certificates in API Gateway:

### Step 1: Install Boto3
First, ensure you have Boto3 installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

### Step 2: Create a Boto3 Client
Create a Boto3 client to interact with the API Gateway service.
```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('apigateway')
```

### Step 3: Create or Update API Gateway with SSL Certificate
When creating or updating an API Gateway, ensure that you specify the `endpointConfiguration` to use `REGIONAL` or `EDGE` endpoint types, which support SSL by default.

#### Example: Create a New API with SSL
```python
response = client.create_rest_api(
    name='MySecureAPI',
    description='API with SSL',
    endpointConfiguration={
        'types': ['REGIONAL']  # or 'EDGE'
    }
)
print(response)
```

#### Example: Update an Existing API to Use SSL
```python
api_id = 'your_api_id_here'

response = client.update_rest_api(
    restApiId=api_id,
    patchOperations=[
        {
            'op': 'replace',
            'path': '/endpointConfiguration/types',
            'value': 'REGIONAL'  # or 'EDGE'
        }
    ]
)
print(response)
```

### Step 4: Verify SSL Configuration
After creating or updating the API, you can verify that the endpoint configuration is set correctly.
```python
response = client.get_rest_api(
    restApiId='your_api_id_here'
)

print(response['endpointConfiguration'])
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your API Gateway APIs are configured to use SSL certificates, thereby preventing misconfigurations related to insecure endpoints.

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the API Gateway service by typing 'API Gateway' in the search bar and selecting it from the dropdown menu.
3. In the API Gateway dashboard, you will see a list of all your APIs. Select the API you want to check.
4. Once you've selected the API, navigate to the 'Custom Domain Names' section in the left-hand menu. Here, you can see if an SSL certificate is associated with your API. If there is no SSL certificate, or if it's expired, then it's a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the API Gateway services.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the APIs in the API Gateway by using the following command:

   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-apis
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the APIs in the API Gateway.

3. To check if an API is using SSL certificates, you need to get the details of each API. You can do this by using the following command:

   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-api --rest-api-id {rest-api-id}
   ```

   Replace `{rest-api-id}` with the ID of the API you want to check. This command will return the details of the specified API.

4. In the returned details, look for the `endpointConfiguration` field. If the `types` field under `endpointConfiguration` is set to `EDGE`, it means the API is using a CloudFront distribution and SSL certificates are managed by AWS. If the `types` field is set to `REGIONAL` or `PRIVATE`, you need to manually manage SSL certificates.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You will need the boto3 library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI. Run `aws configure` and then enter your access key, secret access key, and default region when prompted.

3. Python Script: Now you can use the following Python script to check if API Gateway APIs are using SSL certificates:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_api_gateway_ssl():
       client = boto3.client('apigateway')
       response = client.get_rest_apis()
       for api in response['items']:
           api_id = api['id']
           api_name = api['name']
           response = client.get_stages(restApiId=api_id)
           for stage in response['item']:
               if 'clientCertificateId' not in stage:
                   print(f"API Gateway '{api_name}' does not use SSL certificate.")
               else:
                   print(f"API Gateway '{api_name}' uses SSL certificate.")

   check_api_gateway_ssl()
   ```
   
   This script retrieves all the API Gateways and checks if they have a client certificate ID associated with them. If they don't, it means they are not using SSL certificates.

4. Run the Script: Finally, you can run the script using a Python interpreter. If any API Gateway is not using SSL certificates, it will be printed out. 

   Please note that this script only checks for the existence of a client certificate ID, not whether the certificate is valid or expired. You may need to add additional checks depending on your requirements.

7. Verify that the API is now using the SSL certificate by accessing the API using HTTPS.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "API Gateway APIs Should Use SSL Certificates" misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of API Gateway APIs not using SSL certificates in AWS, you can use the following steps using Python:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK libraries for Python, including `boto3` and `botocore`.

```
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Create a new `boto3` client for the API Gateway service.

```
api_gateway_client = boto3.client('apigateway')
```

3. Get a list of all APIs in the API Gateway service using the `get_rest_apis()` method.

```
api_list = api_gateway_client.get_rest_apis()
```

4. Loop through each API in the list and check if it has an SSL certificate attached to it using the `get_domain_name()` method.

```
for api in api_list['items']:
    api_id = api['id']
    try:
        domain_name = api_gateway_client.get_domain_name(restApiId=api_id)
        if domain_name['securityPolicy'] == 'TLS_1_0':
            # SSL certificate not attached, remediate the issue
            # ...
    except ClientError as e:
        # Handle any errors that occur during the API check
        print(e)
```

5. If the API does not have an SSL certificate attached, you can remediate the issue by creating a new SSL certificate using the AWS Certificate Manager service and attaching it to the API using the `create_domain_name()` and `update_domain_name()` methods.

```
# Create a new SSL certificate using AWS Certificate Manager
acm_client = boto3.client('acm')
certificate_arn = acm_client.request_certificate(
    DomainName='example.com',
    ValidationMethod='DNS'
)['CertificateArn']

# Attach the SSL certificate to the API using API Gateway
api_gateway_client.create_domain_name(
    domainName='example.com',
    certificateArn=certificate_arn,
    securityPolicy='TLS_1_2'
)

# Update the API Gateway API to use the new SSL certificate
api_gateway_client.update_domain_name(
    domainName='example.com',
    patchOperations=[
        {
            'op': 'replace',
            'path': '/certificateArn',
            'value': certificate_arn
        }
    ]
)
```

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each API that does not have an SSL certificate attached.

Note: Make sure to replace the `DomainName` parameter in step 5 with the actual domain name of your API.
