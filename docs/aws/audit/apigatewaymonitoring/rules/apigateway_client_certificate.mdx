How to generate an SSL certificate and associate it with your Amazon API Gateway?

#### Using AWS Console.

1. Request an SSL certificate:
   - You can request an SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to provision a new SSL certificate.
2. Import the SSL certificate to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):
   - If you are using an SSL certificate from a third-party CA, import it to ACM. Skip this step if you are using ACM to provision the certificate.
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
   - Click on "Import a certificate" and provide the necessary details, including the SSL certificate, private key, and any intermediate certificates.
3. Associate the SSL certificate with your API Gateway:
   - Open the Amazon API Gateway console.
   - Select the API for which you want to enable SSL.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "API Gateway APIs Should Use SSL Certificates" Policy.)
   - In the left navigation pane, choose "Custom domain names."
   - Click on "Create Custom Domain Name" or select an existing custom domain name.
   - Under "Security," choose the ACM certificate you imported or provisioned earlier from the drop-down list.
   - Configure other options such as the domain name, base path mapping, and endpoint configuration as needed.
   - Click on "Save" to associate the SSL certificate with your API Gateway.
4. Set up DNS:
   - After associating the SSL certificate with your API Gateway, you need to set up DNS to route traffic to the custom domain name you configured. This involves creating a CNAME record in your DNS provider's settings pointing to the API Gateway domain name.
