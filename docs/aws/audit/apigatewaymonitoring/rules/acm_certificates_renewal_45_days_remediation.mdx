### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of AWS ACM Certificates renewal under 45 days, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service.
2. Select the certificate that needs to be renewed and click on the "Renew" button.
3. Select the duration for which you want to renew the certificate. Make sure to select a duration that is greater than 45 days.
4. Review the details of the certificate and click on the "Renew" button to proceed.
5. After renewing the certificate, update the certificate in all the resources where it is being used, such as Elastic Load Balancers, CloudFront distributions, and API Gateway endpoints.
6. Finally, set up a reminder or automation to renew the certificate before it expires again to avoid any future misconfigurations.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of AWS ACM Certificates renewal under 45 days and ensure that your certificates are always up-to-date and secure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of AWS ACM Certificates renewal under 45 days using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Check the expiration date of the certificate using the following command:

   `aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate_arn>`

   Replace `<certificate_arn>` with the ARN of the certificate that needs to be checked.

3. If the certificate expiration date is less than 45 days, you need to renew the certificate. To renew the certificate, use the following command:

   `aws acm renew-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate_arn>`

   Replace `<certificate_arn>` with the ARN of the certificate that needs to be renewed.

4. After renewing the certificate, you need to update the certificate in your application or load balancer. To do this, follow the below steps:

   a. Export the renewed certificate using the following command:

      `aws acm export-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate_arn> --passphrase <passphrase> --output text > certificate.pem`

      Replace `<certificate_arn>` with the ARN of the renewed certificate, and `<passphrase>` with a passphrase to encrypt the private key.

   b. Update the certificate in your application or load balancer using the exported certificate file.

5. Once the certificate is updated, verify if the certificate is renewed by checking the expiration date using the following command:

   `aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate_arn>`

   Replace `<certificate_arn>` with the ARN of the renewed certificate.

6. If the certificate is renewed successfully, the expiration date will be extended and the misconfiguration will be remediated.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to perform the above actions using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of AWS ACM certificates renewal under 45 days using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Install the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) using pip command.

```
pip install boto3
```

Step 2: Create a boto3 client for AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) using the following code:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('acm')
```

Step 3: Use the `list_certificates` method of the ACM client to get a list of all the certificates in your account.

```python
response = client.list_certificates()
```

Step 4: Loop through the list of certificates and check the expiration date of each certificate using the `describe_certificate` method of the ACM client.

```python
for cert in response['CertificateSummaryList']:
    cert_arn = cert['CertificateArn']
    cert_info = client.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
    expiration_date = cert_info['Certificate']['NotAfter']
```

Step 5: If the expiration date is less than 45 days from the current date, then use the `renew_certificate` method of the ACM client to renew the certificate.

```python
if (expiration_date - datetime.datetime.now()).days < 45:
    client.renew_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
```

Step 6: Run the Python script on a regular basis using a scheduler like cron to check for certificates that need to be renewed.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to renew certificates in your AWS account.
