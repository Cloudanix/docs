### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent AWS ACM Certificates from being within 7 days of expiration in API Gateway using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Monitor Certificate Expiration:**
   - Navigate to the **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** in the AWS Management Console.
   - Check the expiration dates of your certificates regularly. You can set up a CloudWatch alarm to notify you when a certificate is approaching its expiration date.

2. **Enable Automatic Renewal:**
   - Ensure that your ACM certificates are set to automatically renew. ACM automatically renews certificates that are in use with other AWS services, such as API Gateway, as long as the domain validation is still valid.

3. **Update API Gateway with New Certificates:**
   - Go to the **API Gateway** service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Select the API that uses the ACM certificate.
   - Under the **Custom Domain Names** section, ensure that the domain name is associated with the correct, automatically renewing ACM certificate.

4. **Set Up Notifications:**
   - Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to set up alarms and notifications for certificate expiration.
   - Create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers an Amazon SNS notification when a certificate is within a certain number of days from expiration (e.g., 30 days). This will give you ample time to address any issues before the 7-day mark.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your ACM certificates are renewed well before they are within 7 days of expiration, thus preventing any potential disruptions in your API Gateway services.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent AWS ACM Certificates from being within 7 days of expiration in API Gateway using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **List All Certificates:**
   Use the AWS CLI to list all ACM certificates and their expiration dates. This helps you identify certificates that are nearing expiration.
   ```sh
   aws acm list-certificates --query "CertificateSummaryList[*].{CertificateArn:CertificateArn,DomainName:DomainName,NotAfter:NotAfter}"
   ```

2. **Describe Certificate Details:**
   For each certificate, get detailed information including the expiration date.
   ```sh
   aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn>
   ```

3. **Monitor Expiration Dates:**
   Implement a monitoring script or use AWS CloudWatch to set up an alarm for certificates that are within 30 days of expiration. This can be done using a combination of AWS CLI and CloudWatch.
   ```sh
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name "ACM-Certificate-Expiration" --metric-name "DaysToExpiry" --namespace "AWS/ACM" --statistic "Minimum" --period 86400 --threshold 30 --comparison-operator "LessThanThreshold" --dimensions Name=CertificateArn,Value=<certificate-arn> --evaluation-periods 1 --alarm-actions <sns-topic-arn>
   ```

4. **Automate Certificate Renewal:**
   Use AWS CLI to request a new certificate and update the API Gateway with the new certificate ARN before the old one expires.
   ```sh
   aws acm request-certificate --domain-name <your-domain-name> --validation-method DNS
   aws apigateway update-domain-name --domain-name <your-domain-name> --patch-operations op=replace,path=/certificateArn,value=<new-certificate-arn>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your ACM certificates are renewed well before they are within 7 days of expiration, thus preventing any potential disruptions in your API Gateway services.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent AWS ACM Certificates from being within 7 days of expiration in API Gateway using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)**
Ensure you have Boto3 installed and configured with the necessary permissions to access ACM and API Gateway.

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### 2. **List ACM Certificates**
Create a Python script to list all ACM certificates and check their expiration dates.

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize a session using Amazon ACM
acm_client = boto3.client('acm')

# Get the current date
current_date = datetime.utcnow()

# List all ACM certificates
certificates = acm_client.list_certificates()

# Check each certificate's expiration date
for cert in certificates['CertificateSummaryList']:
    cert_details = acm_client.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=cert['CertificateArn'])
    expiration_date = cert_details['Certificate']['NotAfter']
    
    # Calculate the difference in days
    days_to_expire = (expiration_date - current_date).days
    
    if days_to_expire < 7:
        print(f"Certificate {cert['CertificateArn']} is expiring in {days_to_expire} days.")
```

### 3. **Automate Certificate Renewal**
If a certificate is found to be expiring within 7 days, automate the renewal process.

```python
# Function to renew a certificate
def renew_certificate(cert_arn):
    response = acm_client.renew_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
    return response

# Renew certificates that are expiring within 7 days
for cert in certificates['CertificateSummaryList']:
    cert_details = acm_client.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=cert['CertificateArn'])
    expiration_date = cert_details['Certificate']['NotAfter']
    days_to_expire = (expiration_date - current_date).days
    
    if days_to_expire < 7:
        renew_response = renew_certificate(cert['CertificateArn'])
        print(f"Renewed certificate {cert['CertificateArn']}: {renew_response}")
```

### 4. **Update API Gateway with New Certificate**
After renewing the certificate, update the API Gateway to use the new certificate.

```python
# Initialize a session using Amazon API Gateway
apigateway_client = boto3.client('apigateway')

# Function to update API Gateway with new certificate
def update_api_gateway(domain_name, new_cert_arn):
    response = apigateway_client.update_domain_name(
        domainName=domain_name,
        patchOperations=[
            {
                'op': 'replace',
                'path': '/certificateArn',
                'value': new_cert_arn
            }
        ]
    )
    return response

# Example: Update API Gateway with the new certificate
domain_name = 'example.com'  # Replace with your domain name
new_cert_arn = 'arn:aws:acm:region:account-id:certificate/new-certificate-id'  # Replace with your new certificate ARN
update_response = update_api_gateway(domain_name, new_cert_arn)
print(f"Updated API Gateway for domain {domain_name} with new certificate: {update_response}")
```

### Summary
1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)**: Install and configure Boto3.
2. **List ACM Certificates**: Create a script to list and check expiration dates.
3. **Automate Certificate Renewal**: Renew certificates expiring within 7 days.
4. **Update API Gateway with New Certificate**: Update API Gateway to use the renewed certificate.

By following these steps, you can automate the process of preventing ACM certificates from expiring within 7 days in API Gateway using Python scripts.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the API Gateway service.
2. In the API Gateway dashboard, select the APIs that you want to examine.
3. In the API details page, select the "Stages" option from the left-hand navigation panel.
4. In the Stages section, check the "Client Certificate for Endpoint Verification" field. If the certificate is due to expire in less than 7 days, it is a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the ACM and API Gateway services.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the ACM Certificates using the following command:
   ```
   aws acm list-certificates --region your-region
   ```
   Replace 'your-region' with the region where your ACM Certificates are located. This command will return a list of Certificate ARNs.

3. For each Certificate ARN, you can describe the certificate to get its details, including the renewal status. Use the following command:
   ```
   aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn your-certificate-arn --region your-region
   ```
   Replace 'your-certificate-arn' with the ARN of the certificate you want to check, and 'your-region' with the region where the certificate is located. Look for the 'RenewalSummary' field in the output. If the 'RenewalStatus' is 'PENDING_VALIDATION', it means the certificate is due for renewal.

4. To check if the certificate is used in API Gateway, list all the Rest APIs in API Gateway using the following command:
   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-apis --region your-region
   ```
   For each Rest API, get its details using the following command:
   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-api --rest-api-id your-rest-api-id --region your-region
   ```
   Replace 'your-rest-api-id' with the ID of the Rest API you want to check, and 'your-region' with the region where the Rest API is located. If the 'endpointConfiguration' field contains the ARN of the certificate, it means the certificate is used in the Rest API.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install Boto3 in your local environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing Boto3, you need to configure it. You can configure it using AWS CLI:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   It will ask for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format. You can get these details from your AWS account.

2. Use Boto3 to list all the ACM Certificates:
   You can use the `list_certificates` method of ACM client in Boto3 to list all the ACM Certificates. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create ACM client
   acm = boto3.client('acm')

   # List certificates with the pagination interface
   paginator = acm.get_paginator('list_certificates')
   for response in paginator.paginate():
       for certificate in response['CertificateSummaryList']:
           print(certificate)
   ```
   This script will print all the ACM Certificates in your AWS account.

3. Check the renewal status of each certificate:
   You can use the `describe_certificate` method of ACM client in Boto3 to get the details of each certificate. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Create ACM client
   acm = boto3.client('acm')

   # List certificates with the pagination interface
   paginator = acm.get_paginator('list_certificates')
   for response in paginator.paginate():
       for certificate in response['CertificateSummaryList']:
           # Describe the specified certificate
           response = acm.describe_certificate(
               CertificateArn=certificate['CertificateArn']
           )
           # Get the renewal eligibility
           renewal_eligibility = response['Certificate']['RenewalEligibility']
           # Get the not_after date
           not_after = response['Certificate']['NotAfter']
           # Check if the certificate is eligible for renewal and will expire in less than 7 days
           if renewal_eligibility == 'ELIGIBLE' and not_after < datetime.now() + timedelta(days=7):
               print(f"Certificate {certificate['CertificateArn']} is eligible for renewal and will expire in less than 7 days.")
   ```
   This script will print all the ACM Certificates in your AWS account that are eligible for renewal and will expire in less than 7 days.

4. Handle the exceptions:
   You should handle the exceptions in your script to make it robust. For example, you can handle the `NoCredentialsError` exception if the AWS credentials are not configured properly. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3
   from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   try:
       # Create ACM client
       acm = boto3.client('acm')

       # List certificates with the pagination interface
       paginator = acm.get_paginator('list_certificates')
       for response in paginator.paginate():
           for certificate in response['CertificateSummaryList']:
               # Describe the specified certificate
               response = acm.describe_certificate(
                   CertificateArn=certificate['CertificateArn']
               )
               # Get the renewal eligibility
               renewal_eligibility = response['Certificate']['RenewalEligibility']
               # Get the not_after date
               not_after = response['Certificate']['NotAfter']
               # Check if the certificate is eligible for renewal and will expire in less than 7 days
               if renewal_eligibility == 'ELIGIBLE' and not_after < datetime.now() + timedelta(days=7):
                   print(f"Certificate {certificate['CertificateArn']} is eligible for renewal and will expire in less than 7 days.")
   except NoCredentialsError:
       print("AWS credentials are not configured properly.")
   ```
   This script will print a message if the AWS credentials are not configured properly.

#
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The following are the step by step instructions on how to remediate the AWS ACM Certificates Renewal Under 7 Days misconfiguration using AWS CLI:

1. Open your AWS CLI and run the following command to list all the certificates in the us-east-1 region:

```
aws acm list-certificates --region us-east-1
```

2. Identify the certificate that needs to be renewed and make a note of its ARN.

3. Run the following command to check the expiration date of the certificate:

```
aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn> --region us-east-1
```

Replace `<certificate-arn>` with the ARN of the certificate that needs to be renewed.

4. If the certificate is expiring in less than 7 days, then it needs to be renewed. Run the following command to request a new certificate:

```
aws acm request-certificate --domain-name <domain-name> --validation-method DNS --region us-east-1
```

Replace `<domain-name>` with the domain name for which the certificate needs to be renewed.

5. Once the certificate is requested, it needs to be validated. Run the following command to get the CNAME record that needs to be added to the DNS configuration:

```
aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn> --region us-east-1 --query "Certificate.DomainValidationOptions[0].ResourceRecord" --output text
```

6. Add the CNAME record to the DNS configuration of the domain name.

7. Run the following command to confirm that the certificate is validated:

```
aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn> --region us-east-1 --query "Certificate.DomainValidationOptions[0].ValidationStatus" --output text
```

8. Once the certificate is validated, it can be used. Run the following command to update the certificate:

```
aws acm add-tags-to-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn> --tags Key=Name,Value=<certificate-name> --region us-east-1
```

Replace `<certificate-arn>` with the ARN of the new certificate and `<certificate-name>` with a name for the new certificate.

9. Finally, update the certificate in the application or service that is using it with the new certificate ARN.

These steps should remediate the AWS ACM Certificates Renewal Under 7 Days misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the AWS ACM Certificates Renewal Under 7 Days misconfiguration using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the required libraries: boto3, datetime

```
import boto3
import datetime
```

2. Create an AWS ACM client object:

```
acm_client = boto3.client('acm')
```

3. Get a list of all the ACM certificates:

```
certificates = acm_client.list_certificates()
```

4. Loop through each certificate and check if it is expiring in less than 7 days:

```
for certificate in certificates['CertificateSummaryList']:
    certificate_details = acm_client.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=certificate['CertificateArn'])
    expiry_date = certificate_details['Certificate']['NotAfter']
    days_left = (expiry_date - datetime.datetime.now()).days
    if days_left < 7:
        # Renew the certificate
        acm_client.renew_certificate(CertificateArn=certificate['CertificateArn'])
```

5. If a certificate is expiring in less than 7 days, renew it using the `renew_certificate` method of the ACM client object.

6. Save the Python file and run it periodically to check for expiring certificates and renew them automatically.

Note: Make sure to set up AWS credentials in the environment where you are running the Python script.
