### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of API Gateway Execution Logging not being enabled in AWS, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to API Gateway service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page, and then select "API Gateway" under the Networking & Content Delivery section.

3. **Select the API**: From the list of APIs, select the API for which you want to enable execution logging.

4. **Enable Execution Logging**:
   - In the API Gateway console, click on the "Stages" link on the left-hand side.
   - Select the stage for which you want to enable execution logging (e.g., "Prod").
   - Under the selected stage, click on the "Logs/Tracing" tab.
   - Click on the pencil icon next to "CloudWatch Settings" to edit the settings.
   - Check the box next to "Enable CloudWatch Logs" to enable execution logging.
   - Select the log level (INFO, ERROR, or OFF) based on your requirements.
   - Choose an existing IAM role or create a new IAM role that grants API Gateway permissions to write logs to CloudWatch Logs.
   - Click on the "Save Changes" button to save the configuration.

5. **Verify the Configuration**:
   - To verify that execution logging is enabled, you can make a test request to your API and check if the logs are being generated in CloudWatch Logs.
   - Go to the CloudWatch service in the AWS Management Console and navigate to the log group associated with your API Gateway.
   - Look for log entries related to the requests made to your API to confirm that execution logging is working correctly.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of API Gateway Execution Logging not being enabled in AWS using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of API Gateway Execution Logging not being enabled in AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. **Enable CloudWatch Logs for API Gateway:**
   
   Run the following AWS CLI command to enable CloudWatch Logs for API Gateway:
   
   ```bash
   aws apigateway update-usage-plan --usage-plan-id <usage-plan-id> --patch-operations op=replace,path=/apiStages/<api-id>/<stage>,value="{\"metricsEnabled\":true,\"loggingLevel\":\"INFO\",\"dataTraceEnabled\":true}"
   ```
   
   Replace `<usage-plan-id>` with the ID of the usage plan you want to update, `<api-id>` with the ID of the API you want to enable logging for, and `<stage>` with the stage of the API (e.g., `prod`).

2. **Verify the Configuration:**

   You can verify that the execution logging has been enabled by checking the API Gateway settings in the AWS Management Console or by running the following AWS CLI command:
   
   ```bash
   aws apigateway get-usage-plan --usage-plan-id <usage-plan-id>
   ```

   This command will return the details of the updated usage plan, and you can confirm that the `metricsEnabled`, `loggingLevel`, and `dataTraceEnabled` parameters are set to `true`.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of API Gateway Execution Logging not being enabled in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of API Gateway Execution Logging not being enabled in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary Python libraries:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Create a boto3 client for API Gateway:
```python
client = boto3.client('apigateway')
```

3. Get a list of APIs in API Gateway:
```python
apis = client.get_rest_apis()
```

4. Iterate through each API and enable execution logging:
```python
for api in apis['items']:
    api_id = api['id']
    response = client.update_stage(
        restApiId=api_id,
        stageName='your_stage_name', # Replace 'your_stage_name' with the name of your stage
        patchOperations=[
            {
                'op': 'replace',
                'path': '/logging/dataTrace',
                'value': 'true'
            },
            {
                'op': 'replace',
                'path': '/logging/loglevel',
                'value': 'INFO'
            }
        ]
    )
    print(f"Execution logging enabled for API: {api_id}")
```

5. Make sure to replace `'your_stage_name'` with the name of the stage for which you want to enable execution logging.

6. Run the Python script, and it will enable execution logging for all APIs in API Gateway.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of API Gateway Execution Logging not being enabled in AWS using Python.
