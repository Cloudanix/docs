<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent misconfigurations related to EFS (Elastic File System) encryption in AWS API Gateway using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create an EFS File System with Encryption Enabled:**
   Ensure that any new EFS file system you create has encryption enabled by default.

   ```sh
   aws efs create-file-system --creation-token <unique-token> --encrypted
   ```

2. **Verify Encryption Status of Existing EFS File Systems:**
   Regularly check the encryption status of your existing EFS file systems to ensure they are encrypted.

   ```sh
   aws efs describe-file-systems --query "FileSystems[*].{ID:FileSystemId,Encrypted:Encrypted}"
   ```

3. **Update API Gateway to Use Encrypted EFS:**
   When configuring API Gateway to use EFS, ensure that it references an encrypted EFS file system. This step is more about ensuring the correct setup rather than a direct CLI command, but you can verify the EFS ID used in your API Gateway configuration.

   ```sh
   aws apigateway get-rest-apis --query "items[*].{ID:id,name:name}"
   ```

4. **Automate Compliance Checks:**
   Use AWS Config to set up a rule that checks whether your EFS file systems are encrypted. This will help in maintaining compliance and preventing misconfigurations.

   ```sh
   aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule file://efs-encryption-enabled-rule.json
   ```

   Example `efs-encryption-enabled-rule.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "ConfigRuleName": "efs-encryption-enabled",
     "Description": "Checks whether EFS file systems are encrypted.",
     "Scope": {
       "ComplianceResourceTypes": [
         "AWS::EFS::FileSystem"
       ]
     },
     "Source": {
       "Owner": "AWS",
       "SourceIdentifier": "EFS_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED"
     }
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your EFS file systems used with API Gateway are encrypted, thereby preventing misconfigurations related to EFS encryption.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent misconfigurations related to EFS (Elastic File System) encryption in AWS API Gateway using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   - Ensure you have Boto3 installed and configured with the necessary permissions to interact with AWS services.

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script to Check EFS Encryption:**
   - Write a Python script that checks if the EFS is encrypted. If not, it should enable encryption.

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_and_enable_efs_encryption(efs_id):
       client = boto3.client('efs')
       response = client.describe_file_systems(
           FileSystemId=efs_id
       )
       file_system = response['FileSystems'][0]
       if not file_system['Encrypted']:
           print(f"EFS {efs_id} is not encrypted. Enabling encryption...")
           # Note: EFS encryption at rest can only be enabled at creation time.
           # You would need to create a new EFS with encryption enabled and migrate data.
           # This is a placeholder for the actual logic.
           # client.create_file_system(Encrypted=True, ...)
       else:
           print(f"EFS {efs_id} is already encrypted.")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       efs_id = 'your-efs-id'  # Replace with your EFS ID
       check_and_enable_efs_encryption(efs_id)
   ```

3. **Automate the Script Execution:**
   - Use AWS Lambda or a scheduled task to run the script periodically to ensure compliance.

   ```python
   import boto3
   import json

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       efs_id = event['efs_id']
       check_and_enable_efs_encryption(efs_id)

   def check_and_enable_efs_encryption(efs_id):
       client = boto3.client('efs')
       response = client.describe_file_systems(
           FileSystemId=efs_id
       )
       file_system = response['FileSystems'][0]
       if not file_system['Encrypted']:
           print(f"EFS {efs_id} is not encrypted. Enabling encryption...")
           # Note: EFS encryption at rest can only be enabled at creation time.
           # You would need to create a new EFS with encryption enabled and migrate data.
           # This is a placeholder for the actual logic.
           # client.create_file_system(Encrypted=True, ...)
       else:
           print(f"EFS {efs_id} is already encrypted.")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       efs_id = 'your-efs-id'  # Replace with your EFS ID
       check_and_enable_efs_encryption(efs_id)
   ```

4. **Integrate with CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Integrate the script into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that any new EFS created is checked for encryption.

   ```yaml
   # Example GitHub Actions workflow
   name: Check EFS Encryption

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     check-efs-encryption:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Set up Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v2
           with:
             python-version: '3.x'
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: |
             pip install boto3
         - name: Run script
           run: |
             python check_efs_encryption.py
           env:
             AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
             AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
             AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: 'us-west-2'
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your EFS is always encrypted, thereby preventing misconfigurations related to EFS encryption in AWS API Gateway.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon API Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose APIs. This will display a list of all your APIs.

3. Select the API you want to check. This will open the API Gateway dashboard for the selected API.

4. In the API Gateway dashboard, navigate to the "Settings" section. Here, look for the "Encryption" settings. If the "Encrypt Data at Rest" option is enabled, then EFS encryption is enabled for the API Gateway. If not, then EFS encryption is not enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all the API Gateways: Use the following command to list all the API Gateways in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-apis
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the Rest APIs in your AWS account.

3. Get the details of each API Gateway: For each API Gateway, use the following command to get its details:

   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-api --rest-api-id {rest-api-id}
   ```
   Replace `{rest-api-id}` with the ID of the API Gateway you want to check. This command will return the details of the specified API Gateway.

4. Check the EFS Encryption: Unfortunately, AWS API Gateway does not directly support EFS encryption. Therefore, you cannot check EFS encryption enabled in API Gateway using AWS CLI. However, you can check if the EFS file systems that your API Gateway may interact with are encrypted. Use the following command to list all your EFS file systems:

   ```
   aws efs describe-file-systems
   ```
   For each file system, check the `Encrypted` field in the output. If it is `true`, then the file system is encrypted. If it is `false`, then it is not encrypted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if EFS Encryption is enabled in API Gateway using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to directly interact with AWS services such as API Gateway. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the Boto3 library in Python:**
   Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. To use Boto3, you first need to import it.

   ```python
   import boto3
   ```

2. **Create a session using your AWS credentials:**
   You need to provide your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to Boto3 so it can interact with AWS services on your behalf. You can do this by creating a session.

   ```python
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2' # specify the region you are interested in
   )
   ```

3. **Create an API Gateway client:**
   Once you have a session, you can create a client for API Gateway. This client will provide you with methods to interact with API Gateway.

   ```python
   client = session.client('apigateway')
   ```

4. **Check if EFS Encryption is enabled:**
   Now you can use the client to retrieve information about your APIs and check if EFS Encryption is enabled. Here is a simple example:

   ```python
   response = client.get_rest_apis()

   for item in response['items']:
       if 'efsConfig' in item:
           if 'encryptionEnabled' in item['efsConfig']:
               if item['efsConfig']['encryptionEnabled']:
                   print(f"EFS Encryption is enabled for API {item['name']}")
               else:
                   print(f"EFS Encryption is not enabled for API {item['name']}")
           else:
               print(f"EFS Encryption is not enabled for API {item['name']}")
       else:
           print(f"EFS Encryption is not enabled for API {item['name']}")
   ```

   This script will print out whether EFS Encryption is enabled for each of your APIs.

Please note that this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to access API Gateway and retrieve information about your APIs. If you don't, you may need to adjust your IAM policies accordingly.

```
import boto3

# Create an EFS client
efs = boto3.client('efs')

# Set the EFS file system ID
file_system_id = 'fs-12345678'

# Disable encryption for the EFS file system
response = efs.modify_file_system(
    FileSystemId=file_system_id,
    Encrypted=False
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

Make sure to replace `fs-12345678` with the actual ID of the EFS file system that you want to remediate.
