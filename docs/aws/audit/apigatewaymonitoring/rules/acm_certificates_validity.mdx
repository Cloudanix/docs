### More Info:

Ensure that all the requests made during SSL/TLS certificate issue or renewal process are validated. These requests are managed within your account by the Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM), an AWS service that lets you provision, deploy and maintain SSL/TLS certificates for use with other AWS resources such as ELB load balancers, CloudFront distributions or APIs via Amazon API Gateway.

How to make sure ACM certificates are valid.

#### Using AWS Console

To ensure that ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) certificates are valid in AWS, you can use the following steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/

2. Select the AWS region where your ACM certificates are located from the region selector in the top-right corner of the console.

3. In the navigation menu, under "Security, Identity & Compliance", click on "Certificate Manager" to open the ACM console.

4. In the ACM console, you will see a list of your certificates. The status column indicates the current status of each certificate.

5. Look for certificates with a status other than "Issued" or "Expired". These certificates may require attention.

6. Click on a certificate to view its details and status.

7. In the certificate details page, you can find additional information about the certificate, including its expiration date and domain validation status.

8. If a certificate has expired or is about to expire, you will need to renew it. Click on the "Renew" button to initiate the renewal process. Follow the prompts to complete the renewal.

9. If a certificate is not yet issued or has an issue with domain validation, you may need to take steps to resolve the issue. Follow any guidance or instructions provided in the console to address the issue.

10. Monitor the status of your certificates regularly and take appropriate action when necessary. You can set up CloudWatch alarms or use AWS Config to automate the monitoring and alerting process.

By regularly checking the status of your ACM certificates and taking appropriate action, you can ensure that your certificates are valid and up to date, enabling secure communication for your AWS resources and applications.
