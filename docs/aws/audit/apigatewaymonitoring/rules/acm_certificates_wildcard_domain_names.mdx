### More Info:

Ensure that ACM single domain name certificates are used instead of wildcard certificates within your AWS account in order to follow security best practices and protect each domain/subdomain with its own unique private key. An AWS ACM wildcard certificate matches any first level subdomain or hostname in a domain. For example, a wildcard certificate issued for *.cloudconformity.com can protect both www.cloudconformity.com and images.cloudconformity.com.
