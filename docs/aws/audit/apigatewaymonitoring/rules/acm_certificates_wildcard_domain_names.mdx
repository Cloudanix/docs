### More Info:

Ensure that ACM single domain name certificates are used instead of wildcard certificates within your AWS account in order to follow security best practices and protect each domain/subdomain with its own unique private key. An AWS ACM wildcard certificate matches any first level subdomain or hostname in a domain. For example, a wildcard certificate issued for *.cloudconformity.com can protect both www.cloudconformity.com and images.cloudconformity.com.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
The misconfiguration of AWS ACM certificates with wildcard domain names can be remediated by following these steps using the AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service.
3. Click on the certificate that has a wildcard domain name misconfiguration.
4. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Delete" to delete the certificate.
5. Click on "Request a certificate" to create a new certificate.
6. In the "Add domain names" section, enter the domain name without the wildcard character.
7. Click on "Add another name" to add additional domain names if necessary.
8. Select the validation method to validate the domain ownership.
9. Click on "Review and request" to review the certificate request details.
10. Click on "Confirm and request" to submit the certificate request.
11. Once the certificate is issued, update the DNS records for the domain names to point to the new certificate.

By following these steps, the misconfiguration of AWS ACM certificates with wildcard domain names can be remediated.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The misconfiguration of AWS ACM Certificates with Wildcard Domain Names can be remediated by following these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open your terminal and install AWS CLI if it's not already installed.
2. Run the following command to list all the certificates in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws acm list-certificates
   ```

3. Identify the certificate that has a wildcard domain name and make a note of its ARN.
4. Run the following command to describe the certificate:

   ```
   aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn>
   ```

   Replace `<certificate-arn>` with the ARN of the certificate you noted in step 3.

5. Check if the certificate is associated with any AWS resources like an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or a CloudFront distribution. If yes, note down their ARNs as well.
6. Run the following command to delete the certificate:

   ```
   aws acm delete-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn>
   ```

   Replace `<certificate-arn>` with the ARN of the certificate you noted in step 3.

7. If the certificate was associated with any AWS resources, update them with a new certificate that does not have a wildcard domain name. You can create a new certificate using AWS ACM or import an existing certificate.
8. Once the new certificate is associated with all the required resources, the remediation is complete.

Note: Deleting a certificate may cause a brief outage for the associated resources. Make sure to plan the remediation during a maintenance window to minimize the impact on your users.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
The misconfiguration is related to AWS ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager) certificates with wildcard domain names. This misconfiguration occurs when an ACM certificate is created with a wildcard domain name, but the certificate is not associated with the appropriate resources.

To remediate this misconfiguration, you can use the following steps:

1. First, you need to identify the ACM certificates that have wildcard domain names and are not associated with the appropriate resources. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to achieve this.

```
import boto3

acm = boto3.client('acm')

response = acm.list_certificates(CertificateStatuses=['ISSUED'])

for certificate in response['CertificateSummaryList']:
    if certificate['DomainName'].startswith('*.'):
        certificate_arn = certificate['CertificateArn']
        response = acm.list_tags_for_certificate(CertificateArn=certificate_arn)
        tags = response['Tags']
        if 'Resource' not in [tag['Key'] for tag in tags]:
            print(f"Certificate {certificate_arn} is not associated with any resource.")
```

2. Once you have identified the ACM certificates that are not associated with the appropriate resources, you can associate them with the appropriate resources. For example, if you have an ACM certificate with a wildcard domain name "*.example.com", you can associate it with your Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) using the following code:

```
import boto3

acm = boto3.client('acm')
elbv2 = boto3.client('elbv2')

certificate_arn = 'arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'

response = elbv2.describe_load_balancers(Names=['my-load-balancer'])

load_balancer_arn = response['LoadBalancers'][0]['LoadBalancerArn']

response = acm.list_tags_for_certificate(CertificateArn=certificate_arn)
tags = response['Tags']

if 'Resource' not in [tag['Key'] for tag in tags]:
    acm.add_tags_to_certificate(
        CertificateArn=certificate_arn,
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'Resource',
                'Value': 'LoadBalancer'
            },
            {
                'Key': 'ResourceArn',
                'Value': load_balancer_arn
            }
        ]
    )
```

This code associates the ACM certificate with the ELB by adding two tags to the certificate: "Resource" with the value "LoadBalancer" and "ResourceArn" with the value of the ELB ARN.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration related to AWS ACM certificates with wildcard domain names.
