title: AWS ACM Certificates With Wildcard Domain Names
---

### More Info:

Ensure that ACM single domain name certificates are used instead of wildcard certificates within your AWS account in order to follow security best practices and protect each domain/subdomain with its own unique private key. An AWS ACM wildcard certificate matches any first level subdomain or hostname in a domain. For example, a wildcard certificate issued for *.cloudconformity.com can protect both www.cloudconformity.com and images.cloudconformity.com.

How to ensure that ACM single domain name certificates are used instead of wildcard certificates within your AWS account.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Access the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Console:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the ACM service.
2. Check for Existing Wildcard Certificates:
   - In the ACM console, click on the "Certificates" tab.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "AWS ACM Certificates With Wildcard Domain Names" Policy.)
   - Review the list of certificates and identify any wildcard certificates that are currently in use.
3. Replace Wildcard Certificates with Single Domain Certificates:
   - Identify the specific services or resources where the wildcard certificates are used.
   - Generate or obtain single domain certificates for each of those services or resources. You can request new certificates from ACM or import existing certificates.
   - Ensure that each single domain certificate includes the appropriate domain name(s) required for the specific service or resource.
4. Replace the Certificate in Each Service or Resource:
   - For each service or resource using a wildcard certificate, access the respective service's console or configuration settings.
   - Locate the SSL/TLS certificate configuration or option.
   - Update the certificate configuration to use the corresponding single domain certificate obtained in step 3.
   - Save or apply the changes.
5. Validate Certificate Configuration:
   - Test the services or resources that were updated to ensure that the new single domain certificates are being used correctly.
   - Check the SSL/TLS connections and verify that the correct domain names are secured by the certificates.
6. Delete Unused Wildcard Certificates:
   - Once you have confirmed that the services or resources are successfully using the single domain certificates, go back to the ACM console.
   - Locate the wildcard certificates that are no longer in use.
   - Select each unused wildcard certificate and click on the "Delete" button to remove them from ACM.
