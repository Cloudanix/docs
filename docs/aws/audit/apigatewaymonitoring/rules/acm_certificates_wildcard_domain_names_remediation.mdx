### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent the use of AWS ACM Certificates with wildcard domain names in API Gateway using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to API Gateway:**
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - In the Services menu, select "API Gateway" under the "Networking & Content Delivery" section.

2. **Select Your API:**
   - In the API Gateway console, select the API for which you want to configure the custom domain name.

3. **Configure Custom Domain Name:**
   - In the left-hand navigation pane, click on "Custom domain names."
   - Click on "Create Custom Domain Name" or select an existing custom domain name to edit.

4. **Specify Certificate:**
   - In the "Create Custom Domain Name" or "Edit Custom Domain Name" page, ensure that you select an ACM certificate that does not use a wildcard domain name. Instead, use a specific domain name certificate.
   - Save the changes by clicking on the "Save" or "Create" button.

By following these steps, you can ensure that only specific domain name certificates are used in API Gateway, thereby preventing the use of wildcard domain names.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the use of AWS ACM Certificates with wildcard domain names in API Gateway using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **List Existing Certificates**:
   First, identify all the ACM certificates in your account to check for any wildcard certificates.
   ```sh
   aws acm list-certificates --query "CertificateSummaryList[?DomainName=='*.example.com']"
   ```

2. **Describe Certificate**:
   If you find any wildcard certificates, describe them to get more details and ensure they are not used in API Gateway.
   ```sh
   aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn>
   ```

3. **List API Gateway Custom Domain Names**:
   List all custom domain names in API Gateway to check if any of them are using wildcard certificates.
   ```sh
   aws apigateway get-domain-names
   ```

4. **Update API Gateway Custom Domain Name**:
   If you find any custom domain names using wildcard certificates, update them to use a specific domain certificate instead.
   ```sh
   aws apigateway update-domain-name --domain-name <domain-name> --patch-operations op=replace,path=/certificateArn,value=<new-certificate-arn>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that wildcard domain names are not used in API Gateway, thereby preventing potential misconfigurations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the use of AWS ACM Certificates with wildcard domain names in API Gateway using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed and configured with the necessary permissions to interact with AWS ACM and API Gateway.

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **List ACM Certificates:**
   Use Boto3 to list all ACM certificates and filter out those with wildcard domain names.

   ```python
   import boto3

   acm_client = boto3.client('acm')

   def list_wildcard_certificates():
       paginator = acm_client.get_paginator('list_certificates')
       for page in paginator.paginate():
           for cert in page['CertificateSummaryList']:
               cert_details = acm_client.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=cert['CertificateArn'])
               domain_name = cert_details['Certificate']['DomainName']
               if domain_name.startswith('*.'):
                   yield cert['CertificateArn']

   wildcard_certs = list(list_wildcard_certificates())
   ```

3. **Check API Gateway Custom Domain Names:**
   Use Boto3 to list all custom domain names in API Gateway and check if any of them are using the wildcard certificates identified in the previous step.

   ```python
   apigateway_client = boto3.client('apigateway')

   def list_custom_domain_names():
       paginator = apigateway_client.get_paginator('get_domain_names')
       for page in paginator.paginate():
           for domain in page['items']:
               yield domain

   def check_wildcard_cert_usage():
       for domain in list_custom_domain_names():
           if 'certificateArn' in domain and domain['certificateArn'] in wildcard_certs:
               print(f"Custom domain {domain['domainName']} is using a wildcard certificate: {domain['certificateArn']}")

   check_wildcard_cert_usage()
   ```

4. **Prevent Future Use of Wildcard Certificates:**
   Implement a policy or automation to prevent the association of wildcard certificates with API Gateway custom domain names. This can be done by creating a Lambda function that triggers on certificate creation or domain name association events and checks for wildcard certificates.

   ```python
   import json

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       for record in event['Records']:
           if record['eventName'] == 'CreateCertificate':
               cert_arn = record['responseElements']['certificateArn']
               cert_details = acm_client.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
               domain_name = cert_details['Certificate']['DomainName']
               if domain_name.startswith('*.'):
                   raise Exception(f"Wildcard certificates are not allowed: {cert_arn}")

   # Example event structure for testing
   test_event = {
       "Records": [
           {
               "eventName": "CreateCertificate",
               "responseElements": {
                   "certificateArn": "arn:aws:acm:region:account-id:certificate/certificate-id"
               }
           }
       ]
   }

   lambda_handler(test_event, None)
   ```

By following these steps, you can prevent the use of wildcard domain names in AWS ACM certificates for API Gateway custom domain names using Python scripts.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the API Gateway dashboard. 

2. In the APIs list, select the API you want to check. 

3. In the API's settings, navigate to the "Custom Domain Names" section. Here, you will see a list of all custom domain names associated with your API.

4. Check the ACM Certificate column for each custom domain name. If a certificate has a wildcard (*) in its domain name, it means that the certificate is configured with a wildcard domain name.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the following command to list all the ACM Certificates:

   ```
   aws acm list-certificates --region your-region
   ```

   Replace 'your-region' with the region where your ACM Certificates are located. This command will return a list of all the ACM Certificates in the specified region.

3. To check if any of these certificates have wildcard domain names, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn your-certificate-arn --region your-region
   ```

   Replace 'your-certificate-arn' with the ARN of the certificate you want to check and 'your-region' with the region where the certificate is located. This command will return the details of the specified certificate.

4. In the output of the above command, look for the 'DomainName' field. If the value of this field starts with '*', then the certificate has a wildcard domain name. For example, a value of '*.example.com' indicates a wildcard domain name.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, configure your AWS credentials. You can configure your credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using AWS CLI.

2. **List ACM Certificates:**
   Use the `list_certificates` method provided by the ACM client in boto3 to list all the certificates. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_acm_certificates():
       acm_client = boto3.client('acm')
       response = acm_client.list_certificates()
       return response['CertificateSummaryList']

   certificates = list_acm_certificates()
   print(certificates)
   ```
   This script will print all the ACM certificates.

3. **Check for Wildcard Domain Names:**
   Now, iterate over the certificates and check if any certificate has a wildcard domain name. A wildcard domain name starts with "*.". Here is the updated script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_acm_certificates():
       acm_client = boto3.client('acm')
       response = acm_client.list_certificates()
       return response['CertificateSummaryList']

   def check_wildcard_domain(certificates):
       wildcard_certs = []
       for cert in certificates:
           if cert['DomainName'].startswith('*.'):
               wildcard_certs.append(cert)
       return wildcard_certs

   certificates = list_acm_certificates()
   wildcard_certs = check_wildcard_domain(certificates)
   print(wildcard_certs)
   ```
   This script will print all the ACM certificates with wildcard domain names.

4. **Check API Gateway for ACM Certificates:**
   Finally, check if any of the ACM certificates with wildcard domain names are used in API Gateway. Use the `get_rest_apis` method provided by the API Gateway client in boto3. Here is the final script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_acm_certificates():
       acm_client = boto3.client('acm')
       response = acm_client.list_certificates()
       return response['CertificateSummaryList']

   def check_wildcard_domain(certificates):
       wildcard_certs = []
       for cert in certificates:
           if cert['DomainName'].startswith('*.'):
               wildcard_certs.append(cert)
       return wildcard_certs

   def check_api_gateway(wildcard_certs):
       api_gateway_client = boto3.client('apigateway')
       response = api_gateway_client.get_rest_apis()
       for api in response['items']:
           if 'certificateId' in api and api['certificateId'] in [cert['CertificateArn'] for cert in wildcard_certs]:
               print(f"API Gateway {api['name']} is using ACM certificate with wildcard domain name")

   certificates = list_acm_certificates()
   wildcard_certs = check_wildcard_domain(certificates)
   check_api_gateway(wildcard_certs)
   ```
   This script will print the names of all API Gateways that are using ACM certificates with wildcard domain names.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The misconfiguration of AWS ACM Certificates with Wildcard Domain Names can be remediated by following these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open your terminal and install AWS CLI if it's not already installed.
2. Run the following command to list all the certificates in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws acm list-certificates
   ```

3. Identify the certificate that has a wildcard domain name and make a note of its ARN.
4. Run the following command to describe the certificate:

   ```
   aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn>
   ```

   Replace `<certificate-arn>` with the ARN of the certificate you noted in step 3.

5. Check if the certificate is associated with any AWS resources like an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or a CloudFront distribution. If yes, note down their ARNs as well.
6. Run the following command to delete the certificate:

   ```
   aws acm delete-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn>
   ```

   Replace `<certificate-arn>` with the ARN of the certificate you noted in step 3.

7. If the certificate was associated with any AWS resources, update them with a new certificate that does not have a wildcard domain name. You can create a new certificate using AWS ACM or import an existing certificate.
8. Once the new certificate is associated with all the required resources, the remediation is complete.

Note: Deleting a certificate may cause a brief outage for the associated resources. Make sure to plan the remediation during a maintenance window to minimize the impact on your users.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
The misconfiguration is related to AWS ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager) certificates with wildcard domain names. This misconfiguration occurs when an ACM certificate is created with a wildcard domain name, but the certificate is not associated with the appropriate resources.

To remediate this misconfiguration, you can use the following steps:

1. First, you need to identify the ACM certificates that have wildcard domain names and are not associated with the appropriate resources. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to achieve this.

```
import boto3

acm = boto3.client('acm')

response = acm.list_certificates(CertificateStatuses=['ISSUED'])

for certificate in response['CertificateSummaryList']:
    if certificate['DomainName'].startswith('*.'):
        certificate_arn = certificate['CertificateArn']
        response = acm.list_tags_for_certificate(CertificateArn=certificate_arn)
        tags = response['Tags']
        if 'Resource' not in [tag['Key'] for tag in tags]:
            print(f"Certificate {certificate_arn} is not associated with any resource.")
```

2. Once you have identified the ACM certificates that are not associated with the appropriate resources, you can associate them with the appropriate resources. For example, if you have an ACM certificate with a wildcard domain name "*.example.com", you can associate it with your Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) using the following code:

```
import boto3

acm = boto3.client('acm')
elbv2 = boto3.client('elbv2')

certificate_arn = 'arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'

response = elbv2.describe_load_balancers(Names=['my-load-balancer'])

load_balancer_arn = response['LoadBalancers'][0]['LoadBalancerArn']

response = acm.list_tags_for_certificate(CertificateArn=certificate_arn)
tags = response['Tags']

if 'Resource' not in [tag['Key'] for tag in tags]:
    acm.add_tags_to_certificate(
        CertificateArn=certificate_arn,
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'Resource',
                'Value': 'LoadBalancer'
            },
            {
                'Key': 'ResourceArn',
                'Value': load_balancer_arn
            }
        ]
    )
```

This code associates the ACM certificate with the ELB by adding two tags to the certificate: "Resource" with the value "LoadBalancer" and "ResourceArn" with the value of the ELB ARN.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration related to AWS ACM certificates with wildcard domain names.
