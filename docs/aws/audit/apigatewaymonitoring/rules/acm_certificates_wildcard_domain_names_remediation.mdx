### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the API Gateway dashboard. 

2. In the APIs list, select the API you want to check. 

3. In the API's settings, navigate to the "Custom Domain Names" section. Here, you will see a list of all custom domain names associated with your API.

4. Check the ACM Certificate column for each custom domain name. If a certificate has a wildcard (*) in its domain name, it means that the certificate is configured with a wildcard domain name.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the ACM Certificates using the following command:

   ```
   aws acm list-certificates --region your-region
   ```
   Replace 'your-region' with the region where your ACM Certificates are located. This command will return a list of all the ACM Certificates in the specified region.

3. To check if any of these certificates have wildcard domain names, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn your-certificate-arn --region your-region
   ```
   Replace 'your-certificate-arn' with the ARN of the certificate you want to check and 'your-region' with the region where the certificate is located. This command will return the details of the specified certificate.

4. You can then parse the output of the above command to check if the 'DomainName' field contains a wildcard character ('*'). If it does, then the certificate has a wildcard domain name. You can use a tool like 'jq' to parse the JSON output, or you can write a Python script to do this. Here is a simple Python script that checks if a given domain name is a wildcard:

   ```python
   import json

   # Load the output of the 'describe-certificate' command
   with open('output.json') as f:
       data = json.load(f)

   # Check if the 'DomainName' field contains a wildcard character
   if '*' in data['Certificate']['DomainName']:
       print('The certificate has a wildcard domain name.')
   else:
       print('The certificate does not have a wildcard domain name.')
   ```
   Replace 'output.json' with the path to the file containing the output of the 'describe-certificate' command.

#### Using Python

1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, configure your AWS credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using the AWS CLI.

2. **List ACM Certificates:**
   Use the `list_certificates` method from the `boto3` client for ACM to get a list of all ACM certificates. Here is a sample Python script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_acm_certificates():
       acm_client = boto3.client('acm')
       response = acm_client.list_certificates()
       return response['CertificateSummaryList']

   certificates = list_acm_certificates()
   print(certificates)
   ```
   This script will print a list of all ACM certificates.

3. **Check for Wildcard Domain Names:**
   Iterate over the list of certificates and check if the domain name starts with '*'. If it does, it's a wildcard domain name. Here is a sample Python script:

   ```python
   def check_wildcard_certificates(certificates):
       wildcard_certificates = [cert for cert in certificates if cert['DomainName'].startswith('*')]
       return wildcard_certificates

   wildcard_certificates = check_wildcard_certificates(certificates)
   print(wildcard_certificates)
   ```
   This script will print a list of all ACM certificates with wildcard domain names.

4. **Check API Gateway for ACM Certificates:**
   Use the `get_domain_names` method from the `boto3` client for API Gateway to get a list of all domain names. Then, check if any of these domain names use the wildcard ACM certificates. Here is a sample Python script:

   ```python
   def check_api_gateway(certificates):
       apigateway_client = boto3.client('apigateway')
       response = apigateway_client.get_domain_names()
       for domain in response['items']:
           if 'certificateName' in domain:
               for cert in certificates:
                   if cert['CertificateArn'] == domain['certificateArn']:
                       print(f"API Gateway domain {domain['domainName']} is using wildcard ACM certificate {cert['DomainName']}")

   check_api_gateway(wildcard_certificates)
   ```
   This script will print all API Gateway domains that are using wildcard ACM certificates.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

The misconfiguration of AWS ACM certificates with wildcard domain names can be remediated by following these steps using the AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service.
3. Click on the certificate that has a wildcard domain name misconfiguration.
4. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Delete" to delete the certificate.
5. Click on "Request a certificate" to create a new certificate.
6. In the "Add domain names" section, enter the domain name without the wildcard character.
7. Click on "Add another name" to add additional domain names if necessary.
8. Select the validation method to validate the domain ownership.
9. Click on "Review and request" to review the certificate request details.
10. Click on "Confirm and request" to submit the certificate request.
11. Once the certificate is issued, update the DNS records for the domain names to point to the new certificate.

By following these steps, the misconfiguration of AWS ACM certificates with wildcard domain names can be remediated.

#### Using CLI

The misconfiguration of AWS ACM Certificates with Wildcard Domain Names can be remediated by following these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open your terminal and install AWS CLI if it's not already installed.
2. Run the following command to list all the certificates in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws acm list-certificates
   ```

3. Identify the certificate that has a wildcard domain name and make a note of its ARN.
4. Run the following command to describe the certificate:

   ```
   aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn>
   ```

   Replace `<certificate-arn>` with the ARN of the certificate you noted in step 3.

5. Check if the certificate is associated with any AWS resources like an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or a CloudFront distribution. If yes, note down their ARNs as well.
6. Run the following command to delete the certificate:

   ```
   aws acm delete-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn>
   ```

   Replace `<certificate-arn>` with the ARN of the certificate you noted in step 3.

7. If the certificate was associated with any AWS resources, update them with a new certificate that does not have a wildcard domain name. You can create a new certificate using AWS ACM or import an existing certificate.
8. Once the new certificate is associated with all the required resources, the remediation is complete.

Note: Deleting a certificate may cause a brief outage for the associated resources. Make sure to plan the remediation during a maintenance window to minimize the impact on your users.

#### Using Python

The misconfiguration is related to AWS ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager) certificates with wildcard domain names. This misconfiguration occurs when an ACM certificate is created with a wildcard domain name, but the certificate is not associated with the appropriate resources.

To remediate this misconfiguration, you can use the following steps:

1. First, you need to identify the ACM certificates that have wildcard domain names and are not associated with the appropriate resources. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to achieve this.

```
import boto3

acm = boto3.client('acm')

response = acm.list_certificates(CertificateStatuses=['ISSUED'])

for certificate in response['CertificateSummaryList']:
    if certificate['DomainName'].startswith('*.'):
        certificate_arn = certificate['CertificateArn']
        response = acm.list_tags_for_certificate(CertificateArn=certificate_arn)
        tags = response['Tags']
        if 'Resource' not in [tag['Key'] for tag in tags]:
            print(f"Certificate {certificate_arn} is not associated with any resource.")
```

2. Once you have identified the ACM certificates that are not associated with the appropriate resources, you can associate them with the appropriate resources. For example, if you have an ACM certificate with a wildcard domain name "*.example.com", you can associate it with your Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) using the following code:

```
import boto3

acm = boto3.client('acm')
elbv2 = boto3.client('elbv2')

certificate_arn = 'arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'

response = elbv2.describe_load_balancers(Names=['my-load-balancer'])

load_balancer_arn = response['LoadBalancers'][0]['LoadBalancerArn']

response = acm.list_tags_for_certificate(CertificateArn=certificate_arn)
tags = response['Tags']

if 'Resource' not in [tag['Key'] for tag in tags]:
    acm.add_tags_to_certificate(
        CertificateArn=certificate_arn,
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'Resource',
                'Value': 'LoadBalancer'
            },
            {
                'Key': 'ResourceArn',
                'Value': load_balancer_arn
            }
        ]
    )
```

This code associates the ACM certificate with the ELB by adding two tags to the certificate: "Resource" with the value "LoadBalancer" and "ResourceArn" with the value of the ELB ARN.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration related to AWS ACM certificates with wildcard domain names.
