### Remediation

#### Using Console

The issue with AWS ACM Certificates with Wildcard Domain Names is that it is not possible to issue a certificate for a domain name that contains only a wildcard character. To remediate this, you will need to follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) service.

2. Click on the "Request a certificate" button.

3. In the "Add domain names" section, enter the domain name for which you want to request a certificate. Do not use a wildcard character.

4. Select the validation method for your certificate. You can choose between email validation or DNS validation.

5. Follow the instructions provided to complete the validation process.

6. Once your certificate is issued, you can use it on any AWS service that supports SSL/TLS certificates.

7. If you need to secure multiple subdomains, you can request a wildcard certificate for the parent domain and then use it on all the subdomains.

Note: If you have already requested a certificate with a wildcard domain name, you will need to revoke it and request a new certificate without the wildcard character.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of AWS ACM certificates with wildcard domain names, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Use the `aws acm list-certificates` command to list all the certificates in your AWS account.

3. Identify the certificate with the wildcard domain name that needs to be remediated.

4. Use the `aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn>` command to get more details about the certificate.

5. Verify that the certificate is indeed a wildcard certificate.

6. Use the `aws acm request-certificate --domain-name <domain-name> --validation-method DNS` command to request a new certificate for the domain name.

7. Follow the instructions provided by AWS to complete the DNS validation process.

8. Once the validation process is complete, use the `aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <new-certificate-arn>` command to get the ARN of the new certificate.

9. Use the `aws acm delete-certificate --certificate-arn <old-certificate-arn>` command to delete the old certificate.

10. Use the `aws acm add-tags-to-certificate --certificate-arn <new-certificate-arn> --tags Key=<tag-key>,Value=<tag-value>` command to add any necessary tags to the new certificate.

11. Update any references to the old certificate with the ARN of the new certificate.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of AWS ACM certificates with wildcard domain names.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of AWS ACM certificates with wildcard domain names using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Identify the wildcard certificates in your AWS account using the Boto3 library in Python.

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('acm')

response = client.list_certificates(
    CertificateStatuses=[
        'ISSUED',
    ],
)

for certificate in response['CertificateSummaryList']:
    if certificate['DomainName'].startswith('*.'):
        print(certificate['CertificateArn'])
```

2. Update the wildcard certificate with a non-wildcard domain name using the `update_certificate_options` method.

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('acm')

response = client.list_certificates(
    CertificateStatuses=[
        'ISSUED',
    ],
)

for certificate in response['CertificateSummaryList']:
    if certificate['DomainName'].startswith('*.'):
        response = client.update_certificate_options(
            CertificateArn=certificate['CertificateArn'],
            Options={
                'CertificateTransparencyLoggingPreference': 'ENABLED',
                'DomainName': 'example.com',
            }
        )
```

3. Verify the updated certificate in the AWS console.

Note: Before making any changes, it's always recommended to take a backup of the existing certificates.
