title: Active Tracing Should Be Enabled For API Gateway Stages
---

### More Info:

Active tracing should be enabled for your Amazon API Gateway API stages to sample incoming requests and send traces to AWS X-Ray. Then X-Ray can provide you an end-to-end view of an entire HTTP request, so you can analyze latencies in your APIs and their backend services.

How to ensure tracing is enabled for API Gateway API stages?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Access the API Gateway Console:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the API Gateway service.
2. Select the API and Stage:
   - In the API Gateway console, select the API for which you want to enable tracing.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Active Tracing Should Be Enabled For API Gateway Stages" Policy.)
   - Choose the desired stage where you want to enable tracing (e.g., "Prod").
3. Enable CloudWatch X-Ray Tracing:
   - In the stage settings, click on the "Settings" tab.
   - Under the "AWS X-Ray" section, toggle the "Enable X-Ray Tracing" option to enable it.
4. Save the Configuration:
   - Click on the "Save Changes" button to save the configuration for the selected stage.
5. Repeat for Other Stages (Optional):
   - If you have multiple stages for your API, repeat steps 2 to 4 for each stage where you want to enable tracing.
6. Test and Validate Tracing:
   - Invoke your API endpoints or perform test requests to generate API traffic.
   - Monitor the AWS X-Ray console or your preferred X-Ray integration to ensure that traces are being generated and recorded.
