<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the use of AWS KMS Customer Master Keys (CMKs) for EFS encryption in API Gateway using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Key Policy to Restrict Usage:**
   Ensure that the key policy for your CMK restricts its usage to only the intended services and principals. This can be done by specifying the allowed actions and principals in the key policy.

   ```sh
   aws kms put-key-policy --key-id <your-key-id> --policy-name default --policy file://key-policy.json
   ```

   Example `key-policy.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Id": "key-default-1",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "Allow administration of the key",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin"
         },
         "Action": [
           "kms:*"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       },
       {
         "Sid": "Allow use of the key",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/EFSRole"
         },
         "Action": [
           "kms:Encrypt",
           "kms:Decrypt",
           "kms:ReEncrypt*",
           "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
           "kms:DescribeKey"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Disable Key Rotation:**
   Disable automatic key rotation for the CMK to ensure that the key is not automatically rotated, which might affect its usage.

   ```sh
   aws kms disable-key-rotation --key-id <your-key-id>
   ```

3. **Tagging the Key for Identification:**
   Tag the CMK to identify it easily and ensure it is not used for unintended purposes.

   ```sh
   aws kms tag-resource --key-id <your-key-id> --tags TagKey=Purpose,TagValue=EFS-Only
   ```

4. **Audit Key Usage:**
   Regularly audit the usage of the CMK to ensure it is only being used for the intended purpose. You can use AWS CloudTrail to monitor the usage of the key.

   ```sh
   aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=ResourceName,AttributeValue=<your-key-id>
   ```

By following these steps, you can prevent the misuse of AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS encryption in API Gateway using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent AWS KMS Customer Master Keys (CMKs) for EFS (Elastic File System) encryption in API Gateway using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Boto3
Ensure you have the Boto3 library installed, which is the AWS SDK for Python.

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### Step 2: Create a Boto3 Session
Create a Boto3 session to interact with AWS services.

```python
import boto3

# Create a session using your AWS credentials
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_AWS_REGION'
)
```

### Step 3: Define the KMS Key Policy
Define a key policy that restricts the use of the CMK to specific AWS services and principals. This policy will ensure that only authorized entities can use the CMK for EFS encryption.

```python
key_policy = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "key-default-1",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Allow administration of the key",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:root"
            },
            "Action": "kms:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Allow use of the key",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:role/YOUR_ROLE",
                    "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:user/YOUR_USER"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "kms:Encrypt",
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:ReEncrypt*",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
                "kms:DescribeKey"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Step 4: Create the KMS Key with the Defined Policy
Use the Boto3 KMS client to create a new CMK with the defined key policy.

```python
# Create a KMS client
kms_client = session.client('kms')

# Create a new CMK with the defined key policy
response = kms_client.create_key(
    Policy=json.dumps(key_policy),
    Description='CMK for EFS encryption',
    KeyUsage='ENCRYPT_DECRYPT',
    Origin='AWS_KMS'
)

# Get the Key ID of the newly created CMK
key_id = response['KeyMetadata']['KeyId']

print(f"Created CMK with Key ID: {key_id}")
```

### Summary
1. **Install Boto3**: Ensure the Boto3 library is installed.
2. **Create a Boto3 Session**: Set up a session with your AWS credentials.
3. **Define the KMS Key Policy**: Create a policy that restricts the use of the CMK.
4. **Create the KMS Key**: Use the Boto3 KMS client to create the CMK with the defined policy.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your AWS KMS Customer Master Keys are properly configured for EFS encryption, preventing unauthorized use in API Gateway.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the API Gateway console. You can do this by typing "API Gateway" in the search bar and selecting it from the dropdown menu.
3. In the API Gateway console, select the API you want to check.
4. In the API details page, select the "Stages" option from the left-hand side menu. Here, you can see all the stages of your API. Click on the stage you want to check.
5. In the stage editor, select the "Logs/Tracing" tab. Here, you can see the "CloudWatch Settings". If the "Enable CloudWatch Logs" option is not selected, it means that AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption is not enabled in API Gateway.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resources.

2. Once AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can use the following command to list all the API Gateways:

   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-apis
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the API Gateways along with their details.

3. Now, to check the AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption, you need to list all the resources of each API Gateway. You can do this by using the following command:

   ```
   aws apigateway get-resources --rest-api-id <rest-api-id>
   ```

   Replace `<rest-api-id>` with the ID of the API Gateway you want to check. This command will return a list of all the resources of the specified API Gateway.

4. Finally, for each resource, you need to check the `aws:kms:KeyArn` property. If this property is not set or is set to a key that is not a Customer Master Key, then the EFS Encryption is misconfigured. You can do this by using the following command:

   ```
   aws apigateway get-integration --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> --resource-id <resource-id> --http-method <http-method>
   ```

   Replace `<rest-api-id>`, `<resource-id>`, and `<http-method>` with the ID of the API Gateway, the ID of the resource, and the HTTP method of the integration, respectively. This command will return the details of the integration, including the `aws:kms:KeyArn` property.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) on your local system. This will allow you to interact with AWS services using Python.

```python
pip install boto3
aws configure
```

2. Create a Python script that uses Boto3 to list all the API Gateways in your AWS account.

```python
import boto3

def list_api_gateways():
    client = boto3.client('apigateway')
    response = client.get_rest_apis()
    return response['items']

api_gateways = list_api_gateways()
```

3. For each API Gateway, check if the EFS encryption is enabled. If the EFS encryption is not enabled, the API Gateway is misconfigured.

```python
def check_efs_encryption(api_gateways):
    client = boto3.client('kms')
    misconfigured_gateways = []
    for gateway in api_gateways:
        try:
            response = client.describe_key(KeyId=gateway['id'])
            if response['KeyMetadata']['KeyState'] != 'Enabled':
                misconfigured_gateways.append(gateway['name'])
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error checking EFS encryption for {gateway['name']}: {e}")
    return misconfigured_gateways

misconfigured_gateways = check_efs_encryption(api_gateways)
```

4. Print out the names of the misconfigured API Gateways.

```python
print("Misconfigured API Gateways:")
for gateway in misconfigured_gateways:
    print(gateway)
```

This script will list all the API Gateways in your AWS account and check if the EFS encryption is enabled for each one. If the EFS encryption is not enabled, the script will print out the name of the API Gateway.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The misconfiguration "AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption" means that the EFS file system is not using a KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) for encryption. To remediate this, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Create a KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) if you don't have one already:
```
aws kms create-key --description "EFS CMK"
```

2. Enable the key for EFS use:
```
aws kms enable-key --key-id <kms_key_id> --key-usage ENCRYPT_DECRYPT --grant-permissions "GranteePrincipal=ec2.amazonaws.com,Operations=['Encrypt','Decrypt']"
```
Note: Replace `<kms_key_id>` with the ID of the KMS CMK created in step 1.

3. Modify the EFS file system to use the KMS CMK:
```
aws efs update-file-system --file-system-id <efs_file_system_id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <kms_key_id>
```
Note: Replace `<efs_file_system_id>` with the ID of the EFS file system and `<kms_key_id>` with the ID of the KMS CMK created in step 1.

4. Verify that the EFS file system is using the KMS CMK for encryption:
```
aws efs describe-file-systems --file-system-id <efs_file_system_id> --query "FileSystems[*].KmsKeyId"
```
Note: Replace `<efs_file_system_id>` with the ID of the EFS file system.

If the output of the command in step 4 shows the KMS CMK ID, then the remediation is successful.
