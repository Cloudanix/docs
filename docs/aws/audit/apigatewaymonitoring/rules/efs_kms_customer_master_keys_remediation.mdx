Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration of KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EFS service.

2. Select the EFS file system that is currently using the default AWS-managed CMK for encryption.

3. Click on the "Modify" button in the top menu bar.

4. In the "Modify File System" page, scroll down to the "Encryption" section.

5. Select "Customer managed CMK" from the "Key Management" drop-down menu.

6. Choose the desired KMS Customer Master Key from the "Select a CMK" drop-down menu.

7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

8. Once the changes are saved, the EFS file system will start using the selected KMS Customer Master Key for encryption.

9. Repeat the above steps for all the other EFS file systems that are currently using the default AWS-managed CMK for encryption.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption in AWS using the AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The misconfiguration "AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption" means that the EFS file system is not using a KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) for encryption. To remediate this, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Create a KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) if you don't have one already:
```
aws kms create-key --description "EFS CMK"
```

2. Enable the key for EFS use:
```
aws kms enable-key --key-id <kms_key_id> --key-usage ENCRYPT_DECRYPT --grant-permissions "GranteePrincipal=ec2.amazonaws.com,Operations=['Encrypt','Decrypt']"
```
Note: Replace `<kms_key_id>` with the ID of the KMS CMK created in step 1.

3. Modify the EFS file system to use the KMS CMK:
```
aws efs update-file-system --file-system-id <efs_file_system_id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <kms_key_id>
```
Note: Replace `<efs_file_system_id>` with the ID of the EFS file system and `<kms_key_id>` with the ID of the KMS CMK created in step 1.

4. Verify that the EFS file system is using the KMS CMK for encryption:
```
aws efs describe-file-systems --file-system-id <efs_file_system_id> --query "FileSystems[*].KmsKeyId"
```
Note: Replace `<efs_file_system_id>` with the ID of the EFS file system.

If the output of the command in step 4 shows the KMS CMK ID, then the remediation is successful.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of using AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption, you can follow the below steps using Python:

Step 1: Create a new AWS KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) for EFS Encryption.

```
import boto3

kms = boto3.client('kms')

response = kms.create_key(
    Description='EFS CMK',
    KeyUsage='ENCRYPT_DECRYPT',
    Origin='AWS_KMS',
    CustomerMasterKeySpec='SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT'
)

key_id = response['KeyMetadata']['KeyId']
```

Step 2: Update the EFS file system to use the new CMK for encryption.

```
efs = boto3.client('efs')

response = efs.update_file_system(
    FileSystemId='fs-12345678',
    Encrypted=True,
    KmsKeyId=key_id
)
```

Step 3: Enable EFS encryption for all new file systems using the new CMK.

```
response = efs.put_account_preferences(
    ResourceId='123456789012',
    Encrypted=True,
    KmsKeyId=key_id
)
```

Note: Replace `fs-12345678` with the ID of the EFS file system you want to update, and `123456789012` with your AWS account ID.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of using AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption.
