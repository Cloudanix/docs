### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of using AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption in AWS console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to your AWS console and navigate to the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) dashboard.

2. In the KMS dashboard, click on "Customer managed keys" from the left-hand menu.

3. Identify the KMS Customer Master Key that is being used for EFS encryption.

4. Click on the key to open its details page.

5. Under "Key policy", click on "Edit".

6. In the key policy editor, add a statement to allow the EFS service to use the key for encryption by adding the following JSON statement:

```
{
    "Sid": "Allow EFS to use the key",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "Service": "elasticfilesystem.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": [
        "kms:Encrypt*",
        "kms:Decrypt*",
        "kms:ReEncrypt*",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
        "kms:Describe*"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
}
```

7. Click on "Review policy" and then "Save changes" to update the key policy.

8. Once the key policy is updated, navigate to the Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) dashboard.

9. Select the EFS file system that is using the KMS Customer Master Key for encryption.

10. Click on "Actions" and then "Modify".

11. Under "Encryption settings", select "AWS KMS key" and then select the updated KMS Customer Master Key that you just updated.

12. Click on "Save" to update the EFS file system with the new KMS key.

By following these steps, you will have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of using AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption in AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption" in AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Login to your AWS account using the AWS CLI.

2. Run the following command to create a KMS Customer Master Key (CMK):

   ```
   aws kms create-key --description "EFS CMK"
   ```

3. Once the CMK is created, run the following command to get the ARN of the CMK:

   ```
   aws kms describe-key --key-id <key-id> --query KeyMetadata.Arn
   ```

   Note: Replace <key-id> with the key ID of the CMK created in step 2.

4. Run the following command to create an EFS file system with the CMK ARN:

   ```
   aws efs create-file-system --creation-token <unique-token> --encrypted --kms-key-id <key-arn>
   ```

   Note: Replace <unique-token> with a unique token, and replace <key-arn> with the ARN of the CMK obtained in step 3.

5. Finally, mount the EFS file system to your EC2 instances and verify that the encryption is working as expected.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption" in AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of using AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS encryption in Python, follow these steps:

1. Create a new AWS KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) for EFS encryption. You can create a new CMK using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

2. Update the EFS encryption configuration to use the new CMK. You can update the EFS encryption configuration using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

3. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update any scripts or applications that use the old CMK to use the new CMK. You can update the scripts or applications to use the new CMK by updating the key identifier or alias in the code.

Here is an example Python code to update the EFS encryption configuration to use the new CMK:

```
import boto3

efs_client = boto3.client('efs')

# Get the file system ID
file_system_id = 'fs-12345678'

# Get the new CMK ARN
new_cmk_arn = 'arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234'

# Update the EFS encryption configuration
response = efs_client.update_file_system(
    FileSystemId=file_system_id,
    Encrypted=True,
    KmsKeyId=new_cmk_arn
)

print(response)
```

Note: Replace the `file_system_id` and `new_cmk_arn` variables with the actual values for your environment.
