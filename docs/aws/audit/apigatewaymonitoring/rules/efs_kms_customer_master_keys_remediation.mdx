### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the API Gateway console. You can do this by typing "API Gateway" in the search bar and selecting it from the dropdown menu.
3. In the API Gateway console, select the API you want to check.
4. In the API details page, select the "Stages" option from the left-hand side menu. Here, you can see all the stages of your API. Select the stage you want to check.
5. In the stage editor, select the "Logs/Tracing" tab. Here, you can see the "CloudWatch Settings". If the "Enable CloudWatch Logs" option is not selected, it means that AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption is not enabled in API Gateway.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the API Gateways using the following command:
   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-apis
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the Rest APIs in your AWS account.

3. Now, for each API Gateway, you need to check if the EFS encryption is enabled. You can do this by using the following command:
   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-api --rest-api-id {rest-api-id}
   ```
   Replace `{rest-api-id}` with the ID of the API Gateway you want to check. This command will return the details of the specified API Gateway.

4. In the output of the above command, look for the `encryptionEnabled` field under the `efsConfig` section. If the value of `encryptionEnabled` is `false`, then EFS encryption is not enabled for that API Gateway. If the `efsConfig` section or the `encryptionEnabled` field is not present in the output, then EFS encryption is not enabled for that API Gateway.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) on your local system. This will allow you to interact with AWS services including AWS KMS and EFS.

```python
pip install boto3
aws configure
```

2. Create a Python script that uses Boto3 to list all the API Gateways in your AWS account.

```python
import boto3

def list_api_gateways():
    client = boto3.client('apigateway')
    response = client.get_rest_apis()
    return response['items']

api_gateways = list_api_gateways()
```

3. For each API Gateway, check if it uses an AWS KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) for EFS encryption. You can do this by calling the `get_rest_api` method and checking the `apiKeySource` attribute.

```python
def check_kms_cmk_for_efs_encryption(api_gateway):
    client = boto3.client('apigateway')
    response = client.get_rest_api(restApiId=api_gateway['id'])
    return 'X-Api-Key' in response['apiKeySource']

for api_gateway in api_gateways:
    if not check_kms_cmk_for_efs_encryption(api_gateway):
        print(f"API Gateway {api_gateway['name']} does not use a KMS CMK for EFS encryption.")
```

4. If the `apiKeySource` attribute is not 'X-Api-Key', then the API Gateway is not using a KMS CMK for EFS encryption. This is a misconfiguration that should be corrected.

Please note that this script only checks for the use of a KMS CMK for EFS encryption in API Gateways. Other AWS services and resources may also require similar checks.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration of KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EFS service.

2. Select the EFS file system that is currently using the default AWS-managed CMK for encryption.

3. Click on the "Modify" button in the top menu bar.

4. In the "Modify File System" page, scroll down to the "Encryption" section.

5. Select "Customer managed CMK" from the "Key Management" drop-down menu.

6. Choose the desired KMS Customer Master Key from the "Select a CMK" drop-down menu.

7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

8. Once the changes are saved, the EFS file system will start using the selected KMS Customer Master Key for encryption.

9. Repeat the above steps for all the other EFS file systems that are currently using the default AWS-managed CMK for encryption.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption in AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

The misconfiguration "AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption" means that the EFS file system is not using a KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) for encryption. To remediate this, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Create a KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) if you don't have one already:
```
aws kms create-key --description "EFS CMK"
```

2. Enable the key for EFS use:
```
aws kms enable-key --key-id <kms_key_id> --key-usage ENCRYPT_DECRYPT --grant-permissions "GranteePrincipal=ec2.amazonaws.com,Operations=['Encrypt','Decrypt']"
```
Note: Replace `<kms_key_id>` with the ID of the KMS CMK created in step 1.

3. Modify the EFS file system to use the KMS CMK:
```
aws efs update-file-system --file-system-id <efs_file_system_id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <kms_key_id>
```
Note: Replace `<efs_file_system_id>` with the ID of the EFS file system and `<kms_key_id>` with the ID of the KMS CMK created in step 1.

4. Verify that the EFS file system is using the KMS CMK for encryption:
```
aws efs describe-file-systems --file-system-id <efs_file_system_id> --query "FileSystems[*].KmsKeyId"
```
Note: Replace `<efs_file_system_id>` with the ID of the EFS file system.

If the output of the command in step 4 shows the KMS CMK ID, then the remediation is successful.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of using AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption, you can follow the below steps using Python:

Step 1: Create a new AWS KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) for EFS Encryption.

```
import boto3

kms = boto3.client('kms')

response = kms.create_key(
    Description='EFS CMK',
    KeyUsage='ENCRYPT_DECRYPT',
    Origin='AWS_KMS',
    CustomerMasterKeySpec='SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT'
)

key_id = response['KeyMetadata']['KeyId']
```

Step 2: Update the EFS file system to use the new CMK for encryption.

```
efs = boto3.client('efs')

response = efs.update_file_system(
    FileSystemId='fs-12345678',
    Encrypted=True,
    KmsKeyId=key_id
)
```

Step 3: Enable EFS encryption for all new file systems using the new CMK.

```
response = efs.put_account_preferences(
    ResourceId='123456789012',
    Encrypted=True,
    KmsKeyId=key_id
)
```

Note: Replace `fs-12345678` with the ID of the EFS file system you want to update, and `123456789012` with your AWS account ID.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of using AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption.
