<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to enable active tracing for API Gateway stages:

```
aws apigateway update-stage --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> --stage-name <stage-name> --patch-operations '[{"op":"replace","path":"/tracingEnabled","value":"True"}]'
```

Note: Replace `<rest-api-id>` with the ID of your API Gateway REST API and `<stage-name>` with the name of the stage you want to enable active tracing for.

3. Verify that active tracing has been enabled for the specified stage by running the following command:

```
aws apigateway get-stage --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> --stage-name <stage-name> | grep tracingEnabled
```

Note: Replace `<rest-api-id>` with the ID of your API Gateway REST API and `<stage-name>` with the name of the stage you enabled active tracing for.

4. If the output of the previous command shows `"tracingEnabled": true`, then active tracing has been successfully enabled for the specified stage. If it shows `"tracingEnabled": false`, then repeat steps 2 and 3 to ensure that active tracing is properly enabled.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Active Tracing Should Be Enabled For API Gateway Stages" for AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using the following command:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Create a Boto3 client for the Amazon API Gateway service:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('apigateway')
```

3. List all the API Gateway stages for the specified API using the following command:

```python
stages = client.get_stages(restApiId='REST_API_ID')
```

Note: Replace 'REST_API_ID' with the ID of your API Gateway.

4. For each stage, check if active tracing is enabled using the following command:

```python
for stage in stages['item']:
    tracing_enabled = client.get_stage(restApiId='REST_API_ID', stageName=stage['stageName'])['tracingEnabled']
```

5. If active tracing is not enabled, enable it using the following command:

```python
if not tracing_enabled:
    client.update_stage(restApiId='REST_API_ID', stageName=stage['stageName'], patchOperations=[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/tracingEnabled', 'value': 'True'}])
```

6. Run the Python script to remediate the misconfiguration.

Note: Make sure to replace 'REST_API_ID' with the ID of your API Gateway.
