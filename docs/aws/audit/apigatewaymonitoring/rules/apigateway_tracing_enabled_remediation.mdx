### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the API Gateway console. You can do this by typing "API Gateway" into the search bar and selecting it from the dropdown menu.
3. In the API Gateway console, select the API you want to check.
4. Click on "Stages" in the left-hand navigation panel. Here, you can see all the stages for your selected API. Click on the stage you want to check. In the "Logs/Tracing" tab, you can see whether active tracing is enabled or not. If the "Enable X-Ray Tracing" box is checked, active tracing is enabled. If it's not checked, active tracing is not enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation: `pip install awscli`
   
   Configuration: `aws configure`

2. List all the APIs: Use the `get-rest-apis` command to list all the APIs in your AWS account. This command will return a list of all the APIs along with their details.

   Command: `aws apigateway get-rest-apis --region your-region-name`

3. List all the stages for each API: For each API returned by the previous command, use the `get-stages` command to list all the stages. This command will return a list of all the stages along with their details.

   Command: `aws apigateway get-stages --rest-api-id your-rest-api-id --region your-region-name`

4. Check if active tracing is enabled: For each stage returned by the previous command, check the `tracingEnabled` field. If this field is set to `false` or is not present, then active tracing is not enabled for that stage.

   Note: The `tracingEnabled` field is only present in the output if active tracing is enabled. If it's not present, then active tracing is not enabled.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, make sure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed, which allows you to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc.

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Establish a session: You need to establish a session using your AWS credentials.

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    aws_session_token='SESSION_TOKEN',
)
```

3. Connect to the API Gateway service: Once the session is established, you can connect to the API Gateway service.

```python
client = session.client('apigateway')
```

4. Check for Active Tracing: Now, you can use the `get_stage` method to retrieve the stage details and check if active tracing is enabled. If the `tracingEnabled` attribute is `False`, then active tracing is not enabled.

```python
def check_active_tracing():
    response = client.get_rest_apis()
    for item in response['items']:
        stages = client.get_stages(restApiId=item['id'])
        for stage in stages['item']:
            if not stage.get('tracingEnabled', False):
                print(f"Active Tracing is not enabled for API Gateway Stage: {stage['stageName']} in API: {item['name']}")

check_active_tracing()
```

This script will print out the names of the API Gateway Stages where active tracing is not enabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Active Tracing Should Be Enabled For API Gateway Stages" for AWS using AWS console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the API Gateway service.

2. Select the API Gateway that contains the stage for which you want to enable active tracing.

3. Click on the Stages tab and select the stage for which you want to enable active tracing.

4. Click on the Settings tab and scroll down to the "Tracing" section.

5. Click on the "Edit" button next to the "Tracing" section.

6. Select the "Enable Active tracing" checkbox.

7. Choose the appropriate tracing level - "ERROR", "INFO", or "DEBUG" based on your requirements.

8. Click on the "Save Changes" button to enable active tracing for the selected stage.

9. Repeat this process for all the stages in your API Gateway.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Active Tracing Should Be Enabled For API Gateway Stages" for AWS using AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to enable active tracing for API Gateway stages:

```
aws apigateway update-stage --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> --stage-name <stage-name> --patch-operations '[{"op":"replace","path":"/tracingEnabled","value":"True"}]'
```

Note: Replace `<rest-api-id>` with the ID of your API Gateway REST API and `<stage-name>` with the name of the stage you want to enable active tracing for.

3. Verify that active tracing has been enabled for the specified stage by running the following command:

```
aws apigateway get-stage --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> --stage-name <stage-name> | grep tracingEnabled
```

Note: Replace `<rest-api-id>` with the ID of your API Gateway REST API and `<stage-name>` with the name of the stage you enabled active tracing for.

4. If the output of the previous command shows `"tracingEnabled": true`, then active tracing has been successfully enabled for the specified stage. If it shows `"tracingEnabled": false`, then repeat steps 2 and 3 to ensure that active tracing is properly enabled.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Active Tracing Should Be Enabled For API Gateway Stages" for AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using the following command:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Create a Boto3 client for the Amazon API Gateway service:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('apigateway')
```

3. List all the API Gateway stages for the specified API using the following command:

```python
stages = client.get_stages(restApiId='REST_API_ID')
```

Note: Replace 'REST_API_ID' with the ID of your API Gateway.

4. For each stage, check if active tracing is enabled using the following command:

```python
for stage in stages['item']:
    tracing_enabled = client.get_stage(restApiId='REST_API_ID', stageName=stage['stageName'])['tracingEnabled']
```

5. If active tracing is not enabled, enable it using the following command:

```python
if not tracing_enabled:
    client.update_stage(restApiId='REST_API_ID', stageName=stage['stageName'], patchOperations=[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/tracingEnabled', 'value': 'True'}])
```

6. Run the Python script to remediate the misconfiguration.

Note: Make sure to replace 'REST_API_ID' with the ID of your API Gateway.
