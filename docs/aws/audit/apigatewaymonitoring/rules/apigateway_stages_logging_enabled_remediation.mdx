<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of API Gateway Execution Logging not being enabled in AWS using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create or Update a Log Group:**
   Ensure you have a CloudWatch Log Group where the API Gateway logs will be stored. If you don't have one, create it using the following command:
   ```sh
   aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name <your-log-group-name>
   ```

2. **Enable Logging for the API Gateway Stage:**
   Use the `update-stage` command to enable logging for a specific stage of your API Gateway. Replace `<rest-api-id>`, `<stage-name>`, and `<log-group-arn>` with your actual values.
   ```sh
   aws apigateway update-stage --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> --stage-name <stage-name> --patch-operations op=replace,path=/accessLogSettings/destinationArn,value=arn:aws:logs:<region>:<account-id>:log-group:<log-group-name>
   ```

3. **Set the Log Format:**
   Define the format of the logs that will be sent to CloudWatch. This can be done using the `update-stage` command as well. Replace `<log-format>` with your desired log format.
   ```sh
   aws apigateway update-stage --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> --stage-name <stage-name> --patch-operations op=replace,path=/accessLogSettings/format,value='<log-format>'
   ```

4. **Verify the Configuration:**
   Ensure that the logging settings have been applied correctly by describing the stage configuration.
   ```sh
   aws apigateway get-stage --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> --stage-name <stage-name>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that API Gateway Execution Logging is enabled, which helps in monitoring and troubleshooting API calls effectively.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of API Gateway Execution Logging not being enabled in AWS API Gateway using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Boto3 Library**:
   Ensure you have the Boto3 library installed, which is the AWS SDK for Python. You can install it using pip if you haven't already.

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by setting environment variables.

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. **Enable Execution Logging for API Gateway**:
   Use the following Python script to enable execution logging for a specific API Gateway stage. This script assumes you have an existing API Gateway and stage.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon API Gateway
   client = boto3.client('apigateway')

   # Replace these variables with your API Gateway ID and Stage Name
   rest_api_id = 'your_rest_api_id'
   stage_name = 'your_stage_name'
   cloudwatch_log_group_arn = 'arn:aws:logs:region:account-id:log-group:your-log-group'

   # Enable execution logging
   response = client.update_stage(
       restApiId=rest_api_id,
       stageName=stage_name,
       patchOperations=[
           {
               'op': 'replace',
               'path': '/*/*/logging/loglevel',
               'value': 'INFO'
           },
           {
               'op': 'replace',
               'path': '/*/*/logging/dataTrace',
               'value': 'true'
           },
           {
               'op': 'replace',
               'path': '/*/*/metrics/enabled',
               'value': 'true'
           },
           {
               'op': 'replace',
               'path': '/*/*/logging/loggroup',
               'value': cloudwatch_log_group_arn
           }
       ]
   )

   print("Execution logging enabled:", response)
   ```

4. **Verify Execution Logging**:
   After running the script, you can verify that execution logging is enabled by checking the API Gateway stage settings in the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS CLI.

   ```bash
   aws apigateway get-stage --rest-api-id your_rest_api_id --stage-name your_stage_name
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that execution logging is enabled for your API Gateway stages, helping you to monitor and troubleshoot your API Gateway effectively.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the API Gateway console. You can find this by typing 'API Gateway' into the search bar at the top of the console.
3. In the API Gateway console, select the API you want to check.
4. In the left navigation pane, under the selected API, click on 'Stages'. Here, you will see a list of all the stages for your API.
5. Select a stage, then in the main panel, click on the 'Logs/Tracing' tab. Here, you can check if the 'Enable CloudWatch Logs' option is enabled. If it is not, then API Gateway Execution Logging is not enabled for that API stage. Repeat this process for all stages of the API to ensure logging is enabled across the entire API.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the API Gateway.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the APIs in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-apis
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the REST APIs in your account.

3. For each API, you can check the CloudWatch settings by running the following command:

   ```
   aws apigateway get-stage --rest-api-id <restApiId> --stage-name <stageName>
   ```

   Replace `<restApiId>` and `<stageName>` with the ID and name of the API and stage you want to check. This command will return the settings for the specified stage.

4. In the output of the above command, look for the `methodSettings` field. If the `loggingLevel` is set to `OFF`, then execution logging is not enabled for that API. If the `loggingLevel` is set to `ERROR` or `INFO`, then execution logging is enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. This can be done using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the client: In your Python script, you need to import Boto3 and initialize the API Gateway client.

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('apigateway')
   ```

3. Fetch the list of Rest APIs: Use the `get_rest_apis` method to fetch the list of all Rest APIs in your AWS account.

   ```python
   response = client.get_rest_apis()
   rest_apis = response['items']
   ```

4. Check if Execution Logging is enabled: For each Rest API, check if the `loggingLevel` is set to `ERROR` or `INFO`. If it's not, then Execution Logging is not enabled.

   ```python
   for api in rest_apis:
       stage = client.get_stage(
           restApiId=api['id'],
           stageName='prod'  # replace with your stage name
       )
       if 'methodSettings' in stage:
           settings = stage['methodSettings']
           if '*/*' in settings:
               logging_level = settings['*/*'].get('loggingLevel')
               if logging_level not in ['ERROR', 'INFO']:
                   print(f"Execution Logging is not enabled for API: {api['name']}")
   ```
   
Please note that this script assumes that you have configured your AWS credentials correctly in your environment. If not, you need to do so by following the AWS CLI configuration guide. Also, replace 'prod' with your actual stage name.
