<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloudwatch Metrics Must Be Enabled For All APIs" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine and run the following command to enable CloudWatch metrics for all existing APIs in your AWS account:

```
aws apigateway update-account --metrics-enabled
```

2. To ensure that CloudWatch metrics are enabled for all new APIs created in your account, run the following command:

```
aws apigateway update-rest-api --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> --patch-operations op=replace,path=/metrics/enabled,value=true
```

Note: Replace `<rest-api-id>` with the ID of your REST API.

3. To verify that CloudWatch metrics are enabled for all APIs, run the following command:

```
aws apigateway get-account
```

This command should return a JSON object with the following key-value pair:

```
"metricsEnabled": true
```

4. To verify that CloudWatch metrics are enabled for a specific API, run the following command:

```
aws apigateway get-rest-api --rest-api-id <rest-api-id>
```

This command should return a JSON object with the following key-value pair:

```
"metrics": {
    "enabled": true
}
```

Note: Replace `<rest-api-id>` with the ID of your REST API.

By following these steps, you will have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Cloudwatch Metrics Must Be Enabled For All APIs" in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloudwatch Metrics Must Be Enabled For All APIs" for AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) library.

```
import boto3
```

2. Create a Boto3 client for the Amazon API Gateway service.

```
apigateway = boto3.client('apigateway')
```

3. Get a list of all the APIs in your AWS account using the `get_rest_apis` method.

```
response = apigateway.get_rest_apis()
```

4. Loop through the list of APIs and enable CloudWatch metrics for each one using the `update_stage` method.

```
for api in response['items']:
    stages = apigateway.get_stages(restApiId=api['id'])
    for stage in stages['item']:
        apigateway.update_stage(restApiId=api['id'], stageName=stage['stageName'], patchOperations=[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/metrics/enabled', 'value': 'true'}])
```

This code snippet will enable CloudWatch metrics for all APIs and stages in your AWS account. You can run this code as a Python script or integrate it into your existing infrastructure-as-code (IaC) pipeline to ensure that CloudWatch metrics are always enabled for your APIs.
