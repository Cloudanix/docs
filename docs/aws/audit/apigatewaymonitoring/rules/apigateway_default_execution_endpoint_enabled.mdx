How to enable default execution endpoint for APIs

#### Using AWS Console

1. Access the API Gateway Console:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the API Gateway service.
2. Select the API:
   - Choose the API for which you want to enable the default execution endpoint.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Default Execution Endpoint Should Not Be Enabled" Policy.)
3. Configure the Default Stage:
   - In the left navigation pane, click on the "Stages" option.
   - Select the default stage (usually named "prod") or create a new stage if needed.
4. Configure the Stage Execution Settings:
   - Under the selected stage, click on the "Settings" tab.
5. Enable the Default Execution Endpoint:
   - In the "Settings" section, find the "Default execution endpoint" option.
   - Toggle the option to enable it.
6. Save the Configuration:
   - Click on the "Save Changes" button to save the configuration for the default execution endpoint.
7. Deploy the API Changes:
   - Click on the "Actions" button at the top of the API Gateway console.
   - Select "Deploy API" from the dropdown menu.
   - Choose the desired deployment stage (e.g., "prod") and click on the "Deploy" button.
8. Access the Default Execution Endpoint:
   - Once the deployment is complete, you can access the default execution endpoint by using the base URL of your API followed by the stage name.
   - For example, if your API base URL is `https://api.example.com` and the stage name is "prod," the default execution endpoint will be `https://api.example.com/prod`.
