### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon API Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose APIs.

3. In the APIs pane, choose the API you want to check.

4. In the API details pane, choose the Stages option.

5. In the Stages pane, select the stage you want to check. If the "Invoke URL" at the top of the Stage Editor panel ends with `"/{proxy+}"`, the Default Execution Endpoint is enabled for the selected API stage.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all the APIs: Use the following command to list all the APIs in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-apis
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the REST APIs in your account. Each API will have an ID, name, description, created date, and endpoint configuration.

3. Check the endpoint configuration: For each API, check the endpoint configuration to see if the default execution endpoint is enabled. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-api --rest-api-id {rest-api-id}
   ```
   Replace `{rest-api-id}` with the ID of the API you want to check. This command will return the details of the specified API, including its endpoint configuration.

4. Check the output: In the output of the above command, look for the `endpointConfiguration` field. If the `types` field under `endpointConfiguration` contains `EDGE`, it means the default execution endpoint is enabled for that API. If it contains `REGIONAL` or `PRIVATE`, it means the default execution endpoint is not enabled.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, make sure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed, which allows you to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc.

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Establish a session: You need to establish a session using your AWS credentials.

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    aws_session_token='SESSION_TOKEN',
)
```

3. Connect to the API Gateway service: Once the session is established, you can connect to the API Gateway service.

```python
client = session.client('apigateway')
```

4. Check for Default Execution Endpoint: Now, you can use the get_rest_apis method to retrieve all the APIs and then check if the default execution endpoint is enabled.

```python
def check_default_execution_endpoint(client):
    response = client.get_rest_apis()
    for item in response['items']:
        if 'disableExecuteApiEndpoint' in item and item['disableExecuteApiEndpoint'] == False:
            print(f"API {item['name']} has default execution endpoint enabled")
            
check_default_execution_endpoint(client)
```

This script will print the names of all APIs that have the default execution endpoint enabled. If no such APIs are found, it will not print anything.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the steps to remediate the "Default Execution Endpoint Should Not Be Enabled" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to your AWS console and navigate to the AWS Lambda service.

2. From the list of functions, select the function that has the default execution endpoint enabled.

3. Click on the "Configuration" tab for the selected function.

4. In the "General configuration" section, scroll down to the "Network" section.

5. Under the "Network" section, you will see an option called "VPC". Click on the "Edit" button next to it.

6. In the "VPC configuration" section, you will see an option called "Default execution endpoint". Ensure that this option is set to "Disabled".

7. If the "Default execution endpoint" option is enabled, click on the "Disable" button to disable it.

8. Once you have disabled the "Default execution endpoint" option, click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

9. Verify that the changes have been applied by testing the function.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the "Default Execution Endpoint Should Not Be Enabled" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Default Execution Endpoint Should Not Be Enabled" in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or on the EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to disable the default execution endpoint:

   ```
   aws sagemaker update-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <instance-name> --default-code-repository none
   ```

   Replace `<instance-name>` with the name of the notebook instance that you want to update.

3. After running the above command, verify that the default execution endpoint is disabled by running the following command:

   ```
   aws sagemaker describe-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <instance-name> --query 'DefaultCodeRepository'
   ```

   If the output of the above command is `null`, then the default execution endpoint has been successfully disabled.

4. Repeat the above steps for all the notebook instances in your AWS account to remediate the misconfiguration "Default Execution Endpoint Should Not Be Enabled" in AWS.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Default Execution Endpoint Should Not Be Enabled" misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using the following command:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Create a Boto3 client for AWS Lambda:

```
import boto3

client = boto3.client('lambda')
```

3. Use the `update_function_configuration()` method to disable the default execution endpoint:

```
response = client.update_function_configuration(
    FunctionName='your-function-name',
    CodeSigningConfigArn='arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:code-signing-config:MyCodeSigningConfig',
    Description='Sample function',
    Environment={
        'Variables': {
            'KEY1': 'VALUE1',
            'KEY2': 'VALUE2',
        }
    },
    Handler='index.handler',
    Layers=[
        'arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:layer:my-layer:1',
    ],
    MemorySize=128,
    Role='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/lambda-role',
    Runtime='python3.8',
    Timeout=123,
    TracingConfig={
        'Mode': 'Active',
    },
    VpcConfig={
        'SubnetIds': [
            'subnet-1234abcd',
            'subnet-5678efgh',
        ],
        'SecurityGroupIds': [
            'sg-1234abcd',
        ]
    },
    **{'DefaultExecutionEndpoint': False}**
)
```

4. Replace the `FunctionName` parameter with the name of your Lambda function.

5. The `DefaultExecutionEndpoint` parameter is set to `False` to disable the default execution endpoint.

6. Once you have updated the function configuration, you can verify that the default execution endpoint has been disabled by checking the function configuration using the `get_function_configuration()` method:

```
response = client.get_function_configuration(
    FunctionName='your-function-name'
)

print(response['DefaultExecutionEndpoint'])
```

This will return `False` if the default execution endpoint has been disabled.
