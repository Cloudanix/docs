### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) Certificate Expired issues in API Gateway using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

1. **Automate Certificate Renewal:**
   - Navigate to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the AWS Management Console.
   - Ensure that you are using ACM-provided certificates, which are automatically renewed by AWS. If you are using imported certificates, consider switching to ACM-provided certificates for automatic renewal.

2. **Set Up Expiration Notifications:**
   - In the ACM console, select the certificate you want to monitor.
   - Configure Amazon CloudWatch Alarms to notify you before the certificate expires. Set up an alarm to trigger a notification (via SNS) when the certificate is nearing its expiration date.

3. **Regularly Review Certificates:**
   - Periodically review the list of certificates in the ACM console to ensure none are nearing expiration.
   - Create a routine check (e.g., monthly) to manually verify the status of all certificates.

4. **Update API Gateway with New Certificates:**
   - When a certificate is renewed, ensure that the API Gateway is updated with the new certificate.
   - Navigate to the API Gateway console, select your API, and update the Custom Domain Name settings with the new certificate ARN.

By following these steps, you can proactively manage and prevent ACM Certificate Expired issues in API Gateway using the AWS Console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) certificate expiration in API Gateway using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **List Certificates and Check Expiration Dates:**
   Regularly list your ACM certificates and check their expiration dates to ensure they are renewed before they expire.

   ```sh
   aws acm list-certificates --query "CertificateSummaryList[*].{CertificateArn:CertificateArn,DomainName:DomainName,NotAfter:NotAfter}"
   ```

2. **Request a New Certificate:**
   If a certificate is nearing its expiration date, request a new certificate. Make sure to specify the domain name(s) for which you need the certificate.

   ```sh
   aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --validation-method DNS
   ```

3. **Validate the New Certificate:**
   Follow the validation process to ensure the new certificate is issued. This typically involves creating DNS records or using email validation.

   ```sh
   aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <new-certificate-arn>
   ```

4. **Update API Gateway with the New Certificate:**
   Once the new certificate is issued, update your API Gateway to use the new certificate ARN.

   ```sh
   aws apigateway update-domain-name --domain-name example.com --patch-operations op=replace,path=/certificateArn,value=<new-certificate-arn>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your ACM certificates are always up-to-date and prevent any disruptions due to expired certificates in your API Gateway.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) certificate expiration in API Gateway using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Monitor Certificate Expiration Dates:**
   Use a Python script to regularly check the expiration dates of your ACM certificates. You can use the `boto3` library to interact with AWS services.

   ```python
   import boto3
   from datetime import datetime, timezone

   def check_certificate_expiration():
       client = boto3.client('acm')
       response = client.list_certificates()
       certificates = response['CertificateSummaryList']

       for cert in certificates:
           cert_arn = cert['CertificateArn']
           cert_details = client.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
           expiration_date = cert_details['Certificate']['NotAfter']
           days_to_expire = (expiration_date - datetime.now(timezone.utc)).days

           if days_to_expire < 30:  # Notify if the certificate will expire in less than 30 days
               print(f"Certificate {cert_arn} is expiring in {days_to_expire} days.")

   check_certificate_expiration()
   ```

2. **Automate Certificate Renewal:**
   Automate the renewal process for ACM certificates. ACM automatically renews eligible certificates, but you can ensure this by scripting the renewal process.

   ```python
   def renew_certificate(cert_arn):
       client = boto3.client('acm')
       client.renew_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
       print(f"Renewal initiated for certificate {cert_arn}")

   # Example usage
   cert_arn = 'arn:aws:acm:region:account-id:certificate/certificate-id'
   renew_certificate(cert_arn)
   ```

3. **Update API Gateway with New Certificate:**
   After renewing the certificate, update the API Gateway to use the new certificate.

   ```python
   def update_api_gateway(api_id, domain_name, cert_arn):
       client = boto3.client('apigateway')
       response = client.update_domain_name(
           domainName=domain_name,
           patchOperations=[
               {
                   'op': 'replace',
                   'path': '/certificateArn',
                   'value': cert_arn
               }
           ]
       )
       print(f"API Gateway {api_id} updated with new certificate {cert_arn}")

   # Example usage
   api_id = 'your-api-id'
   domain_name = 'your-domain-name'
   cert_arn = 'arn:aws:acm:region:account-id:certificate/certificate-id'
   update_api_gateway(api_id, domain_name, cert_arn)
   ```

4. **Set Up Notifications:**
   Set up notifications to alert you when a certificate is nearing expiration. You can use AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) to send alerts.

   ```python
   import boto3

   def send_notification(message):
       client = boto3.client('sns')
       response = client.publish(
           TopicArn='arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:topic-name',
           Message=message,
           Subject='ACM Certificate Expiration Alert'
       )
       print("Notification sent")

   # Example usage
   message = "Your ACM certificate is expiring soon. Please take action to renew it."
   send_notification(message)
   ```

By implementing these steps, you can proactively prevent ACM certificate expiration in API Gateway using Python scripts.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the API Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose 'APIs'.

3. In the APIs pane, choose the API you want to check.

4. In the API details pane, choose 'Custom Domain Names'. This will display a list of custom domain names associated with the API.

5. For each custom domain name, check the 'ACM Certificate' column. If the certificate is expired, the status will be 'Expired'.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all API Gateways: Use the following command to list all the API Gateways in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-apis
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the REST APIs in your account.

3. Get the details of each API: For each API in the list, use the following command to get its details:

   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-api --rest-api-id {rest-api-id}
   ```
   Replace `{rest-api-id}` with the ID of the API you want to check. This command will return the details of the specified API, including its name, ID, and description.

4. Check the ACM Certificate: In the details of each API, look for the `clientCertificateId` field. This field contains the ID of the ACM Certificate associated with the API. Use the following command to get the details of the certificate:

   ```
   aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn {certificate-arn}
   ```
   Replace `{certificate-arn}` with the ARN of the certificate you want to check. This command will return the details of the certificate, including its status and expiration date. If the status is `EXPIRED`, then the certificate has expired.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Before you can begin using Boto3, you need to set up authentication credentials for your AWS account using either the AWS CLI or by creating a credentials file manually. The credentials should have permissions to access the ACM and API Gateway services.

3. Create a Python script to list all the API Gateways and their associated ACM certificates:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def get_api_gateways():
       client = boto3.client('apigateway')
       response = client.get_rest_apis()
       return response['items']

   def get_certificate_arn(api):
       client = boto3.client('apigateway')
       response = client.get_domain_names()
       for domain in response['items']:
           if domain['domainName'] == api['name']:
               return domain['certificateArn']
       return None

   apis = get_api_gateways()
   for api in apis:
       certificate_arn = get_certificate_arn(api)
       if certificate_arn:
           print(f"API: {api['name']}, Certificate ARN: {certificate_arn}")
   ```

4. Create a Python script to check the expiration date of the ACM certificates:

   ```python
   import boto3
   from datetime import datetime

   def get_certificate_expiration_date(certificate_arn):
       client = boto3.client('acm')
       response = client.describe_certificate(
           CertificateArn=certificate_arn
       )
       return response['Certificate']['NotAfter']

   certificate_arns = [...]  # List of certificate ARNs obtained from the previous script
   for arn in certificate_arns:
       expiration_date = get_certificate_expiration_date(arn)
       if expiration_date < datetime.now():
           print(f"Certificate with ARN {arn} has expired.")
   ```

This script will print out the ARN of all the ACM certificates associated with API Gateways that have expired.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate an expired ACM certificate in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the expired ACM certificate by running the following command:

```
aws acm list-certificates --certificate-statuses EXPIRED
```

2. Note down the ARN of the expired certificate.

3. Request a new ACM certificate by running the following command:

```
aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --validation-method DNS
```

Note: Replace "example.com" with your domain name.

4. Update the DNS record for the domain to complete the validation process. This step may vary depending on your DNS provider.

5. Once the new ACM certificate is issued and validated, update the SSL/TLS certificate for your AWS resources, such as Elastic Load Balancers or CloudFront distributions, to use the new certificate.

6. Finally, delete the expired ACM certificate by running the following command:

```
aws acm delete-certificate --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:region:account:certificate/certificate-id
```

Note: Replace "region", "account", and "certificate-id" with the appropriate values for your expired certificate ARN.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the ACM certificate expired misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary Python libraries:

```python
import boto3
import datetime
```

2. Create a boto3 client for ACM:

```python
acm_client = boto3.client('acm')
```

3. Get a list of all the certificates in your account:

```python
certificates = acm_client.list_certificates()['CertificateSummaryList']
```

4. Loop through the certificates and check if any of them have expired:

```python
for cert in certificates:
    cert_arn = cert['CertificateArn']
    cert_details = acm_client.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
    cert_expiration = cert_details['Certificate']['NotAfter']
    if cert_expiration < datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc):
        # Certificate has expired, take remediation action
```

5. To remediate the expired certificate, you can either renew the certificate or delete it and create a new one. To renew the certificate, you can use the `renew_certificate` method:

```python
acm_client.renew_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
```

6. Alternatively, to delete the expired certificate and create a new one, you can use the `delete_certificate` and `request_certificate` methods:

```python
acm_client.delete_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
new_cert = acm_client.request_certificate(
    DomainName='example.com',
    ValidationMethod='DNS',
    SubjectAlternativeNames=[
        'www.example.com',
        'api.example.com',
    ]
)
```

Note: Replace `example.com` with your own domain name and add any additional subject alternative names as needed.

7. Once you have taken the appropriate remediation action, you can log the action and move on to the next certificate in the loop.

```python
print(f'Remediated expired certificate {cert_arn}')
```
