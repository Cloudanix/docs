### More Info:

Ensure that all the expired Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates managed by AWS Certificate Manager are removed in order to adhere to Amazon Security Best Practices. Certificate Manager is the AWS service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates for use with other Amazon services such as Elastic Load Balancing and CloudFront.

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the API Gateway service.
2. In the API Gateway dashboard, select the API for which you want to check the ACM Certificate.
3. In the API settings, navigate to the "Endpoint configurations" section. Here, you will find the details of the ACM Certificate associated with the API.
4. Check the "Expiration" field of the ACM Certificate. If the date is in the past, the certificate has expired.

#### Using CLI

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can install AWS CLI using pip (Python package manager) by running the command `pip install awscli`. After installation, you can configure it by running `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. **List API Gateways**: Use the AWS CLI to list all of your API Gateways. You can do this by running the following command: `aws apigateway get-rest-apis`. This will return a list of all your APIs, including their id, name, and description.

3. **Get API Gateway Stages**: For each API, get the stages and their associated settings. You can do this by running the following command: `aws apigateway get-stages --rest-api-id <api-id>`. Replace `<api-id>` with the id of your API. This will return a list of all the stages for that API, including their name, description, and settings.

4. **Check ACM Certificate**: For each stage, check the client certificate id. If the client certificate id is null, then the ACM certificate is not being used. If the client certificate id is not null, then an ACM certificate is being used. You can then use the AWS CLI to get the details of the ACM certificate by running the following command: `aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn>`. Replace `<certificate-arn>` with the ARN of your certificate. This will return the details of the certificate, including its status and expiration date. If the status is 'EXPIRED', then the ACM certificate has expired.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. This can be done using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the AWS client: In your Python script, you need to import the Boto3 library and initialize the AWS client for API Gateway and ACM (AWS Certificate Manager).

   ```python
   import boto3
   from botocore.exceptions import BotoCoreError, ClientError

   api_gateway = boto3.client('apigateway')
   acm = boto3.client('acm')
   ```

3. Fetch the API Gateway details and the associated ACM certificate: You can use the `get_rest_apis` method to fetch the details of all the APIs. For each API, you can get the associated ACM certificate using the `get_domain_name` method.

   ```python
   try:
       apis = api_gateway.get_rest_apis()['items']
       for api in apis:
           domain_name = api_gateway.get_domain_name(domainName=api['id'])
           certificate_arn = domain_name['certificateArn']
   except (BotoCoreError, ClientError) as error:
       print(f"An error occurred: {error}")
   ```

4. Check the expiration date of the ACM certificate: You can use the `describe_certificate` method to fetch the details of the ACM certificate. Then, you can check the `NotAfter` field to see if the certificate has expired.

   ```python
   try:
       certificate = acm.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=certificate_arn)['Certificate']
       if certificate['NotAfter'] < datetime.datetime.now():
           print(f"The certificate for API {api['name']} has expired.")
   except (BotoCoreError, ClientError) as error:
       print(f"An error occurred: {error}")
   ```
   
Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions to access the API Gateway and ACM services. Also, the above script assumes that you have configured your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or by setting the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION` environment variables.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate an ACM certificate that has expired in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) service.

2. In the ACM dashboard, select the expired certificate that you want to remediate.

3. Click on the "Actions" button and then select "Renew Certificate".

4. Follow the prompts to create a new certificate. You can either request a new certificate or import an existing one.

5. Once the new certificate is issued, update your application or website to use the new certificate.

6. Verify that the new certificate is installed correctly and that your application or website is functioning properly.

7. Finally, delete the expired certificate from the ACM dashboard to avoid confusion.

By following these steps, you can easily remediate an expired ACM certificate in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate an expired ACM certificate in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the expired ACM certificate by running the following command:

```
aws acm list-certificates --certificate-statuses EXPIRED
```

2. Note down the ARN of the expired certificate.

3. Request a new ACM certificate by running the following command:

```
aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --validation-method DNS
```

Note: Replace "example.com" with your domain name.

4. Update the DNS record for the domain to complete the validation process. This step may vary depending on your DNS provider.

5. Once the new ACM certificate is issued and validated, update the SSL/TLS certificate for your AWS resources, such as Elastic Load Balancers or CloudFront distributions, to use the new certificate.

6. Finally, delete the expired ACM certificate by running the following command:

```
aws acm delete-certificate --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:region:account:certificate/certificate-id
```

Note: Replace "region", "account", and "certificate-id" with the appropriate values for your expired certificate ARN.

#### Using Python

To remediate the ACM certificate expired misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary Python libraries:

```python
import boto3
import datetime
```

2. Create a boto3 client for ACM:

```python
acm_client = boto3.client('acm')
```

3. Get a list of all the certificates in your account:

```python
certificates = acm_client.list_certificates()['CertificateSummaryList']
```

4. Loop through the certificates and check if any of them have expired:

```python
for cert in certificates:
    cert_arn = cert['CertificateArn']
    cert_details = acm_client.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
    cert_expiration = cert_details['Certificate']['NotAfter']
    if cert_expiration < datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc):
        # Certificate has expired, take remediation action
```

5. To remediate the expired certificate, you can either renew the certificate or delete it and create a new one. To renew the certificate, you can use the `renew_certificate` method:

```python
acm_client.renew_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
```

6. Alternatively, to delete the expired certificate and create a new one, you can use the `delete_certificate` and `request_certificate` methods:

```python
acm_client.delete_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
new_cert = acm_client.request_certificate(
    DomainName='example.com',
    ValidationMethod='DNS',
    SubjectAlternativeNames=[
        'www.example.com',
        'api.example.com',
    ]
)
```

Note: Replace `example.com` with your own domain name and add any additional subject alternative names as needed.

7. Once you have taken the appropriate remediation action, you can log the action and move on to the next certificate in the loop.

```python
print(f'Remediated expired certificate {cert_arn}')
```
