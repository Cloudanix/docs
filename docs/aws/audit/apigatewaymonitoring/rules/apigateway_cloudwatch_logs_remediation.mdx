<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloudwatch Logs Must Be Enabled For All APIs" for AWS, follow the steps below:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to create a CloudWatch log group:

   ```
   aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name <log-group-name>
   ```

   Replace `<log-group-name>` with a unique name for your CloudWatch log group.

3. Run the following command to create a CloudWatch log stream:

   ```
   aws logs create-log-stream --log-group-name <log-group-name> --log-stream-name <log-stream-name>
   ```

   Replace `<log-group-name>` with the name of the log group you created in step 2, and `<log-stream-name>` with a unique name for your CloudWatch log stream.

4. Run the following command to enable CloudWatch logs for all APIs:

   ```
   aws apigateway update-usage --usage-plan-id <usage-plan-id> --patch-operations op=add,path=/apiStages/-,value="{\"apiId\":\"*\",\"stage\":\"*\",\"throttle\":{},\"quota\":{}}"
   ```

   Replace `<usage-plan-id>` with the ID of the usage plan you want to update.

5. Verify that CloudWatch logs are enabled for all APIs by checking the CloudWatch log group you created in step 2. You should see log streams for all APIs in the usage plan you updated in step 4.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Cloudwatch Logs Must Be Enabled For All APIs" for AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloudwatch Logs Must Be Enabled For All APIs" for AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to import the required AWS SDKs for Python using pip. You need to install boto3, which is the AWS SDK for Python.

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Once the SDKs are installed, you need to create an AWS client using the boto3 SDK.

```
import boto3
client = boto3.client('apigateway')
```

3. After creating the client, you need to list all the APIs in your account.

```
response = client.get_rest_apis()
```

4. Once you have the APIs, you need to enable CloudWatch Logs for each of them.

```
for item in response['items']:
    rest_api_id = item['id']
    client.update_stage(restApiId=rest_api_id, stageName='prod', patchOperations=[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/logging/loglevel', 'value': 'INFO'}, {'op': 'replace', 'path': '/logging/dataTrace', 'value': 'true'}])
```

5. This code will update the logging configuration for each API and enable CloudWatch Logs.

This should remediate the misconfiguration "Cloudwatch Logs Must Be Enabled For All APIs" for AWS.
