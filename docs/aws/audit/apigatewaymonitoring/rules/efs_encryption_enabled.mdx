title: EFS Encryption Enabled

### More Info:

Ensure that your Amazon EFS file systems are encrypted in order to meet security and compliance requirements. Your data is transparently encrypted while being written and transparently decrypted while being read from your file system, therefore the encryption process does not require any additional action from you or your application. Encryption keys are managed by AWS KMS service, eliminating the need to build and maintain a secure key management infrastructure.

### Risk Level

### Remediation

How to enable EFS Encryption.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Amazon EFS service by selecting "EFS" from the services menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "EFS Encryption Enabled" Policy.)
3. In the EFS dashboard, select the EFS file system for which you want to enable encryption.
4. In the file system details page, click on the "Actions" button and select "Modify file system."
5. In the "Modify file system" dialog box, scroll down to the "Encryption" section.
6. Enable the option "Encrypt in transit" to encrypt data in transit between your EC2 instances and the EFS file system.
7. If you want to encrypt data at rest, choose the option "Encrypt at rest."
8. By default, AWS uses the AWS-managed key for encryption. If you want to use a customer-managed key (CMK), select the option "Use customer managed CMK (AWS Key Management Service)."
9. If you selected the option to use a customer-managed CMK, choose the desired CMK from the "Customer managed CMK" dropdown menu. Ensure the CMK has the appropriate permissions.
10. Click on the "Save" button to apply the encryption settings to the EFS file system.
11. AWS will start the process of enabling encryption for the EFS file system.
12. Monitor the progress of the encryption process in the EFS dashboard.
13. Once the encryption process is complete, the EFS file system will be encrypted either in transit or at rest, based on your selected settings.
