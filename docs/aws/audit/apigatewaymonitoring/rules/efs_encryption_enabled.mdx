### More Info:

Ensure that your Amazon EFS file systems are encrypted in order to meet security and compliance requirements. Your data is transparently encrypted while being written and transparently decrypted while being read from your file system, therefore the encryption process does not require any additional action from you or your application. Encryption keys are managed by AWS KMS service, eliminating the need to build and maintain a secure key management infrastructure.

### Risk Level

High

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

HIPAA, GDPR, CISAWS, CBP, NIST

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon API Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose APIs. This will display a list of all your APIs.

3. Select the API you want to check. This will open the API Gateway dashboard for the selected API.

4. In the API Gateway dashboard, navigate to the "Settings" section. Here, look for the "Encryption" settings. If the "Encrypt Data at Rest" option is enabled, then EFS encryption is enabled for the API Gateway. If not, then EFS encryption is not enabled.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all the API Gateways: Use the following command to list all the API Gateways in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-apis
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the Rest APIs in your AWS account.

3. Get the details of each API Gateway: For each API Gateway, use the following command to get its details:

   ```
   aws apigateway get-rest-api --rest-api-id {rest-api-id}
   ```
   Replace `{rest-api-id}` with the ID of the API Gateway you want to check. This command will return the details of the specified API Gateway.

4. Check the EFS Encryption: Unfortunately, AWS API Gateway does not directly support EFS encryption. Therefore, you cannot check EFS encryption enabled in API Gateway using AWS CLI. However, you can check if the EFS file systems that your API Gateway may interact with are encrypted. Use the following command to list all your EFS file systems:

   ```
   aws efs describe-file-systems
   ```
   For each file system, check the `Encrypted` field in the output. If it is `true`, then the file system is encrypted. If it is `false`, then it is not encrypted.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if EFS Encryption is enabled in API Gateway using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to directly interact with AWS services such as API Gateway. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the Boto3 library in Python:**
   Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. To use Boto3, you first need to import it.

   ```python
   import boto3
   ```

2. **Create a session using your AWS credentials:**
   You need to provide your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to Boto3 so it can interact with AWS services on your behalf. You can do this by creating a session.

   ```python
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2' # specify the region you are interested in
   )
   ```

3. **Create an API Gateway client:**
   Once you have a session, you can create a client for API Gateway. This client will provide you with methods to interact with API Gateway.

   ```python
   client = session.client('apigateway')
   ```

4. **Check if EFS Encryption is enabled:**
   Now you can use the client to retrieve information about your APIs and check if EFS Encryption is enabled. Here is a simple example:

   ```python
   response = client.get_rest_apis()

   for item in response['items']:
       if 'efsConfig' in item:
           if 'encryptionEnabled' in item['efsConfig']:
               if item['efsConfig']['encryptionEnabled']:
                   print(f"EFS Encryption is enabled for API {item['name']}")
               else:
                   print(f"EFS Encryption is not enabled for API {item['name']}")
           else:
               print(f"EFS Encryption is not enabled for API {item['name']}")
       else:
           print(f"EFS Encryption is not enabled for API {item['name']}")
   ```

   This script will print out whether EFS Encryption is enabled for each of your APIs.

Please note that this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to access API Gateway and retrieve information about your APIs. If you don't, you may need to adjust your IAM policies accordingly.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the EFS Encryption Enabled misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) service.

2. Select the EFS file system that needs to be remediated.

3. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Modify file system".

4. In the "Modify file system" window, scroll down to the "Encryption" section.

5. Disable the encryption by selecting "No" for the "Encrypt file system" option.

6. Click on the "Modify" button to save the changes.

7. Once the changes are saved, the EFS file system will be unencrypted.

Note: If you need to encrypt the EFS file system, you can follow the same steps and select "Yes" for the "Encrypt file system" option in step 5.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of EFS Encryption Enabled in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to get a list of all the EFS file systems in your AWS account:

```
aws efs describe-file-systems
```

3. Identify the EFS file system that has encryption disabled.

4. Run the following command to enable encryption for the identified EFS file system:

```
aws efs update-file-system --file-system-id <file-system-id> --encrypted
```

Replace `<file-system-id>` with the ID of the EFS file system that you want to enable encryption for.

5. Verify that encryption is enabled for the EFS file system by running the following command:

```
aws efs describe-file-systems --file-system-id <file-system-id> --query "FileSystems[*].Encrypted"
```

Replace `<file-system-id>` with the ID of the EFS file system that you enabled encryption for.

6. Repeat the above steps for all the EFS file systems in your AWS account that have encryption disabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of EFS Encryption Enabled in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the EFS Encryption Enabled misconfiguration in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS console and navigate to the EFS service.
2. Select the EFS file system that has encryption enabled.
3. Click on the “Modify” button in the top menu bar.
4. Scroll down to the “Encryption” section and select “No” in the “Encryption” dropdown menu.
5. Click on the “Save” button to disable encryption for the EFS file system.

To do this programmatically using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to modify the encryption setting for the EFS file system. Here's an example code snippet to disable encryption for an EFS file system:

```
import boto3

# Create an EFS client
efs = boto3.client('efs')

# Set the EFS file system ID
file_system_id = 'fs-12345678'

# Disable encryption for the EFS file system
response = efs.modify_file_system(
    FileSystemId=file_system_id,
    Encrypted=False
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

Make sure to replace `fs-12345678` with the actual ID of the EFS file system that you want to remediate.
