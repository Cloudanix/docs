### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the API Gateway service.
2. In the API Gateway dashboard, select the API Gateway V2 that you want to check.
3. In the API Gateway V2 details page, select the 'Routes' option from the left-hand side menu.
4. In the Routes page, select each route one by one and check the 'Authorization' column. If the 'Authorization' column is set to 'NONE' or is empty, then the API Gateway V2 does not have an Authorization Type configuration.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the API Gateway.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the APIs in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws apigatewayv2 get-apis
   ```

   This command will return a list of all APIs in your account. Note down the API Id of the API you want to check.

3. Now, you can describe the API to get its details. Run the following command:

   ```
   aws apigatewayv2 get-api --api-id <Your-API-ID>
   ```

   Replace `<Your-API-ID>` with the API Id you noted down in the previous step. This command will return the details of the API.

4. Check the `AuthorizationType` field in the output. If it is set to `NONE`, then the API does not have any authorization type configured. If it is set to `AWS_IAM` or `CUSTOM`, then the API has an authorization type configured.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You will need the boto3 library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. You can configure it in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   Then input your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

3. Create a Python script to list all API Gateway V2 and check their authorization type:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_api_auth_type():
       client = boto3.client('apigatewayv2')
       response = client.get_apis()

       for api in response['Items']:
           api_id = api['ApiId']
           api_name = api['Name']
           api_auth_type = api.get('AuthType', 'NONE')

           if api_auth_type == 'NONE':
               print(f"API Gateway V2 '{api_name}' ({api_id}) does not have an authorization type configured.")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_api_auth_type()
   ```

   This script will list all your API Gateway V2 and print out those without an authorization type configured.

4. Run the Python script: Save the script to a file, for example, check_api_auth_type.py, and then run it using Python:

   ```bash
   python check_api_auth_type.py
   ```

   The script will print out all API Gateway V2 that do not have an authorization type configured.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of API Gateway V2 not having an Authorization Type configured in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

2. **Navigate to API Gateway**: Click on the "Services" dropdown in the top left corner and select "API Gateway" under the Networking & Content Delivery section.

3. **Select the API**: In the API Gateway dashboard, select the API that you want to remediate from the list of APIs.

4. **Configure Authorization Type**:
   - Click on the "Routes" tab on the left-hand side of the console.
   - Select the route for which you want to configure the Authorization Type.
   - Click on the "Authorization" tab in the route configuration.
   - Under the "Authorization Type" dropdown, select the appropriate authorization type based on your requirements (e.g., JWT, AWS IAM, Lambda Authorizer, etc.).

5. **Save Changes**: After selecting the desired Authorization Type, click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

6. **Test the Configuration**: It is recommended to test the API with the new Authorization Type to ensure that the configuration is working as expected.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of API Gateway V2 not having an Authorization Type configured in AWS using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of API Gateway V2 not having an Authorization Type configuration in AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. List all the APIs in your AWS account to identify the API Gateway V2 that needs to be remediated:
```bash
aws apigatewayv2 get-apis
```

2. Identify the API Gateway V2 that needs to be updated based on the API ID.

3. Update the API Gateway V2 with the required Authorization Type configuration. You can set the Authorization Type to one of the following values: `NONE`, `AWS_IAM`, `CUSTOM`, or `JWT`.

For example, to set the Authorization Type to `AWS_IAM` for the identified API Gateway V2, you can use the following command:
```bash
aws apigatewayv2 update-api --api-id <API_ID> --authorization-type AWS_IAM
```

Replace `<API_ID>` with the actual API ID of the API Gateway V2 that needs to be remediated.

4. Verify the changes by describing the API to ensure that the Authorization Type configuration has been updated successfully:
```bash
aws apigatewayv2 get-api --api-id <API_ID>
```

By following these steps and updating the API Gateway V2 with the appropriate Authorization Type configuration using AWS CLI, you can remediate the misconfiguration of API Gateway V2 not having an Authorization Type set in AWS.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of API Gateway V2 not having an authorization type configured in AWS, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. Import the necessary Python libraries for interacting with AWS services:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Initialize the AWS API Gateway client:
```python
client = boto3.client('apigatewayv2')
```

3. Get a list of existing APIs in API Gateway V2:
```python
apis = client.get_apis()
```

4. Iterate through the list of APIs to find the one that needs the authorization type configuration:
```python
for api in apis['Items']:
    api_id = api['ApiId']
    api_name = api['Name']
    
    # Check if the API needs authorization type configuration
    if not api.get('AuthorizationType'):
        # Add the required authorization type configuration
        response = client.update_api(
            ApiId=api_id,
            AuthorizationType='JWT',  # You can replace 'JWT' with the desired authorization type
            # Add other required authorization configurations here
        )
        print(f"Authorization type configured for API: {api_name}")
```

5. Run the Python script to apply the authorization type configuration to the API Gateway V2 APIs that do not have it configured.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of API Gateway V2 APIs not having an authorization type configured in AWS using Python.
