</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of API Gateway V2 by ensuring it has an authorization type configuration using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create an IAM Role for API Gateway:**
   Ensure you have an IAM role with the necessary permissions for API Gateway to use for authorization.

   ```sh
   aws iam create-role --role-name APIGatewayAuthRole --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
   ```

2. **Attach Policy to IAM Role:**
   Attach a policy to the IAM role that grants the necessary permissions.

   ```sh
   aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name APIGatewayAuthRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonAPIGatewayInvokeFullAccess
   ```

3. **Create an Authorizer:**
   Create an authorizer for your API Gateway. This example uses a Lambda authorizer.

   ```sh
   aws apigatewayv2 create-authorizer --api-id <api-id> --name MyAuthorizer --authorizer-type REQUEST --identity-source "$request.header.Authorization" --authorizer-uri arn:aws:apigateway:<region>:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/<lambda-arn>/invocations --authorizer-result-ttl-in-seconds 300
   ```

4. **Update API Gateway Route to Use Authorizer:**
   Update the route to use the created authorizer.

   ```sh
   aws apigatewayv2 update-route --api-id <api-id> --route-id <route-id> --authorization-type CUSTOM --authorizer-id <authorizer-id>
   ```

Replace `<api-id>`, `<region>`, `<lambda-arn>`, and `<route-id>` with your specific API Gateway, region, Lambda function ARN, and route ID respectively. This ensures that your API Gateway V2 has an authorization type configuration, preventing unauthorized access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of API Gateway V2 lacking an authorization type configuration in AWS using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your environment. If not, you can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials:**
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by directly configuring the `~/.aws/credentials` file.

3. **Create a Python Script to Configure Authorization:**
   Use the following Python script to create or update an API Gateway V2 route with an authorization type. This example assumes you are using a JWT authorizer.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize the API Gateway V2 client
   client = boto3.client('apigatewayv2')

   # Define the API ID and the route key
   api_id = 'your_api_id'
   route_key = 'GET /yourroute'

   # Define the authorizer ID (you should have created an authorizer beforehand)
   authorizer_id = 'your_authorizer_id'

   # Update the route with the authorization type
   response = client.update_route(
       ApiId=api_id,
       RouteKey=route_key,
       AuthorizationType='JWT',
       AuthorizerId=authorizer_id
   )

   print("Route updated with authorization type:", response)
   ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script in your Python environment to apply the authorization configuration to your API Gateway V2 route.

   ```bash
   python configure_api_gateway_authorization.py
   ```

By following these steps, you ensure that your API Gateway V2 routes have the necessary authorization type configured, thereby preventing unauthorized access.

   for item in response['Items']:
       api_id = item['ApiId']
       api_name = item['Name']
       try:
           response = client.get_authorizers(
               ApiId=api_id
           )
           if 'Items' in response:
               for authorizer in response['Items']:
                   print(f"API Name: {api_name}, Authorizer Name: {authorizer['Name']}, Authorization Type: {authorizer['AuthorizationType']}")
           else:
               print(f"API Name: {api_name} does not have an authorizer configured.")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Error getting authorizer for API: {api_name}. Error: {str(e)}")
   ```
