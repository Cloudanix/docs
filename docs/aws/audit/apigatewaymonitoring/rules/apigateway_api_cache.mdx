How to enable API cache for API Gateway.

#### Using AWS Console


1. Navigate to the Amazon API Gateway Console:
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the API Gateway service.
2. Select the API you want to enable caching for:
   - Choose the API you want to work with.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Enable API Cache" Policy.)
3. Configure the cache settings:
   - In the left navigation pane, select "Stages."
   - Choose the desired stage for which you want to enable caching.
   - Click on the "Settings" tab.
4. Enable caching for the stage:
   - Under the "Caching" section, check the box that says "Enable API cache."
   - Specify the cache capacity in terms of the cache size and the TTL (Time to Live) in seconds.
   - Adjust other cache settings as needed, such as cache data encryption.
5. Save the changes:
   - Click on the "Save changes" button to apply the caching settings to the selected stage.
6. Invalidate the cache (optional):
   - If you have made changes to your API and want to clear the cache, you can perform a cache invalidation.
   - Under the "Actions" dropdown, select "Invalidate cache" and confirm the action.
7. Deploy the API changes:
   - After enabling caching and making any necessary updates, you need to deploy the API changes for them to take effect.
   - Go back to the main API Gateway console page.
   - Select your API and choose the desired deployment stage.
   - Click on the "Actions" dropdown and select "Deploy API."
