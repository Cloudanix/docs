<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent AWS ACM Certificates from being under 45 days of renewal in API Gateway using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **List All Certificates:**
   Use the AWS CLI to list all the ACM certificates in your account. This will help you identify which certificates are nearing their expiration date.

   ```sh
   aws acm list-certificates
   ```

2. **Describe Certificate Details:**
   For each certificate, get detailed information including the expiration date. This will help you determine if any certificates are within the 45-day renewal window.

   ```sh
   aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn>
   ```

3. **Monitor Certificate Expiration:**
   Set up a monitoring mechanism to regularly check the expiration dates of your certificates. You can use AWS CloudWatch Events to trigger a Lambda function that runs the above commands and checks for certificates nearing expiration.

   ```sh
   aws events put-rule --name "CheckCertificateExpiration" --schedule-expression "rate(1 day)"
   ```

4. **Automate Renewal Process:**
   If a certificate is found to be within the 45-day renewal window, automate the renewal process using AWS CLI. This can be done by creating a script that renews the certificate and updates the API Gateway with the new certificate ARN.

   ```sh
   aws acm renew-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn>
   aws apigateway update-domain-name --domain-name <domain-name> --patch-operations op=replace,path=/certificateArn,value=<new-certificate-arn>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your ACM certificates are renewed well before they fall under the 45-day renewal window, thereby preventing any potential disruptions in your API Gateway services.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent AWS ACM Certificates from being renewed under 45 days in API Gateway using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   - Ensure you have Boto3 installed and configured with the necessary permissions to interact with ACM and API Gateway.

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **List ACM Certificates:**
   - Use Boto3 to list all ACM certificates and filter out those that are associated with API Gateway.

   ```python
   import boto3

   acm_client = boto3.client('acm')
   response = acm_client.list_certificates()

   certificates = response['CertificateSummaryList']
   ```

3. **Check Certificate Expiry Dates:**
   - Iterate through the certificates and check their expiry dates. If the expiry date is within 45 days, log a warning or take appropriate action.

   ```python
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   for cert in certificates:
       cert_details = acm_client.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=cert['CertificateArn'])
       expiry_date = cert_details['Certificate']['NotAfter']
       days_to_expiry = (expiry_date - datetime.now()).days

       if days_to_expiry < 45:
           print(f"Warning: Certificate {cert['CertificateArn']} is expiring in {days_to_expiry} days.")
   ```

4. **Automate the Monitoring:**
   - Set up a scheduled Lambda function or a cron job to run this script periodically to ensure continuous monitoring and prevention of certificates being renewed under 45 days.

   ```python
   import boto3
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       acm_client = boto3.client('acm')
       response = acm_client.list_certificates()
       certificates = response['CertificateSummaryList']

       for cert in certificates:
           cert_details = acm_client.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=cert['CertificateArn'])
           expiry_date = cert_details['Certificate']['NotAfter']
           days_to_expiry = (expiry_date - datetime.now()).days

           if days_to_expiry < 45:
               print(f"Warning: Certificate {cert['CertificateArn']} is expiring in {days_to_expiry} days.")
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively monitor and prevent ACM certificates from being renewed under 45 days in API Gateway using Python scripts.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the API Gateway service.
2. In the API Gateway dashboard, select the APIs that you want to examine.
3. In the API details page, select the "Stages" option from the left-hand side menu.
4. In the Stages section, under the "SSL certificate" tab, check the expiration date of the ACM certificate. If the certificate is set to expire in less than 45 days, it indicates a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the ACM and API Gateway services.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the ACM Certificates using the following command:
   ```
   aws acm list-certificates --region your-region
   ```
   Replace 'your-region' with the region where your ACM Certificates are located. This command will return a list of Certificate ARNs.

3. For each Certificate ARN, you can describe the certificate to get its details, including the expiration date. Use the following command:
   ```
   aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn your-certificate-arn --region your-region
   ```
   Replace 'your-certificate-arn' with the ARN of the certificate you want to check, and 'your-region' with the region where the certificate is located. This command will return the certificate details in JSON format.

4. You can then parse the JSON output to get the 'NotAfter' field, which indicates the expiration date of the certificate. If this date is less than 45 days from the current date, then the certificate is due for renewal. You can use a Python script or a tool like 'jq' to parse the JSON output. For example, using 'jq':
   ```
   aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn your-certificate-arn --region your-region | jq '.Certificate.NotAfter'
   ```
   This command will return the expiration date of the certificate. You can then compare this date with the current date to check if it's less than 45 days away.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install Boto3 in your local environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing Boto3, you need to configure it. You can configure it using AWS CLI:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   It will ask for the AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format. You can get these details from your AWS account.

2. Use Boto3 to list all the ACM Certificates:
   You can use the `list_certificates` method of ACM client in Boto3 to list all the ACM Certificates. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_certificates():
       client = boto3.client('acm')
       response = client.list_certificates()
       return response['CertificateSummaryList']

   certificates = list_certificates()
   print(certificates)
   ```
   This script will print all the ACM Certificates.

3. Check the renewal status of each certificate:
   You can use the `describe_certificate` method of ACM client in Boto3 to get the details of each certificate. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3
   import datetime

   def check_certificate_renewal(certificate_arn):
       client = boto3.client('acm')
       response = client.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=certificate_arn)
       renewal_eligibility = response['Certificate']['RenewalEligibility']
       not_after = response['Certificate']['NotAfter']
       days_to_expiry = (not_after - datetime.datetime.now()).days
       return renewal_eligibility, days_to_expiry

   for certificate in certificates:
       renewal_eligibility, days_to_expiry = check_certificate_renewal(certificate['CertificateArn'])
       print(f"Certificate: {certificate['CertificateArn']}, Renewal Eligibility: {renewal_eligibility}, Days to Expiry: {days_to_expiry}")
   ```
   This script will print the renewal eligibility and days to expiry of each certificate.

4. Filter the certificates which are eligible for renewal and have less than 45 days to expiry:
   You can modify the above script to filter the certificates which are eligible for renewal and have less than 45 days to expiry. Here is the modified script:
   ```python
   for certificate in certificates:
       renewal_eligibility, days_to_expiry = check_certificate_renewal(certificate['CertificateArn'])
       if renewal_eligibility == 'ELIGIBLE' and days_to_expiry < 45:
           print(f"Certificate: {certificate['CertificateArn']}, Renewal Eligibility: {renewal_eligibility}, Days to Expiry: {days_to_expiry}")
   ```
   This script will print only the certificates which are eligible for renewal and have less than 45 days to expiry.

That's it! By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the issue of AWS ACM certificates renewal under 45 days using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and configure your AWS credentials on your local machine.

2. Next, you need to write a Python script that will use the Boto3 library to check the expiration date of all ACM certificates in your AWS account.

3. You can use the `boto3.client('acm').list_certificates()` method to list all the certificates in your account.

4. Then, you can loop through each certificate and check if its expiration date is less than 45 days from the current date using the `datetime` module.

5. If a certificate is about to expire, you can use the `boto3.client('acm').renew_certificate()` method to renew it.

6. Finally, you can schedule the script to run periodically using a tool like AWS Lambda or cron.

Here is a sample Python code to get you started:

```
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Set the AWS region and create an ACM client
region = 'us-east-1'
acm = boto3.client('acm', region_name=region)

# Get the list of all certificates in the account
certificates = acm.list_certificates()['CertificateSummaryList']

# Loop through each certificate and check if it needs to be renewed
for cert in certificates:
    cert_arn = cert['CertificateArn']
    cert_info = acm.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)['Certificate']
    expiration_date = cert_info['NotAfter']
    days_left = (expiration_date - datetime.now()).days

    if days_left < 45:
        # Renew the certificate
        acm.renew_certificate(CertificateArn=cert_arn)
        print(f'Renewed certificate {cert_arn}')
```

Note: Make sure to test the script in a non-production environment before running it on your production AWS account.
