### More Info:

Ensure that your Amazon EFS file systems are encrypted using KMS CMK customer-managed keys instead of AWS managed-keys (default keys used by the EFS service when there are no customer keys defined) in order to have more granular control over your data-at-rest encryption/decryption process.

How to enable EFS Encryption with CMK?

#### Using AWS Console

At the moment, Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) does not support encryption with customer managed keys (CMKs) through AWS Key Management Service (KMS). EFS supports encryption at rest using its own managed keys, which are transparently managed by AWS.

When you create a new Amazon EFS file system, encryption at rest is automatically enabled. The encryption is done using the AWS-managed keys, and you don't need to take any additional steps to enable it.

If you want to ensure encryption of your EFS data at rest, you can follow these general steps:

1. Create an EFS file system: Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs to create an EFS file system. Encryption at rest will be automatically enabled.

2. Configure access settings: Set up appropriate security groups and mount targets to control access to your EFS file system.

3. Configure encryption in transit: Enable encryption in transit by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) when mounting the EFS file system on your EC2 instances.

By default, EFS automatically handles encryption at rest using its own managed keys, providing you with a secure storage solution for your data.
