To complete the verification of the domain name, add the Domain Verification Record (TXT record) and the Email Receiving Record (MX record), generated automatically by the AWS SES service, to the domain's DNS settings.

Once these records are added to your domain DNS zone file and the DNS propagation is complete, the verified identity domain status should change from pending verification to verified.

Inside Verify a New Email Address dialog box, enter your email address in the Email Address field then use the Verify This Email Address button to start the verification process.
