### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the DKIM should be verified misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to your AWS console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon SES service by searching for it in the search bar.
3. In the Amazon SES dashboard, click on the "Domains" tab on the left-hand side menu.
4. Select the domain for which you want to verify the DKIM.
5. Click on the "Generate DKIM Settings" button.
6. You will see a list of CNAME records that you need to add to your DNS settings. Copy these CNAME records.
7. Open a new tab and log in to your DNS provider's website.
8. Navigate to the DNS settings for your domain.
9. Add the CNAME records that you copied in step 6.
10. Wait for the DNS changes to propagate (this can take up to 24 hours).
11. Go back to the Amazon SES dashboard and click on the "Verify This Domain" button.
12. Amazon SES will now verify the DKIM settings for your domain.
13. Once the verification process is complete, the misconfiguration will be remediated.

Note: If you are using Route 53 as your DNS provider, you can automate the DKIM verification process by using the "Verify This Domain" button in the Amazon SES dashboard.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the DKIM verification misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine and make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the AWS account that holds the misconfigured resource.

2. Run the following command to verify the DKIM settings for all your domains in AWS SES:

```
aws ses verify-domain-dkim --domain example.com
```

Replace `example.com` with your own domain name.

3. If the DKIM verification fails, you will receive an error message. Follow the instructions in the error message to resolve the issue.

4. If the DKIM verification succeeds, you will see a success message. Repeat this process for all your domains in AWS SES.

5. Once you have verified the DKIM settings for all your domains, you should also check your DNS records to make sure that the DKIM keys are correctly published. You can use the following command to get the DKIM keys for a domain:

```
aws ses get-dkim-attributes --domain example.com
```

Replace `example.com` with your own domain name.

6. Check the output of the above command to get the DKIM keys for your domain. Make sure that these keys are correctly published in your DNS records.

7. Once you have verified the DKIM settings and DNS records, you have remediated the DKIM verification misconfiguration in AWS.

#### Using Python

To remediate the DKIM not verified misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the boto3 library to interact with AWS services using Python.
```
import boto3
```

2. Create a client for the Simple Email Service (SES) using boto3.
```
ses_client = boto3.client('ses')
```

3. Get the list of identities (email addresses or domains) that are verified in SES.
```
response = ses_client.list_identities(IdentityType='EmailAddress')
```

4. Loop through the list of identities and check if the DKIM verification status is "Success". If not, then verify DKIM for that identity using the verify_domain_dkim() method.
```
for identity in response['Identities']:
    dkim_verification = ses_client.get_identity_dkim_attributes(Identity=identity)
    if dkim_verification['DkimAttributes'][identity]['DkimVerificationStatus'] != 'Success':
        ses_client.verify_domain_dkim(Domain=identity)
```

5. This script will verify DKIM for all the email addresses or domains that are not already verified. You can schedule this script to run periodically to ensure that all your email identities have DKIM verification enabled.

Note: Make sure you have the appropriate AWS credentials configured to run this script.
