### Remediation

How to remediate if DKIM is not verified in SES configuration?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the SES service by selecting "SES" from the services menu.
3. In the SES dashboard, click on the "Domains" tab in the left navigation pane.
4. Select the domain for which DKIM verification is pending or not verified.
5. Under the "Domain details" section, locate the "DKIM status" column for the domain.
6. If the DKIM status is "Not verified" or "Pending verification," click on the "Generate DKIM settings" button next to the domain.
7. In the "Generate DKIM settings" dialog box, you will see a list of CNAME records that need to be added to your DNS configuration.
8. Take note of the CNAME records or copy them to your clipboard.
9. Open a new tab or window and access your DNS management console or contact your DNS provider.
10. Add the CNAME records to your DNS configuration. The exact steps may vary depending on your DNS provider.
11. Wait for the DNS changes to propagate, which may take some time depending on your DNS provider.
12. Return to the SES console and click on the "Refresh" button next to the domain to check the DKIM status.
13. Once the DKIM status changes to "Verified," the remediation is complete.
14. Ensure that your email sending applications or services are configured to use the verified domain and enable DKIM signing for outbound emails.
