How to enable DKIM signing for existing AWS Simple Email Service (SES) registered identities (domains and email addresses)?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using an account with appropriate permissions.
2. Open the Amazon SES console by navigating to the SES service.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "DKIM Signing Should Be Enabled For AWS SES" Policy.)
3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Email Addresses" or "Domains" depending on the type of identity you want to enable DKIM signing for.
4. Select the specific email address or domain for which you want to enable DKIM signing.
5. In the identity details page, click on the "DKIM" tab.
6. If DKIM signing is not already enabled, click on the "Enable DKIM" button.
7. Follow the instructions provided by AWS SES to complete the DKIM verification process. This typically involves adding CNAME records to your DNS configuration.
8. Once the DKIM verification is complete and the DNS records have propagated, the DKIM signing status should change to "Enabled" for the respective identity.
9. Repeat the steps for each additional email address or domain you want to enable DKIM signing for.
