### More Info:

The DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) feature should be enabled for domains and addresses in SES. DKIM is a security feature that allows recipients of an email to verify that the sender domain has authorized the message and that it has not been spoofed.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

CBP

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of DKIM signing not being enabled for AWS SES, you can follow the below steps using the AWS console:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS SES service.
3. In the left-hand menu, click on "Domains".
4. Select the domain for which you want to enable DKIM signing.
5. Click on the "Verify a New Email Address" button and follow the instructions to verify your email address.
6. Once your email address is verified, click on the "Enable DKIM" button.
7. Follow the instructions to add the DKIM records to your DNS provider.
8. Wait for the DNS changes to propagate.
9. Once the DNS changes have propagated, click on the "Verify This Domain" button to complete the DKIM signing process.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration of DKIM signing not being enabled for AWS SES.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of DKIM signing not being enabled for AWS SES, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. First, you need to verify the domain that you want to enable DKIM signing for. You can do this by running the following command:

```
aws ses verify-domain-identity --domain example.com
```

Note: Replace example.com with your own domain name.

2. After verifying the domain, you need to generate the DKIM tokens. You can do this by running the following command:

```
aws ses verify-domain-dkim --domain example.com
```

3. Next, you need to update the DNS records for your domain with the DKIM tokens that were generated in the previous step. You can find the DKIM tokens by running the following command:

```
aws ses get-identity-dkim-attributes --identities example.com
```

Note: Replace example.com with your own domain name.

4. Once the DNS records have been updated, you can enable DKIM signing for your domain by running the following command:

```
aws ses set-identity-dkim-enabled --identity example.com --dkim-enabled
```

Note: Replace example.com with your own domain name.

5. Finally, you can confirm that DKIM signing has been enabled for your domain by running the following command:

```
aws ses get-identity-dkim-attributes --identities example.com
```

Note: Replace example.com with your own domain name.

After following these steps, DKIM signing should be enabled for your AWS SES domain.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "DKIM Signing should be enabled for AWS SES" for AWS using Python, follow the below steps:

1. Import the required Python modules:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create an AWS SES client:

```python
ses_client = boto3.client('ses', region_name='us-east-1')
```

Note: Replace the region name with the region where your SES service is hosted.

3. Check if DKIM Signing is enabled for your SES domain:

```python
response = ses_client.get_identity_dkim_attributes( Identities=['example.com'] )
dkim_enabled = response['DkimAttributes']['example.com']['DkimEnabled']
```

Note: Replace the domain name "example.com" with your own domain name.

4. If DKIM Signing is not enabled, then enable it:

```python
if not dkim_enabled:
    response = ses_client.set_identity_dkim_enabled( Identity='example.com', DkimEnabled=True )
```

Note: Replace the domain name "example.com" with your own domain name.

5. Verify the DKIM Signing status:

```python
response = ses_client.get_identity_dkim_attributes( Identities=['example.com'] )
dkim_enabled = response['DkimAttributes']['example.com']['DkimEnabled']

if dkim_enabled:
    print("DKIM Signing is enabled for the SES domain.")
else:
    print("DKIM Signing is not enabled for the SES domain.")
```

Note: Replace the domain name "example.com" with your own domain name.

By following these steps, DKIM Signing can be enabled for your SES domain in AWS using Python.
