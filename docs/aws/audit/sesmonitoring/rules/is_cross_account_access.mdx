### More Info:

AWS SES identities (domains and/or email addresses) should not allow unknown cross-account access via authorization policies. Your SES identities should be configured to allow access only to trusted (friendly) AWS accounts in order to prevent unauthorized users from sending emails on your behalf.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the SES Identities Should Not Allow Cross-Account Access misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. Open the Amazon SES console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Identity Management".
3. Select the identity for which you want to remediate cross-account access.
4. Choose the "Details" tab.
5. In the "Permissions" section, locate the "Cross-Account Access" setting.
6. If the "Cross-Account Access" setting is enabled, choose the "Edit" button.
7. In the "Edit Identity Policy" dialog box, remove any statements that allow cross-account access.
8. Choose "Save Changes" to save the updated identity policy.

After following these steps, the identity will no longer allow cross-account access.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "SES Identities Should Not Allow Cross-Account Access" in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the identities in your AWS account:

```
aws ses list-identities
```

3. Identify the identities that allow cross-account access.

4. Run the following command to remove cross-account access from the identified identity:

```
aws ses delete-identity-policy --identity <identity-email-address> --policy-name "CrossAccountPolicy"
```

Note: Replace `<identity-email-address>` with the email address of the identified identity.

5. Verify that the cross-account access has been removed by running the following command:

```
aws ses get-identity-policies --identity <identity-email-address>
```

Note: Replace `<identity-email-address>` with the email address of the identified identity.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for all the identities that allow cross-account access.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "SES Identities Should Not Allow Cross-Account Access" in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the SES Identities Should Not Allow Cross-Account Access misconfiguration in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to identify the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role that has cross-account permissions to the SES identity. You can use the following code to list all the users and roles that have cross-account access to SES:

```python
import boto3

ses = boto3.client('ses')
response = ses.list_identities()
identities = response['Identities']

for identity in identities:
    response = ses.get_identity_policies(Identity=identity)
    policies = response['Policies']
    
    for policy in policies:
        if 'Statement' in policy:
            for statement in policy['Statement']:
                if 'AWS' in statement['Principal']:
                    principals = statement['Principal']['AWS']
                    
                    for principal in principals:
                        if ':' in principal:
                            account_id = principal.split(':')[0]
                            iam = boto3.client('iam')
                            response = iam.list_users()
                            users = response['Users']
                            
                            for user in users:
                                response = iam.list_attached_user_policies(UserName=user['UserName'])
                                attached_policies = response['AttachedPolicies']
                                
                                for attached_policy in attached_policies:
                                    policy_arn = attached_policy['PolicyArn']
                                    response = iam.list_policy_versions(PolicyArn=policy_arn)
                                    policy_versions = response['Versions']
                                    
                                    for policy_version in policy_versions:
                                        version_id = policy_version['VersionId']
                                        response = iam.get_policy_version(PolicyArn=policy_arn, VersionId=version_id)
                                        policy_document = response['PolicyVersion']['Document']
                                        
                                        if account_id in policy_document['Statement'][0]['Resource']:
                                            print('User {} has cross-account access to SES identity {}'.format(user['UserName'], identity))
```

2. Once you have identified the IAM user or role that has cross-account permissions to the SES identity, you can remove the permissions using the following code:

```python
import boto3

iam = boto3.client('iam')
response = iam.detach_user_policy(UserName='user_name', PolicyArn='policy_arn')
```

Replace `user_name` with the name of the IAM user and `policy_arn` with the ARN of the policy that grants cross-account access to SES.

3. Repeat step 2 for all the IAM users and roles that have cross-account access to SES.

4. Verify that the misconfiguration has been remediated by running the code in step 1 again.
