How to verify any AWS Simple Email Service (SES) identities?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using an account with appropriate permissions.
2. Open the Amazon SES console by navigating to the SES service.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "SES Identities Should Not Allow Cross-Account Access" Policy.)
3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Email Addresses" or "Domains" depending on the type of identity for which you want to disable cross-account access.
4. Select the specific email address or domain that you want to update the sending authorization policy for.
5. In the details view of the selected identity, click on the "Edit Configuration" or "Edit Policy" button.
6. Locate the section of the policy that grants cross-account access or includes the IAM roles or AWS accounts with permissions to send emails using the identity.
7. Remove or modify the policy statements that allow cross-account access. You can remove the entire statement or update the conditions to restrict access as desired.
8. After making the necessary changes, click on the "Save" or "Update" button to save the updated sending authorization policy.
