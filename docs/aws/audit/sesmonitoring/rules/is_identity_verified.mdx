### More Info:

AWS SES identities should be verified in order to prove their ownership and to prevent others from using them. Verifying identities (i.e. ownership confirmation) is an efficient way to prevent people masquerading as other email addresses when they really do not own them.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the AWS SES Identities should be verified misconfiguration:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon SES service.
2. Click on the "Identity Management" tab in the left-hand navigation menu.
3. Select the unverified identity from the list of identities.
4. Click on the "Verify a New Email Address" button.
5. Enter the email address you want to verify and click "Verify This Email Address".
6. Amazon SES will send a verification email to the address you entered.
7. Open the email and click on the verification link provided.
8. Once the email address is verified, it will be listed as a verified identity in the Amazon SES console.

Repeat the above steps for all unverified identities listed in the Amazon SES console to remediate the misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

The following are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the AWS SES Identities should be verified misconfiguration using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to list all the identities in SES:

```
aws ses list-identities
```

3. Identify the identities that are not verified and need to be remediated.

4. Run the following command to verify the identity:

```
aws ses verify-identity --identity [email_address or domain_name]
```

Replace [email_address or domain_name] with the identity that needs to be verified.

5. Repeat step 4 for all the identities that need to be verified.

6. Run the following command to confirm that the identity has been verified:

```
aws ses get-identity-verification-attributes --identities [email_address or domain_name]
```

Replace [email_address or domain_name] with the identity that has been verified.

7. Verify that the identity is now listed as verified in the output.

8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 for all the identities that have been verified.

9. Once all the identities have been verified, the misconfiguration has been remediated.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "AWS SES Identities Should Be Verified", you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to automate the process of verifying the identities. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Install boto3: Use pip to install boto3

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the boto3 SES client: Import the boto3 SES client to interact with the SES service.

```python
import boto3

ses_client = boto3.client('ses', region_name='us-west-2')
```

3. List the identities: Use the list_identities() method to get a list of all the identities (email addresses and domains) that are associated with your AWS account.

```python
response = ses_client.list_identities(
    IdentityType='EmailAddress'
)

identities = response['Identities']
```

4. Verify the identities: Use the verify_email_identity() method to verify each email address in the list of identities.

```python
for identity in identities:
    response = ses_client.verify_email_identity(
        EmailAddress=identity
    )
```

5. Verify the domains: Use the verify_domain_identity() method to verify each domain in the list of identities.

```python
response = ses_client.list_identities(
    IdentityType='Domain'
)

identities = response['Identities']

for identity in identities:
    response = ses_client.verify_domain_identity(
        Domain=identity
    )
```

6. Confirm the verification: Once you have verified the identities, you will receive an email from AWS asking you to confirm the verification. Follow the instructions in the email to complete the verification process.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "AWS SES Identities Should Be Verified" in AWS using Python and the boto3 SDK.
