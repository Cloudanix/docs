### More Info:

AWS SES identities should be verified in order to prove their ownership and to prevent others from using them. Verifying identities (i.e. ownership confirmation) is an efficient way to prevent people masquerading as other email addresses when they really do not own them.

How to verify any AWS Simple Email Service (SES) identities?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using an account with appropriate permissions.
2. Open the Amazon SES console by navigating to the SES service.
3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Email Addresses" or "Domains" depending on the type of identity you want to verify.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "AWS SES Identities Should Be Verified" Policy.)
4. Click on the "Verify a New Email Address" or "Verify a New Domain" button, depending on the type of identity you want to verify.
5. If verifying an email address, enter the email address you want to verify and click on the "Verify This Email Address" button.
6. If verifying a domain, enter the domain name you want to verify and click on the "Verify This Domain" button.
7. After clicking the verification button, Amazon SES will provide you with instructions on how to complete the verification process. The instructions may involve sending a verification email or adding specific DNS records to your domain's DNS configuration.
8. Follow the provided instructions to complete the verification process. If verifying an email address, open the verification email sent to the address and click on the verification link. If verifying a domain, add the required DNS records to your domain's DNS configuration.
9. Once you have completed the verification steps, return to the SES console and check the status of the identity you verified. It should now show as "Verified" if the verification process was successful.
