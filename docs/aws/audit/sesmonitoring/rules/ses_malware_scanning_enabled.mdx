<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of SES (Simple Email Service) Malware Scanning not being enabled using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI:**
   Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions to manage SES settings.
   ```sh
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Create or Update Receipt Rule Set:**
   Create a new receipt rule set or update an existing one to include a rule that enables malware scanning. If you don't have a receipt rule set, create one:
   ```sh
   aws ses create-receipt-rule-set --rule-set-name MyRuleSet
   ```

3. **Add Receipt Rule with Malware Scanning:**
   Add a receipt rule to the rule set that includes the `ScanEnabled` parameter set to `true`. This enables malware scanning for incoming emails.
   ```sh
   aws ses create-receipt-rule --rule-set-name MyRuleSet --rule '{
       "Name": "EnableMalwareScanning",
       "Enabled": true,
       "ScanEnabled": true,
       "Actions": [
           {
               "S3Action": {
                   "BucketName": "my-email-bucket",
                   "ObjectKeyPrefix": "emails/"
               }
           }
       ],
       "Recipients": ["example@example.com"]
   }'
   ```

4. **Set Active Receipt Rule Set:**
   Ensure that the rule set you created or updated is set as the active receipt rule set.
   ```sh
   aws ses set-active-receipt-rule-set --rule-set-name MyRuleSet
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that SES malware scanning is enabled for incoming emails using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent SES (Simple Email Service) Malware Scanning from being disabled in AWS using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here are the steps to ensure that malware scanning is enabled for SES:

1. **Install Boto3 Library**:
   Ensure you have the Boto3 library installed. If not, you can install it using pip.
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by creating a `~/.aws/credentials` file.

3. **Create a Python Script to Enable Malware Scanning**:
   Use the following Python script to enable malware scanning for SES. This script will check the current configuration and enable malware scanning if it is not already enabled.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon SES
   ses_client = boto3.client('ses', region_name='us-east-1')  # Change the region as needed

   # Function to enable email receiving
   def enable_receiving_rule_set(rule_set_name):
       try:
           response = ses_client.describe_receipt_rule_set(RuleSetName=rule_set_name)
           rules = response['Rules']
           for rule in rules:
               if 'ScanEnabled' in rule and not rule['ScanEnabled']:
                   rule['ScanEnabled'] = True
                   ses_client.update_receipt_rule(
                       RuleSetName=rule_set_name,
                       Rule=rule
                   )
                   print(f"Malware scanning enabled for rule: {rule['Name']}")
               else:
                   print(f"Malware scanning already enabled for rule: {rule['Name']}")
       except ses_client.exceptions.RuleSetDoesNotExistException:
           print(f"Rule set {rule_set_name} does not exist.")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

   # Replace 'default-rule-set' with your actual rule set name
   rule_set_name = 'default-rule-set'
   enable_receiving_rule_set(rule_set_name)
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to ensure that malware scanning is enabled for your SES receipt rules.
   ```bash
   python enable_ses_malware_scanning.py
   ```

This script will iterate through the rules in the specified rule set and enable malware scanning if it is not already enabled. Make sure to replace `'default-rule-set'` with the actual name of your rule set.

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Simple Email Service (SES) dashboard.
2. In the left navigation pane, select "Email Receiving" under "Email Receiving Settings".
3. In the "Rule Sets" section, you will see a list of all the rule sets. Click on the rule set that you want to check.
4. In the "Rules" section, look for the "Enabled" column. If the "Enabled" column for the "Malware Scanning" rule is set to "Yes", then malware scanning is enabled. If it is set to "No", then malware scanning is not enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the SES resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can use the following command to list all the receipt rules in a given receipt rule set:

   ```
   aws ses list-receipt-rules --rule-set-name <Your-Rule-Set-Name>
   ```

   Replace `<Your-Rule-Set-Name>` with the name of your rule set. This command will return a list of all the receipt rules in the specified rule set.

3. For each receipt rule, check if it has an enabled action of type `Lambda` with an invocation type of `Event`. This action is used to trigger a Lambda function for each email received. The Lambda function should be configured to scan the email for malware. You can do this by inspecting the `Actions` field of the receipt rule. Here is an example of how to do this in Python:

   ```python
   import json

   # Assume `rule` is a dictionary representing a receipt rule
   actions = rule['Actions']
   for action in actions:
       if action['Type'] == 'Lambda' and action['InvocationType'] == 'Event':
           # This is a Lambda action. Check if it is configured to scan for malware
           function_arn = action['FunctionArn']
           print(f'Lambda function {function_arn} is used to scan emails for malware')
   ```

4. If none of the receipt rules in the rule set have an enabled Lambda action configured to scan for malware, then SES malware scanning is not enabled.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if Malware Scanning is enabled in Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Set up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. **Create a SES client:**
   You can create a SES client using Boto3 as follows:

   ```python
   import boto3

   ses = boto3.client('ses')
   ```

3. **Get the SES receipt rules:**
   You can get the receipt rules using the `list_receipt_rules` method. This method returns a dictionary that contains information about the receipt rules.

   ```python
   response = ses.list_receipt_rules(RuleSetName='your_rule_set_name')
   ```

4. **Check if Malware Scanning is enabled:**
   You can check if Malware Scanning is enabled by iterating over the receipt rules and checking the `ScanEnabled` attribute.

   ```python
   for rule in response['Rules']:
       if 'ScanEnabled' in rule['Actions']:
           print(f"Malware Scanning is enabled for rule {rule['Name']}")
       else:
           print(f"Malware Scanning is not enabled for rule {rule['Name']}")
   ```

Please note that you need to replace `'your_rule_set_name'` with the name of your rule set. Also, this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to list and describe the SES receipt rules.
