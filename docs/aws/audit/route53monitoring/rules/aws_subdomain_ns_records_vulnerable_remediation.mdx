1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Route 53 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, select "Hosted zones". Here, you will see a list of all your hosted zones.
3. Click on the hosted zone for the domain you want to check. This will open a page with records set for the domain.
4. Look for the NS (Name Server) record. If the NS record is pointing to a subdomain instead of the domain itself, it means the subdomain NS records are vulnerable. This is because it allows an attacker to take over the subdomain by creating a new hosted zone with the same name.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List Hosted Zones: Once your AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the hosted zones in your AWS account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the hosted zones along with their details.

3. Get Hosted Zone Details: From the list of hosted zones, identify the hosted zone for which you want to check the NS records. You can get the details of a specific hosted zone by running the following command:

   ```
   aws route53 get-hosted-zone --id /hostedzone/Z1PA6795UKMFR9
   ```
   Replace `Z1PA6795UKMFR9` with the ID of your hosted zone. This command will return the details of the specified hosted zone including the NS records.

4. Check NS Records: From the hosted zone details, check the NS records. If the NS records are pointing to a subdomain of the domain that is hosted in the same hosted zone, then your subdomain NS records are vulnerable. This is because an attacker can take over the subdomain by creating a new hosted zone with the same name as the subdomain.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You can install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating the files ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config:

   ~/.aws/credentials:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

   ~/.aws/config:
   ```
   [default]
   region=us-east-1
   ```

3. Write a Python script to list all hosted zones and their NS records: You can use the following Python script to list all hosted zones in your AWS account and their NS records:

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('route53')

   # List all hosted zones
   response = client.list_hosted_zones()
   for zone in response['HostedZones']:
       print('Hosted zone:', zone['Name'])

       # List all NS records for this hosted zone
       response = client.list_resource_record_sets(
           HostedZoneId=zone['Id'],
           StartRecordName=zone['Name'],
           StartRecordType='NS',
       )
       for record in response['ResourceRecordSets']:
           print('NS record:', record['ResourceRecords'])
   ```

4. Analyze the output: The script will print the name of each hosted zone and its NS records. If the NS records of a hosted zone include subdomains of the zone itself, then the zone is potentially vulnerable to subdomain takeover. For example, if you have a hosted zone for example.com and its NS records include ns1.example.com, then example.com is potentially vulnerable.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the vulnerable NS records in AWS Route53 using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine if you haven't already. Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to manage Route53 resources.

2. Verify the domain ownership in the AWS Route53 console. This step is crucial to ensure that you have the necessary permissions to make changes to the DNS records.

3. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine and run the following command to list all hosted zones in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```

   Identify the hosted zone that contains the vulnerable NS records you want to remediate. Note down the `Id` of the hosted zone.

4. Run the following command to retrieve the existing NS records for the hosted zone:

   ```
   aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id <hosted-zone-id>
   ```

   Replace `<hosted-zone-id>` with the actual `Id` of the hosted zone obtained in the previous step.

5. Review the output and identify the NS records that need to be removed or updated. Note down the `Name` of each vulnerable NS record.

6. Run the following command to delete each vulnerable NS record:

   ```
   aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id <hosted-zone-id> --change-batch '{
     "Changes": [
       {
         "Action": "DELETE",
         "ResourceRecordSet": {
           "Name": "<vulnerable-ns-record-name>",
           "Type": "NS",
           "TTL": 300,
           "ResourceRecords": [
             {
               "Value": "<vulnerable-ns-record-value>"
             }
           ]
         }
       }
     ]
   }'
   ```

   Replace `<hosted-zone-id>` with the actual `Id` of the hosted zone, `<vulnerable-ns-record-name>` with the name of the vulnerable NS record, and `<vulnerable-ns-record-value>` with the value of the vulnerable NS record.

   Repeat this command for each vulnerable NS record identified in step 5.

7. After deleting the vulnerable NS records, you can optionally add or update the NS records with the correct values. Run the following command to add or update an NS record:

   ```
   aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id <hosted-zone-id> --change-batch '{
     "Changes": [
       {
         "Action": "UPSERT",
         "ResourceRecordSet": {
           "Name": "<ns-record-name>",
           "Type": "NS",
           "TTL": 300,
           "ResourceRecords": [
             {
               "Value": "<ns-record-value>"
             }
           ]
         }
       }
     ]
   }'
   ```

   Replace `<hosted-zone-id>` with the actual `Id` of the hosted zone, `<ns-record-name>` with the name of the NS record, and `<ns-record-value>` with the value of the NS record.

   Repeat this command for each NS record you want to add or update.

8. Verify the changes by running the command in step 4 again. Ensure that the vulnerable NS records are no longer present, and the correct NS records are added or updated.

By following these steps, you can remediate the vulnerable NS records in AWS Route53 using the AWS CLI.

   import boto3

   def remediate_vulnerable_ns_records():
       # Create a Route53 client
       route53_client = boto3.client('route53')

       # List all hosted zones
       response = route53_client.list_hosted_zones()

       # Iterate through each hosted zone
       for hosted_zone in response['HostedZones']:
           hosted_zone_id = hosted_zone['Id']
           hosted_zone_name = hosted_zone['Name']

           # Get the NS records for the hosted zone
           ns_records = route53_client.list_resource_record_sets(
               HostedZoneId=hosted_zone_id,
               StartRecordType='NS',
               MaxItems='1'
           )

           # Check if NS records are vulnerable
           if ns_records['ResourceRecordSets'][0]['Name'] == hosted_zone_name and len(ns_records['ResourceRecordSets']) > 1:
               vulnerable_ns_record_set = ns_records['ResourceRecordSets'][0]

               # Delete the vulnerable NS record set
               route53_client.change_resource_record_sets(
                   HostedZoneId=hosted_zone_id,
                   ChangeBatch={
                       'Changes': [
                           {
                               'Action': 'DELETE',
                               'ResourceRecordSet': vulnerable_ns_record_set
                           }
                       ]
                   }
               )

               print(f"Vulnerable NS record set deleted for hosted zone: {hosted_zone_name}")

   # Run the function to remediate the vulnerability
   remediate_vulnerable_ns_records()
   ```

4. Save the script to a file, for example, `remediate_ns_records.py`.

5. Execute the Python script:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
   - Run the command: `python remediate_ns_records.py`

   The script will connect to AWS Route53, identify the vulnerable NS records, and delete them. It will print a message for each hosted zone where the vulnerability is remediated.

Note: Make sure you have appropriate permissions to access and modify Route53 resources in your AWS account.
