### Remediation

How to ensure Route53 is being used

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the Route 53 console by navigating to the "Services" menu and selecting "Route 53" under the "Networking & Content Delivery" section.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Route 53 Should Be In Use" Policy.)
3. In the Route 53 console, click on "Hosted zones" in the left-hand navigation pane.
4. You will see a list of hosted zones. Select the hosted zone that corresponds to your domain name.
5. In the hosted zone details, look for the "NS" (Name Server) records. These records specify the authoritative name servers for your domain.
6. Take note of the name server values listed under the "Value/Route traffic to" column. These name servers should be used to configure the DNS settings for your domain with your domain registrar.
7. Visit your domain registrar's website or contact their support to update the DNS settings for your domain. Replace any existing name servers with the name servers obtained from the Route 53 hosted zone.
8. After updating the DNS settings, allow some time for the changes to propagate. DNS propagation can take up to 24 hours, although it typically occurs much faster.
9. You can use DNS lookup tools or online DNS checking services to verify that the name servers for your domain have been updated and are pointing to the Route 53 name servers.
