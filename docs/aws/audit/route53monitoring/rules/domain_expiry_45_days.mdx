### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Route 53 dashboard. You can do this by typing "Route 53" into the search bar at the top of the console, then selecting "Route 53" from the dropdown menu.
3. Once you're in the Route 53 dashboard, click on "Registered domains" in the left-hand menu. This will bring up a list of all the domains you have registered with Route 53.
4. For each domain, check the "Expiration" column. This will tell you when the domain is set to expire. If a domain is set to expire in 45 days or less, it is considered a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List hosted zones: The first step to check the domain expiry is to list all the hosted zones in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following command: `aws route53 list-hosted-zones`. This will return a list of all the hosted zones along with their details.

3. List resource record sets: Once you have the ID of the hosted zone for the domain you want to check, you can list all the resource record sets for that hosted zone. You can do this by running the following command: `aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id <HostedZoneId>`. Replace `<HostedZoneId>` with the ID of your hosted zone. This will return a list of all the resource record sets for that hosted zone.

4. Check domain expiry: Now, you can check the domain expiry by looking at the `TTL` (Time to Live) value of the `SOA` (Start of Authority) record. The `TTL` value indicates how long the domain is valid. If the `TTL` value is less than or equal to 45 days, then the domain will expire in 45 days or less.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials: Before you can interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a file at ~/.aws/credentials. At the very least, the contents of the file should be:

   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Create a Python script: This script will interact with the Route53 service, fetch all the domain names, and check if they are expiring in the next 45 days.

   ```python
   import boto3
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Create a client
   client = boto3.client('route53domains')

   # Get the list of domain names
   response = client.list_domains()

   # Get the current date
   current_date = datetime.now()

   # Check each domain
   for domain in response['Domains']:
       # Get the expiry date of the domain
       expiry_date = domain['Expiry']

       # Calculate the difference between the expiry date and the current date
       difference = expiry_date - current_date

       # If the difference is less than or equal to 45 days, print a warning
       if difference.days <= 45:
           print(f"Domain {domain['DomainName']} is expiring in {difference.days} days.")
   ```

4. Run the Python script: You can run the script using the Python interpreter. The script will print a warning for each domain that is expiring in the next 45 days.

   ```
   python check_expiry.py
   ```

Please note that this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to list and view the details of the domains in Route53. If you don't, you may need to adjust your IAM policies accordingly.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the Route 53 Domain Expiry in 45 days issue on AWS using the AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Route 53 service.
2. Click on the Registered Domains option from the left-hand menu.
3. Select the domain name that is expiring in 45 days.
4. Click on the Renew Domain button.
5. Select the number of years you want to renew the domain for and click on the Add to cart button.
6. Review the order details and click on the Complete Purchase button.
7. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the payment process.

Once the payment process is complete, the domain will be renewed for the selected number of years and the Route 53 Domain Expiry issue will be resolved. It is recommended to set up auto-renewal for the domain to avoid such issues in the future.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the Route 53 Domain Expiry In 45 Days issue for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to get a list of your Route 53 domains and their expiration dates:
```
aws route53domains list-domains
```

2. Identify the domain that is expiring within the next 45 days.

3. Renew the domain by running the following command:
```
aws route53domains renew-domain --domain-name <domain_name> --duration-in-years <number_of_years>
```
Replace `<domain_name>` with the name of the expiring domain and `<number_of_years>` with the number of years you want to renew the domain for.

4. Verify that the domain has been renewed by running the following command:
```
aws route53domains get-domain-detail --domain-name <domain_name>
```
Replace `<domain_name>` with the name of the renewed domain.

5. Check the new expiration date of the domain to ensure that it has been extended by the desired number of years.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully remediate the Route 53 Domain Expiry In 45 Days issue for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Route 53 Domain Expiry issue in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Install the required Python libraries boto3 and datetime by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install boto3 datetime
```

Step 2: Create an AWS IAM user with programmatic access and Route 53 read-only access. Generate an access key and secret access key for the user.

Step 3: In your Python script, import the required libraries and set up the AWS credentials using the access key and secret access key generated in Step 2:

```python
import boto3
import datetime

# Set up AWS credentials
aws_access_key_id = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
aws_secret_access_key = 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
client = boto3.client('route53', aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key)
```

Step 4: Use the `list_hosted_zones()` method to get a list of all the hosted zones in your AWS account:

```python
response = client.list_hosted_zones()
hosted_zones = response['HostedZones']
```

Step 5: Iterate through the hosted zones and use the `get_hosted_zone()` method to get the details of each hosted zone:

```python
for hosted_zone in hosted_zones:
    hosted_zone_id = hosted_zone['Id']
    hosted_zone_name = hosted_zone['Name']
    response = client.get_hosted_zone(Id=hosted_zone_id)
    hosted_zone_details = response['HostedZone']
```

Step 6: Check the `Expiration` field in the `hosted_zone_details` dictionary to see if the domain is expiring in the next 45 days:

```python
expiration_date = hosted_zone_details['Expiration']
expiration_date_obj = datetime.datetime.strptime(expiration_date, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')
today = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
if (expiration_date_obj - today).days <= 45:
    print(f"The domain {hosted_zone_name} is expiring in {expiration_date_obj - today} days.")
```

Step 7: If the domain is expiring in the next 45 days, you can take appropriate action such as renewing the domain or transferring it to another registrar.

Note: You can schedule this Python script to run periodically using a cron job or a similar scheduling mechanism to ensure that you are notified of any expiring domains in a timely manner.
