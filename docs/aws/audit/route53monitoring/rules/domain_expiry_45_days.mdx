<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the Route 53 Domain Expiry In 45 Days issue for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to get a list of your Route 53 domains and their expiration dates:
```
aws route53domains list-domains
```

2. Identify the domain that is expiring within the next 45 days.

3. Renew the domain by running the following command:
```
aws route53domains renew-domain --domain-name <domain_name> --duration-in-years <number_of_years>
```
Replace `<domain_name>` with the name of the expiring domain and `<number_of_years>` with the number of years you want to renew the domain for.

4. Verify that the domain has been renewed by running the following command:
```
aws route53domains get-domain-detail --domain-name <domain_name>
```
Replace `<domain_name>` with the name of the renewed domain.

5. Check the new expiration date of the domain to ensure that it has been extended by the desired number of years.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully remediate the Route 53 Domain Expiry In 45 Days issue for AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the Route 53 Domain Expiry issue in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Install the required Python libraries boto3 and datetime by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install boto3 datetime
```

Step 2: Create an AWS IAM user with programmatic access and Route 53 read-only access. Generate an access key and secret access key for the user.

Step 3: In your Python script, import the required libraries and set up the AWS credentials using the access key and secret access key generated in Step 2:

```python
import boto3
import datetime

# Set up AWS credentials
aws_access_key_id = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
aws_secret_access_key = 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
client = boto3.client('route53', aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key)
```

Step 4: Use the `list_hosted_zones()` method to get a list of all the hosted zones in your AWS account:

```python
response = client.list_hosted_zones()
hosted_zones = response['HostedZones']
```

Step 5: Iterate through the hosted zones and use the `get_hosted_zone()` method to get the details of each hosted zone:

```python
for hosted_zone in hosted_zones:
    hosted_zone_id = hosted_zone['Id']
    hosted_zone_name = hosted_zone['Name']
    response = client.get_hosted_zone(Id=hosted_zone_id)
    hosted_zone_details = response['HostedZone']
```

Step 6: Check the `Expiration` field in the `hosted_zone_details` dictionary to see if the domain is expiring in the next 45 days:

```python
expiration_date = hosted_zone_details['Expiration']
expiration_date_obj = datetime.datetime.strptime(expiration_date, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')
today = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
if (expiration_date_obj - today).days <= 45:
    print(f"The domain {hosted_zone_name} is expiring in {expiration_date_obj - today} days.")
```

Step 7: If the domain is expiring in the next 45 days, you can take appropriate action such as renewing the domain or transferring it to another registrar.

Note: You can schedule this Python script to run periodically using a cron job or a similar scheduling mechanism to ensure that you are notified of any expiring domains in a timely manner.
