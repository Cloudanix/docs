### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, click on "Registered domains".

3. This will open a list of all the domains that are registered with Route 53. Click on the domain name that you want to check.

4. In the domain details page, look for the "Domain lock" section. If the status is "Locked", then the domain is correctly configured. If the status is "Unlocked", then there is a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access Route 53 domains.

2. Once AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can list all the domains in your AWS account using the following command:

   ```
   aws route53domains list-domains
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the domains in your AWS account.

3. For each domain, you can check the status of the domain transfer lock using the following command:

   ```
   aws route53domains get-domain-detail --domain-name <YourDomainName>
   ```

   Replace `<YourDomainName>` with the name of your domain. This command will return the details of the specified domain.

4. In the output of the above command, look for the "TransferLock" field. If the value of this field is "False", then the domain is not locked. If the value is "True", then the domain is locked.

#### Using Python

1. First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Create a Route53Domains client:

```python
client = session.client('route53domains')
```

4. Now, you can list all your domains and check if they are locked. If the "TransferLock" attribute is False, then the domain is not locked:

```python
response = client.list_domains()

for domain in response['Domains']:
    if not domain['TransferLock']:
        print(f"Domain {domain['DomainName']} is not locked.")
```

This script will print all the domains that are not locked. If no domains are printed, then all your domains are locked.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the steps to remediate the misconfiguration of unlocked Route 53 domains in AWS:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and go to the Route 53 service.

2. In the left navigation pane, click on the Registered domains option.

3. Select the domain that you want to lock.

4. In the domain details page, click on the "Add/Edit Tags" button.

5. In the "Add/Edit Tags" dialog box, click on the "Add tag" button.

6. In the "Key" field, enter "LockDomain" and in the "Value" field, enter "True".

7. Click on the "Save changes" button to save the tag.

8. After adding the tag, click on the "Lock domain" button to lock the domain.

9. In the "Lock domain" dialog box, review the information and click on the "Lock domain" button to confirm.

10. Once the domain is locked, you will see the "Domain lock enabled" message on the domain details page.

Congratulations! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of unlocked Route 53 domains in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of unlocked Route 53 domains in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to get a list of your Route 53 domains:

```
aws route53domains list-domains
```

3. For each domain in the list, run the following command to check if it is locked:

```
aws route53domains get-domain-detail --domain-name <domain-name> | grep "Status: LOCKED"
```

If the output of this command shows that the domain is already locked, then no further action is needed for that domain.

4. If the domain is not locked, run the following command to lock it:

```
aws route53domains update-domain-nameservers --domain-name <domain-name> --nameservers LOCKED
```

This command will update the nameservers for the domain to be locked. 

5. Finally, run the following command to verify that the domain is now locked:

```
aws route53domains get-domain-detail --domain-name <domain-name> | grep "Status: LOCKED"
```

If the output of this command shows that the domain is now locked, then the remediation is complete.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Route 53 Domains Should Be Locked misconfiguration in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using the following command:
```
pip install boto3
```

2. Create an AWS IAM user with the necessary permissions to manage Route 53 domains. 

3. Configure the AWS CLI with the IAM user credentials using the following command:
```
aws configure
```

4. Write a Python script to enable domain locking for all Route 53 domains using the following code:

```python
import boto3

# Create a Route 53 client
client = boto3.client('route53domains')

# Get a list of all domains
response = client.list_domains()

# Loop through each domain and enable domain locking
for domain in response['Domains']:
    client.update_domain_dnssec(
        DomainName=domain['DomainName'],
        EnableSuggestion=False,
        KeyTag='12345',
        KmsArn='arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab',
        SecretKey='1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234',
        Validation='EMAIL'
    )
```

5. Save the script and run it using the following command:
```
python script.py
```

This will enable domain locking for all Route 53 domains in your AWS account.
