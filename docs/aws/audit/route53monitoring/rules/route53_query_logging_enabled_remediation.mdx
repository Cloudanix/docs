1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Hosted zones".

3. In the list of hosted zones, choose the name of the hosted zone that you want to check.

4. In the right pane, under "Hosted Zone Details", check the "Query logging" section. If it's not enabled, it will show "Not configured".

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access Route 53 services.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the following command to list all the hosted zones in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the hosted zones along with their IDs.

3. Now, for each hosted zone, you need to check if query logging is enabled. You can do this by using the following command:

   ```
   aws route53 get-query-logging-config --id <HostedZoneId>
   ```

   Replace `<HostedZoneId>` with the ID of the hosted zone you want to check. If query logging is enabled, this command will return the logging configuration. If it's not enabled, the command will return an error.

4. Repeat step 3 for each hosted zone in your AWS account. If any of the hosted zones do not have query logging enabled, you have detected a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if Route 53 Query Logging is enabled in AWS Route53 using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Setup AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to set up Boto3 on your system. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using the AWS CLI.

2. **Import Boto3 in your Python script:**
   Start your Python script by importing the Boto3 library:
   ```python
   import boto3
   ```

3. **Create a Route53 client:**
   You can create a Route53 client using the `boto3.client()` function. This client will allow you to interact with the Route53 service.
   ```python
   route53 = boto3.client('route53')
   ```

4. **Check for Query Logging:**
   You can use the `list_query_logging_configs()` function to retrieve a list of all the query logging configurations for the current AWS account. If the list is empty, it means that Route 53 Query Logging is not enabled.
   ```python
   response = route53.list_query_logging_configs()
   if not response['QueryLoggingConfigs']:
       print("Route 53 Query Logging is not enabled.")
   else:
       print("Route 53 Query Logging is enabled.")
   ```
   This script will print a message indicating whether Route 53 Query Logging is enabled or not.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of Route 53 Query Logging not being enabled in AWS, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to the AWS Management Console using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to Route 53**: Click on the 'Services' dropdown menu at the top of the console, then select 'Route 53' under the 'Networking & Content Delivery' section.

3. **Enable Query Logging**: In the Route 53 console, click on 'Query logging' in the left-hand navigation pane.

4. **Create a Query Logging Configuration**: Click on the 'Create query logging configuration' button.

5. **Configure Query Logging**: 
   - **Log group**: Select an existing CloudWatch Logs log group or create a new one where the query logs will be stored.
   - **Log group role**: Choose an IAM role that grants Route 53 permission to write logs to the selected log group.
   - **Destination**: Choose whether you want to log queries for all hosted zones or specific hosted zones.
   - **Filter**: You can optionally add a filter to log only specific queries based on criteria like domain name, query type, etc.
   - **Enable query logging**: Check the box to enable query logging.

6. **Review and Create**: Review the configuration settings to ensure they are correct, then click on the 'Create' button to enable query logging.

7. **Verify Configuration**: Once the query logging configuration is created, you can verify that query logging is enabled by checking the status in the Route 53 console.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Route 53 Query Logging not being enabled in AWS Route 53 using the AWS Management Console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To enable Route 53 query logging for AWS Route 53 using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Query Logging**: Use the following AWS CLI command to enable query logging for your Route 53 hosted zone. Replace `HOSTED_ZONE_ID` with the ID of your hosted zone.

```bash
aws route53 create-query-logging-config --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID --cloud-watch-logs-log-group /aws/route53/QUERY_LOGS
```

2. **Verify Configuration**: To verify that query logging has been enabled successfully, you can describe the query logging configuration using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws route53 list-query-logging-configs --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID
```

3. **Review Query Logs**: Once query logging is enabled, you can review the query logs in the CloudWatch Logs group `/aws/route53/QUERY_LOGS`.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of enabling Route 53 query logging for AWS Route 53 using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of Route 53 Query Logging not being enabled in AWS using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to enable query logging. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this issue:

1. Install Boto3:
   If you haven't already installed Boto3, you can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials:
   Make sure you have configured your AWS credentials either by setting environment variables or using the AWS CLI `aws configure` command.

3. Write Python script:
   Create a Python script with the following code to enable query logging for Route 53:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def enable_query_logging():
       client = boto3.client('route53')

       hosted_zones = client.list_hosted_zones()['HostedZones']
       for zone in hosted_zones:
           hosted_zone_id = zone['Id'].split('/')[-1]
           response = client.get_hosted_zone(Id=hosted_zone_id)
           if response['HostedZone']['QueryLoggingConfig']['CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn'] == '':
               client.create_query_logging_config(
                   HostedZoneId=hosted_zone_id,
                   CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn='YOUR_CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP_ARN'
               )
               print(f"Query logging enabled for hosted zone {hosted_zone_id}")

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       enable_query_logging()
   ```

   Replace `'YOUR_CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP_ARN'` with the ARN of the CloudWatch Logs log group where you want to store the query logs.

4. Run the Python script:
   Execute the Python script to enable query logging for all hosted zones in your AWS account:
   ```
   python enable_query_logging.py
   ```

5. Verify the configuration:
   After running the script, verify that query logging has been enabled for all hosted zones by checking the Route 53 console or using the Boto3 SDK to confirm the configuration.

By following these steps and running the Python script, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Route 53 Query Logging not being enabled in AWS.
