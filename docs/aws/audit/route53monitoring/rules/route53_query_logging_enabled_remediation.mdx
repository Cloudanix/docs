<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of not having Route 53 Query Logging enabled in AWS Route 53 using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create a CloudWatch Log Group:**
   First, create a CloudWatch Log Group where the Route 53 query logs will be stored.
   ```sh
   aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name /aws/route53/query-logs
   ```

2. **Get the Hosted Zone ID:**
   Identify the Hosted Zone ID for which you want to enable query logging.
   ```sh
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```

3. **Create a Query Logging Configuration:**
   Create a query logging configuration for the specified hosted zone.
   ```sh
   aws route53 create-query-logging-config --hosted-zone-id <hosted-zone-id> --cloud-watch-logs-log-group-arn arn:aws:logs:<region>:<account-id>:log-group:/aws/route53/query-logs --cloud-watch-logs-role-arn arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<role-name>
   ```

4. **Verify the Configuration:**
   Verify that the query logging configuration has been created successfully.
   ```sh
   aws route53 list-query-logging-configs
   ```

Replace `<hosted-zone-id>`, `<region>`, `<account-id>`, and `<role-name>` with your specific details. This will ensure that Route 53 query logging is enabled and logs are being sent to the specified CloudWatch Log Group.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of not having Route 53 Query Logging enabled in AWS Route 53 using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   Ensure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create a CloudWatch Log Group:**
   Before enabling query logging, you need a CloudWatch Log Group where the logs will be stored. Here is a Python script to create a CloudWatch Log Group:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def create_log_group(log_group_name):
       logs_client = boto3.client('logs')
       response = logs_client.create_log_group(
           logGroupName=log_group_name
       )
       print(f"Log Group {log_group_name} created.")
       return response

   log_group_name = '/aws/route53/query-logs'
   create_log_group(log_group_name)
   ```

3. **Enable Route 53 Query Logging:**
   Use the Boto3 Route 53 client to enable query logging for a specific hosted zone. You need the hosted zone ID and the ARN of the CloudWatch Log Group.
   ```python
   import boto3

   def enable_query_logging(hosted_zone_id, log_group_arn):
       route53_client = boto3.client('route53')
       response = route53_client.create_query_logging_config(
           HostedZoneId=hosted_zone_id,
           CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn=log_group_arn
       )
       print(f"Query logging enabled for hosted zone {hosted_zone_id}.")
       return response

   hosted_zone_id = 'Z1234567890EXAMPLE'  # Replace with your hosted zone ID
   log_group_arn = 'arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:/aws/route53/query-logs'  # Replace with your log group ARN
   enable_query_logging(hosted_zone_id, log_group_arn)
   ```

4. **Verify Query Logging Configuration:**
   Optionally, you can verify that the query logging has been enabled by listing the query logging configurations.
   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_query_logging_configs():
       route53_client = boto3.client('route53')
       response = route53_client.list_query_logging_configs()
       for config in response['QueryLoggingConfigs']:
           print(f"Hosted Zone ID: {config['HostedZoneId']}, Log Group ARN: {config['CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn']}")
       return response

   list_query_logging_configs()
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that Route 53 Query Logging is enabled for your hosted zones, thereby preventing the misconfiguration.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Hosted zones".

3. In the list of hosted zones, choose the name of the hosted zone that you want to check.

4. In the right pane, under "Hosted Zone Details", check the "Query logging" section. If it's not enabled, it will show "Not configured".
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access Route 53 services.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the following command to list all the hosted zones in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the hosted zones along with their IDs.

3. Now, for each hosted zone, you need to check if query logging is enabled. You can do this by using the following command:

   ```
   aws route53 get-query-logging-config --id <HostedZoneId>
   ```

   Replace `<HostedZoneId>` with the ID of the hosted zone you want to check. If query logging is enabled, this command will return the logging configuration. If it's not enabled, the command will return an error.

4. Repeat step 3 for each hosted zone in your AWS account. If any of the hosted zones do not have query logging enabled, you have detected a misconfiguration.

3. **Create a Route53 client:**
   You can create a Route53 client using the `boto3.client()` function. This client will allow you to interact with the Route53 service.
   ```python
   route53 = boto3.client('route53')
   ```

4. **Check for Query Logging:**
   You can use the `list_query_logging_configs()` function to retrieve a list of all the query logging configurations for the current AWS account. If the list is empty, it means that Route 53 Query Logging is not enabled.
   ```python
   response = route53.list_query_logging_configs()
   if not response['QueryLoggingConfigs']:
       print("Route 53 Query Logging is not enabled.")
   else:
       print("Route 53 Query Logging is enabled.")
   ```
   This script will print a message indicating whether Route 53 Query Logging is enabled or not.
