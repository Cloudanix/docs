How to ensure that AWS Route 53 DNS service is used within your AWS account to manage DNS zones for your domains?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: On the left Menu, under Dashboard, click Hosted Zones.

- Step 2: Click Create Hosted Zones button from the AWS dashboard top menu.

- Step 3: In the Create Hosted Zone right panel, enter the following:
  A: In the Domain Name field, enter the domain name (e.g. domain.com) that you want to manage with this DNS hosted zone.
  B: (Optional) In the Comment field, enter a description.
  C: Select Public Hosted Zone from the Type dropdown list.

- Step 4: Click Create to create the zone file for the specified domain name. Once the hosted zone is created, AWS Route 53 creates automatically a Name Server (NS) DNS record and a Start of Authority (SOA) record.

- Step 5: On the newly created hosted zone page, add the necessary DNS records from your current DNS service provider. There are two ways to add the required records:
  A: Migrate the DNS configuration by exporting the zone file from your current DNS provider and importing the file using Route 53 Import feature: - Click Import Zone File button from the top menu. - In the Zone File text box, paste the contents of the zone file exported from your current DNS provider - Click Import button to import the file. Once the DNS zone is successfully added, Route 53 will display the following message: "Your operation has been committed successfully."
  B: Migrate existing DNS records manually. Create necessary records (CNAME, MX, TXT, etc) using the AWS Route 53 dashboard menu and the record values taken from the current DNS provider: - Click Create Record Set button from the dashboard top menu. - In the Name field, enter the record name of the DNS record that you want to migrate. - From the Type dropdown list select the recordset type (e.g. A, CNAME, MX). - In the TTL (Seconds) field, enter a Time to Live value in seconds. - In the Value text box, enter the value(s) required by the selected record type (e.g. IP addresses, domain names, text strings) taken from your existing DNS zone file. - From the Routing Policy dropdown list, select the routing method for the current DNS record. - Click Create to add the new record to the hosted zone. Repeat the process to add new records.
