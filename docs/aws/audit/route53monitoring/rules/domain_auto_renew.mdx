How to fix Route53 domain auto renew not enabled?

#### Using AWS Console

To enable auto-renewal for a Route 53 domain, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Route 53 service.

2. In the left navigation pane, click on "Registered Domains" to view your registered domains.

3. Select the domain for which you want to enable auto-renewal.

4. In the domain details page, click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Enable Auto Renew".

5. Review the confirmation message and click on "Enable Auto Renew" to confirm.

Enabling auto-renewal ensures that your domain registration is automatically renewed before it expires. This helps in avoiding any disruption to your domain services. Route 53 will automatically charge the renewal fee to your AWS account based on the domain's renewal period.

Please note that the ability to enable auto-renewal may depend on factors such as domain eligibility and availability. If you encounter any issues or restrictions, you can contact AWS Support for further assistance.
