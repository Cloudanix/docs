### More Info:

Ensure that All Features is enabled within your Amazon Organizations to achieve full control over the use of AWS services and actions across multiple AWS accounts using Service Control Policies (SCPs). An SCP is a type of organization control policy that can be used to restrict what users and even administrators can do in affected AWS accounts. For example, the master account from an organization can apply SCPs that can prevent member accounts from leaving the organization. A Service Control Policy is similar to an IAM access policy except the SCP does not grant any access permissions but instead it acts like a filter that allows only the specified services and actions to be used within the organization. SCPs make use of whitelisting and blacklisting methods to filter the permissions that are available to member accounts. When whitelisting is used, you can explicitly specify the access that is allowed and all other access is implicitly blocked. When blacklisting is used, you can explicitly specify the access that is not allowed and all other access is granted
