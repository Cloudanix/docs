How to lock Route 53 Domains?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Route 53 service.
2. In the navigation panel on the left side, click on "Registered domains".
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Route 53 Domains Should Be Locked" Policy.)
3. You will see a list of your registered domains. Locate the domain you want to lock and click on its name.
4. On the domain details page, scroll down to the "Domain lock settings" section.
5. Click on the "Edit" button next to "Domain transfer lock".
6. In the "Edit domain transfer lock" window, select the option to enable the transfer lock.
7. Review the information and confirm that you want to enable the transfer lock for the domain.
8. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.
9. Once the transfer lock is enabled, the domain is protected against unauthorized transfer requests from other registrars.
10. It may take some time for the changes to propagate and for the transfer lock status to be reflected in the domain details.
11. After enabling the transfer lock, review any other domain settings, such as DNS configurations or contact information, to ensure they are up to date and accurate.
