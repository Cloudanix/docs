1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Route 53 dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu and then selecting "Route 53" under the "Networking & Content Delivery" category.
3. In the Route 53 dashboard, select "Hosted zones" from the left-hand menu.
4. Select the hosted zone you want to check. In the right-hand pane, check if AWS Config is enabled. If it's not, there will be a message indicating that AWS Config is not enabled for this hosted zone.
5. Repeat the process for all hosted zones in your AWS account to ensure AWS Config is enabled for all of them.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List hosted zones: Once AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the hosted zones in your AWS account by running the following command:
   ```
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the hosted zones along with their details.

3. Check AWS Config for each hosted zone: For each hosted zone, you need to check if AWS Config is enabled. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```
   aws configservice describe-configuration-recorder-status --configuration-recorder-name default
   ```
   Replace 'default' with the name of your configuration recorder. This command will return the status of the configuration recorder. If AWS Config is not enabled, the status will be 'STOPPED'.

4. Analyze the output: If AWS Config is enabled, the command in step 3 will return 'RECORDING'. If it is not enabled, the command will return 'STOPPED'. If you find any hosted zone with AWS Config not enabled, it means there is a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Import the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) modules and initialize the AWS Route53 and AWS Config clients:

```python
import boto3

route53_client = boto3.client('route53')
config_client = boto3.client('config')
```

2. Get the list of hosted zones in Route53:

```python
response = route53_client.list_hosted_zones()
hosted_zones = response['HostedZones']
```

3. For each hosted zone, check if AWS Config is enabled:

```python
for zone in hosted_zones:
    zone_id = zone['Id']
    try:
        response = config_client.describe_configuration_recorder_status(
            ConfigurationRecorderNames=[
                zone_id,
            ]
        )
        status = response['ConfigurationRecordersStatus'][0]['recording']
    except:
        status = False

    print(f"Hosted Zone ID: {zone_id}, AWS Config Enabled: {status}")
```

4. The script will print out whether AWS Config is enabled for each hosted zone. If AWS Config is not enabled for a hosted zone, it will print `False`.

Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions to perform these actions. Also, the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) should be installed and configured with your AWS credentials.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the AWS Config Should Be Enabled misconfiguration using the AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Config service.
3. Click on the "Get started" button to begin setting up AWS Config.
4. On the "AWS Config" page, select the region you want to enable AWS Config in.
5. Choose the resource types that you want AWS Config to monitor for changes.
6. For "Amazon S3 bucket for AWS Config snapshots", choose an S3 bucket to store configuration snapshots.
7. For "Amazon SNS topic for AWS Config notifications", select an SNS topic to receive notifications.
8. Click on the "Next" button to proceed to the "Rules" page.
9. On the "Rules" page, select the rules that you want AWS Config to evaluate.
10. Click on the "Next" button to proceed to the "Review" page.
11. Review the settings and click on the "Confirm" button to enable AWS Config.
12. Wait for AWS Config to finish setting up and start monitoring your resources.

Once AWS Config is enabled, it will continuously monitor your resources and notify you of any configuration changes or violations.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "AWS Config Should Be Enabled" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or terminal.

2. Run the following command to enable AWS Config:

```
aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule file://rule.json
```

Note: Make sure to replace `rule.json` with the name of the JSON file that contains the configuration rule. You can create a new JSON file with the following contents:

```
{
    "ConfigRuleName": "aws-config-enabled",
    "Description": "Checks whether AWS Config is enabled in the account",
    "Scope": {
        "ComplianceResourceTypes": [
            "AWS::::Account"
        ]
    },
    "Source": {
        "Owner": "AWS",
        "SourceIdentifier": "CONFIG_SERVICE_ENABLED"
    }
}
```

3. After running the command, AWS Config will be enabled in your AWS account. You can verify this by going to the AWS Config console and checking the status.

Note: It may take a few minutes for the configuration changes to take effect.

4. You can also use the following command to check the status of AWS Config:

```
aws configservice describe-configuration-recorders
```

This command will show you the status of the configuration recorders for AWS Config.

5. Once you have verified that AWS Config is enabled, you can close the AWS CLI.

Congratulations! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "AWS Config Should Be Enabled" for AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "AWS Config Should Be Enabled" for AWS using python, follow these steps:

1. Import the boto3 library to interact with AWS services using Python.

```
import boto3
```

2. Create a boto3 client for AWS Config.

```
config_client = boto3.client('config')
```

3. Check if AWS Config is enabled. If it is not enabled, enable it using the `put_config_rule` method.

```
response = config_client.describe_configuration_recorder_status()
if not response['ConfigurationRecordersStatus'][0]['recording']:
    response = config_client.put_configuration_recorder(
        ConfigurationRecorder={
            'name': 'default',
            'roleARN': 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/config-role',
            'recordingGroup': {
                'allSupported': True,
                'includeGlobalResourceTypes': True
            }
        }
    )
```

4. Set the delivery channel for AWS Config. This will specify where the AWS Config data will be delivered.

```
response = config_client.put_delivery_channel(
    DeliveryChannel={
        'name': 'default',
        's3BucketName': 'myconfigbucket',
        'configSnapshotDeliveryProperties': {
            'deliveryFrequency': 'TwentyFour_Hours'
        }
    }
)
```

5. Confirm that AWS Config is enabled.

```
response = config_client.describe_configuration_recorder_status()
if response['ConfigurationRecordersStatus'][0]['recording']:
    print('AWS Config is enabled.')
```

Note: Replace `123456789012` with your AWS account number and `myconfigbucket` with the name of your S3 bucket where you want to store the AWS Config data.
