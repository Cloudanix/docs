<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "AWS Config Should Be Enabled" for AWS using python, follow these steps:

1. Import the boto3 library to interact with AWS services using Python.

```
import boto3
```

2. Create a boto3 client for AWS Config.

```
config_client = boto3.client('config')
```

3. Check if AWS Config is enabled. If it is not enabled, enable it using the `put_config_rule` method.

```
response = config_client.describe_configuration_recorder_status()
if not response['ConfigurationRecordersStatus'][0]['recording']:
    response = config_client.put_configuration_recorder(
        ConfigurationRecorder={
            'name': 'default',
            'roleARN': 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/config-role',
            'recordingGroup': {
                'allSupported': True,
                'includeGlobalResourceTypes': True
            }
        }
    )
```

4. Set the delivery channel for AWS Config. This will specify where the AWS Config data will be delivered.

```
response = config_client.put_delivery_channel(
    DeliveryChannel={
        'name': 'default',
        's3BucketName': 'myconfigbucket',
        'configSnapshotDeliveryProperties': {
            'deliveryFrequency': 'TwentyFour_Hours'
        }
    }
)
```

5. Confirm that AWS Config is enabled.

```
response = config_client.describe_configuration_recorder_status()
if response['ConfigurationRecordersStatus'][0]['recording']:
    print('AWS Config is enabled.')
```

Note: Replace `123456789012` with your AWS account number and `myconfigbucket` with the name of your S3 bucket where you want to store the AWS Config data.
