### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of an AWS CloudFront distribution alias record having no S3 origin, you can follow the step-by-step instructions below using the AWS Management Console:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the Route 53 console.
3. In the navigation pane, choose "Hosted zones."
4. Select the hosted zone for the domain associated with the CloudFront distribution.
5. Locate the alias record that points to the CloudFront distribution.
6. Note down the CloudFront distribution domain name associated with the alias record.
7. Open the CloudFront console.
8. In the CloudFront console, select the CloudFront distribution with the noted domain name.
9. Choose the "Origins and Origin Groups" tab.
10. Click on "Create Origin" or select an existing S3 origin.
11. Configure the S3 origin by providing the S3 bucket's domain name or its website endpoint.
12. Save the changes and wait for the CloudFront distribution to deploy the changes.
13. Once the CloudFront distribution has finished deploying, go back to the Route 53 console.
14. Select the hosted zone for the domain associated with the CloudFront distribution.
15. Locate the alias record that points to the CloudFront distribution.
16. Edit the alias record and update the CloudFront distribution domain name to the correct one.
17. Save the changes.

By following these steps, you will have successfully remediated the issue of an AWS CloudFront distribution alias record having no S3 origin.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of an AWS CloudFront distribution alias record having no S3 origin, you can follow the steps below using the AWS CLI:

Step 1: Identify the CloudFront distribution ID:
Run the following command to list all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account:
```
aws cloudfront list-distributions
```
Identify the distribution ID of the misconfigured CloudFront distribution.

Step 2: Update the CloudFront distribution:
Run the following command to update the CloudFront distribution with the correct S3 origin:
```
aws cloudfront update-distribution --id <distribution-id> --origin S3DomainName=<s3-bucket-name>.s3.amazonaws.com
```
Replace `<distribution-id>` with the actual distribution ID and `<s3-bucket-name>` with the name of your S3 bucket.

Step 3: Wait for the distribution update to complete:
Run the following command to wait until the distribution update is complete:
```
aws cloudfront wait distribution-deployed --id <distribution-id>
```
Replace `<distribution-id>` with the actual distribution ID.

Step 4: Verify the distribution update:
Run the following command to verify that the CloudFront distribution has been updated successfully:
```
aws cloudfront get-distribution --id <distribution-id> --query 'Distribution.DistributionConfig.Origins.Items[].DomainName'
```
Replace `<distribution-id>` with the actual distribution ID.

This command will return the domain name of the S3 bucket, indicating that the S3 origin has been added successfully.

Step 5: Update Route53 Alias record:
Now that the CloudFront distribution has been updated with the correct S3 origin, you need to update the Route53 Alias record to point to the updated CloudFront distribution.

You can update the Route53 Alias record using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. If you prefer using the CLI, you can run the following command:
```
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id <hosted-zone-id> --change-batch '{"Changes": [{"Action": "UPSERT","ResourceRecordSet": {"Name": "<alias-record-name>","Type": "A","AliasTarget": {"DNSName": "<cloudfront-domain-name>","EvaluateTargetHealth": false},"SetIdentifier": "<identifier>","Weight": 1}}]}'
```
Replace `<hosted-zone-id>` with the ID of your Route53 hosted zone, `<alias-record-name>` with the name of your Alias record, `<cloudfront-domain-name>` with the CloudFront domain name associated with the distribution, and `<identifier>` with a unique identifier for the record set.

Step 6: Verify the Route53 Alias record update:
Run the following command to verify that the Route53 Alias record has been updated successfully:
```
aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id <hosted-zone-id> --query 'ResourceRecordSets[?Name==`<alias-record-name>`].AliasTarget.DNSName'
```
Replace `<hosted-zone-id>` with the ID of your Route53 hosted zone and `<alias-record-name>` with the name of your Alias record.

This command will return the CloudFront domain name, indicating that the Alias record has been updated successfully.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of an AWS CloudFront distribution alias record having no S3 origin using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of an AWS CloudFront distribution alias record with no S3 origin using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK libraries:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Initialize the AWS Route53 client:
```python
route53_client = boto3.client('route53')
```

3. Retrieve the hosted zone ID for the domain:
```python
response = route53_client.list_hosted_zones_by_name(DNSName='example.com')
hosted_zone_id = response['HostedZones'][0]['Id']
```
Note: Replace 'example.com' with your actual domain name.

4. Retrieve the existing record sets in the hosted zone:
```python
response = route53_client.list_resource_record_sets(HostedZoneId=hosted_zone_id)
record_sets = response['ResourceRecordSets']
```

5. Identify the CloudFront distribution alias record without an S3 origin:
```python
record_to_update = None
for record_set in record_sets:
    if record_set['Type'] == 'A' and record_set['AliasTarget']['DNSName'].startswith('d123456789.cloudfront.net'):
        if 'S3OriginConfig' not in record_set['AliasTarget']:
            record_to_update = record_set
            break
```
Note: Replace 'd123456789.cloudfront.net' with the CloudFront distribution DNS name.

6. Update the record set with the correct S3 origin:
```python
if record_to_update:
    route53_client.change_resource_record_sets(
        HostedZoneId=hosted_zone_id,
        ChangeBatch={
            'Changes': [{
                'Action': 'UPSERT',
                'ResourceRecordSet': {
                    'Name': record_to_update['Name'],
                    'Type': record_to_update['Type'],
                    'AliasTarget': {
                        'HostedZoneId': record_to_update['AliasTarget']['HostedZoneId'],
                        'DNSName': record_to_update['AliasTarget']['DNSName'],
                        'EvaluateTargetHealth': record_to_update['AliasTarget']['EvaluateTargetHealth'],
                        'S3OriginConfig': {
                            'OriginAccessIdentity': ''
                        }
                    }
                }
            }]
        }
    )
```

That's it! The CloudFront distribution alias record without an S3 origin will now be updated with the correct S3 origin configuration.
