How to enable AWS Config log file delivery

#### Using AWS Console

1. Enable AWS Config: First, enable AWS Config for your AWS account. Sign in to the AWS Management Console, navigate to the AWS Config service, and follow the instructions to enable it. AWS Config will start recording configuration changes and capturing resource configuration snapshots.
2. Configure AWS Config delivery channel: Create a delivery channel for AWS Config to specify where the configuration snapshots and logs will be delivered. In the AWS Config console, go to the Delivery Channel section and configure the destination S3 bucket and other settings for log file delivery. Ensure that the S3 bucket has the required permissions for AWS Config to write log files.
3. Verify S3 bucket permissions: Check that the S3 bucket specified in the delivery channel configuration has the appropriate permissions. The AWS Config service requires write access to the bucket to deliver log files. Make sure that the AWS Config service has the necessary permissions to write to the bucket by configuring the appropriate S3 bucket policy or access control list (ACL).
4. Enable logging for the S3 bucket: In the S3 console, enable server access logging for the bucket to track the delivery of AWS Config log files. This will help you identify any delivery failures or issues. Server access logging can be configured under the Properties tab of the bucket in the S3 console.
5. Monitor and troubleshoot: Regularly monitor the S3 bucket logs and AWS Config delivery status to ensure that log files are being delivered without failures. If there are any delivery failures or errors, review the logs and investigate the cause. Common issues could be related to incorrect bucket permissions, insufficient IAM permissions, or issues with the AWS Config service itself.
