### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Route 53 dashboard.
2. In the Route 53 dashboard, select "Hosted zones" from the left-hand menu.
3. Select the domain name you want to check. This will open a list of all the record sets associated with that domain.
4. Look for any CNAME records that point to an Elastic Beanstalk environment. Check if the Elastic Beanstalk environment is still active. If the environment is inactive but the CNAME record still exists, it indicates a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access Route53 and Elastic Beanstalk.

2. Once AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the hosted zones in your AWS account using the following command:
   ```
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the hosted zones along with their IDs.

3. Now, for each hosted zone, you can list all the record sets using the following command:
   ```
   aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id <HostedZoneId>
   ```
   Replace `<HostedZoneId>` with the ID of the hosted zone you are interested in. This command will return a list of all the record sets in the specified hosted zone.

4. Finally, you need to check if any of the record sets are CNAME records pointing to an Elastic Beanstalk environment. You can do this by looking at the `Type` and `ResourceRecords` fields in the output of the previous command. If the `Type` field is `CNAME` and the `ResourceRecords` field contains a value ending with `.elasticbeanstalk.com`, then the CNAME record is vulnerable.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting up your AWS credentials as environment variables:

```python
import boto3
import os

os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] = 'your_access_key'
os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'
os.environ['AWS_SESSION_TOKEN'] = 'your_session_token' # if you have one
```

3. Create a Route53 client and retrieve all the hosted zones:

```python
route53 = boto3.client('route53')

response = route53.list_hosted_zones()
```

4. Iterate over each hosted zone and check the CNAME records. If the CNAME record points to an Elastic Beanstalk environment, check if it's vulnerable:

```python
for zone in response['HostedZones']:
    record_sets = route53.list_resource_record_sets(HostedZoneId=zone['Id'])
    
    for record_set in record_sets['ResourceRecordSets']:
        if record_set['Type'] == 'CNAME':
            if 'elasticbeanstalk' in record_set['ResourceRecords'][0]['Value']:
                print(f"Vulnerable CNAME record found: {record_set['Name']}")
```

This script will print out the names of all CNAME records that point to an Elastic Beanstalk environment, which could potentially be vulnerable. Please note that this is a basic script and might need to be adjusted based on your specific needs and environment.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the vulnerability of AWS Elastic Beanstalk CNAME Records in AWS Route53 using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the Route53 service.
3. In the Route53 dashboard, select the hosted zone where the Elastic Beanstalk CNAME record is present.
4. Locate the CNAME record associated with your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
5. Click on the CNAME record to select it.
6. Choose the "Actions" dropdown menu and click on "Delete record set" to remove the vulnerable CNAME record.
7. Confirm the deletion by clicking on "Yes, Delete".
8. Once the CNAME record is deleted, you need to create an Alias record to point to the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
9. Click on the "Create record set" button.
10. In the "Name" field, enter the subdomain or hostname you want to associate with the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
11. Set the "Type" field to "A - IPv4 address".
12. Check the "Alias" checkbox.
13. In the "Alias target" field, select your Elastic Beanstalk environment from the dropdown list.
14. Click on the "Create" button to create the Alias record.
15. Verify that the new Alias record is created and points to the correct Elastic Beanstalk environment.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the vulnerability of AWS Elastic Beanstalk CNAME Records in AWS Route53 using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the vulnerability of AWS Elastic Beanstalk CNAME Records in AWS Route53 using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary credentials to access your AWS account.

3. Identify the misconfigured CNAME record associated with your Elastic Beanstalk environment. You can do this by listing the hosted zones in Route53 and locating the relevant Elastic Beanstalk environment.

   Run the following command to list all the hosted zones in Route53:

   ```
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```

   Identify the hosted zone corresponding to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

4. Once you have identified the hosted zone, you need to update the CNAME record to make it more secure. You can achieve this by following these sub-steps:

   a. Get the current record set for the CNAME record using the `list-resource-record-sets` command. Replace `HOSTED_ZONE_ID` with the ID of your hosted zone and `CNAME_RECORD_NAME` with the name of your CNAME record.

      ```
      aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID --query "ResourceRecordSets[?Name == 'CNAME_RECORD_NAME']"
      ```

   b. Make a note of the `TTL`, `Name`, `Type`, and `ResourceRecords` values from the command output.

   c. Delete the existing CNAME record using the `change-resource-record-sets` command. Replace `HOSTED_ZONE_ID` with the ID of your hosted zone and `CNAME_RECORD_NAME` with the name of your CNAME record.

      ```
      aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID --change-batch '{"Changes":[{"Action":"DELETE","ResourceRecordSet":{"Name":"CNAME_RECORD_NAME","Type":"CNAME","TTL":TTL,"ResourceRecords": [{"Value": "EXISTING_VALUE"}]}}]}'
      ```

      Replace `EXISTING_VALUE` with the existing value of the CNAME record.

   d. Create a new CNAME record using the `change-resource-record-sets` command. Replace `HOSTED_ZONE_ID` with the ID of your hosted zone, `CNAME_RECORD_NAME` with the name of your CNAME record, `NEW_VALUE` with the desired value of the CNAME record, and `TTL` with the desired TTL value.

      ```
      aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID --change-batch '{"Changes":[{"Action":"CREATE","ResourceRecordSet":{"Name":"CNAME_RECORD_NAME","Type":"CNAME","TTL":TTL,"ResourceRecords": [{"Value": "NEW_VALUE"}]}}]}'
      ```

      Replace `NEW_VALUE` with the new desired value for the CNAME record.

5. Verify that the CNAME record has been updated successfully by running the `list-resource-record-sets` command again and ensuring that the new record is present.

   ```
   aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID --query "ResourceRecordSets[?Name == 'CNAME_RECORD_NAME']"
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the vulnerability of AWS Elastic Beanstalk CNAME Records in AWS Route53 using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the vulnerability of AWS Elastic Beanstalk CNAME Records, you can follow the steps below using Python:

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```shell
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules in your Python script:
   ```python
   import boto3
   ```

3. Create a function to retrieve the CNAME records for your Elastic Beanstalk environment:
   ```python
   def get_eb_cname_records(environment_name):
       client = boto3.client('elasticbeanstalk')
       response = client.describe_environments(EnvironmentNames=[environment_name])
       cname_records = response['Environments'][0]['CNAME']
       return cname_records
   ```

4. Create a function to delete the CNAME records from AWS Route 53:
   ```python
   def delete_route53_cname_records(cname_records, hosted_zone_id):
       client = boto3.client('route53')
       changes = []
       for cname in cname_records:
           change = {
               'Action': 'DELETE',
               'ResourceRecordSet': {
                   'Name': cname,
                   'Type': 'CNAME',
                   'TTL': 300,
                   'ResourceRecords': [{'Value': cname}]
               }
           }
           changes.append(change)
       response = client.change_resource_record_sets(
           HostedZoneId=hosted_zone_id,
           ChangeBatch={
               'Changes': changes
           }
       )
       return response
   ```

5. Call the functions and pass the required parameters to delete the CNAME records:
   ```python
   environment_name = 'your_environment_name'
   hosted_zone_id = 'your_hosted_zone_id'

   cname_records = get_eb_cname_records(environment_name)
   response = delete_route53_cname_records(cname_records, hosted_zone_id)
   print(response)
   ```

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access Elastic Beanstalk and Route 53 services. Also, replace 'your_environment_name' and 'your_hosted_zone_id' with the appropriate values specific to your environment and hosted zone.

These steps will help you remediate the vulnerability of AWS Elastic Beanstalk CNAME Records by deleting them from AWS Route 53 using Python.
