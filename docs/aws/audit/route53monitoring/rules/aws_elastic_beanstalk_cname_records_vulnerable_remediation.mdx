<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent AWS Elastic Beanstalk CNAME records from being vulnerable in Route 53 using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53:**
   Ensure you have a hosted zone created in Route 53 for your domain. This will help you manage DNS records securely.

   ```sh
   aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name example.com --caller-reference unique-string
   ```

2. **Create a CNAME Record with Proper Configuration:**
   Create a CNAME record in your hosted zone that points to your Elastic Beanstalk environment. Ensure that the CNAME record is correctly configured to avoid vulnerabilities.

   ```sh
   aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE --change-batch '{
     "Changes": [{
       "Action": "CREATE",
       "ResourceRecordSet": {
         "Name": "app.example.com",
         "Type": "CNAME",
         "TTL": 300,
         "ResourceRecords": [{"Value": "my-environment.elasticbeanstalk.com"}]
       }
     }]
   }'
   ```

3. **Enable DNSSEC for the Hosted Zone:**
   Enable DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) for your hosted zone to add an additional layer of security.

   ```sh
   aws route53 enable-hosted-zone-dnssec --hosted-zone-id Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE
   ```

4. **Regularly Audit and Update DNS Records:**
   Regularly audit your DNS records to ensure they are up-to-date and not pointing to deprecated or vulnerable resources. Use the following command to list all records in a hosted zone:

   ```sh
   aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE
   ```

By following these steps, you can help prevent vulnerabilities in your AWS Elastic Beanstalk CNAME records in Route 53 using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent AWS Elastic Beanstalk CNAME records from being vulnerable in Route 53 using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Boto3 Library**:
   Ensure you have the Boto3 library installed, which is the AWS SDK for Python. You can install it using pip if you haven't already.

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by creating a `~/.aws/credentials` file.

3. **Create a Python Script to Check and Update CNAME Records**:
   Write a Python script that uses Boto3 to interact with Route 53 and Elastic Beanstalk. The script will check for existing CNAME records and ensure they are correctly configured.

   ```python
   import boto3

   def get_cname_records():
       client = boto3.client('route53')
       response = client.list_hosted_zones()
       hosted_zones = response['HostedZones']

       for zone in hosted_zones:
           zone_id = zone['Id']
           records = client.list_resource_record_sets(HostedZoneId=zone_id)
           for record in records['ResourceRecordSets']:
               if record['Type'] == 'CNAME':
                   print(f"Found CNAME record: {record['Name']} -> {record['ResourceRecords'][0]['Value']}")

   def update_cname_record(zone_id, record_name, new_value):
       client = boto3.client('route53')
       response = client.change_resource_record_sets(
           HostedZoneId=zone_id,
           ChangeBatch={
               'Changes': [
                   {
                       'Action': 'UPSERT',
                       'ResourceRecordSet': {
                           'Name': record_name,
                           'Type': 'CNAME',
                           'TTL': 300,
                           'ResourceRecords': [{'Value': new_value}]
                       }
                   }
               ]
           }
       )
       print(f"Updated CNAME record: {record_name} -> {new_value}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       get_cname_records()
       # Example usage: update_cname_record('Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE', 'example.com', 'new-value.elasticbeanstalk.com')
   ```

4. **Run the Script and Verify**:
   Execute the script to list all CNAME records and update them as necessary. Ensure that the CNAME records point to the correct Elastic Beanstalk environment and are not left vulnerable.

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

By following these steps, you can automate the process of checking and updating CNAME records in Route 53 to prevent vulnerabilities related to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Route 53 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, select "Hosted zones". This will display a list of all the domains that you manage with Amazon Route 53.
3. Click on the domain name that you want to check. This will open the "Record sets" for that domain.
4. Look for any CNAME records that point to an Elastic Beanstalk environment. Check if the Elastic Beanstalk environment is still active. If the environment is inactive but the CNAME record still exists, it indicates a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install AWS CLI on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all hosted zones: Use the following command to list all the hosted zones in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the hosted zones along with their IDs.

3. List all the record sets for a hosted zone: Once you have the ID of the hosted zone, you can list all the record sets for that hosted zone using the following command:

   ```
   aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id <hosted-zone-id>
   ```
   Replace `<hosted-zone-id>` with the ID of your hosted zone. This command will return a list of all the record sets in the hosted zone.

4. Check for vulnerable CNAME records: Go through the list of record sets and look for any CNAME records that point to an Elastic Beanstalk environment. If the CNAME record is not associated with an active Elastic Beanstalk environment, it is vulnerable. The record sets will be in the following format:

   ```
   {
       "ResourceRecords": [
           {
               "Value": "myapp.elasticbeanstalk.com"
           }
       ],
       "Type": "CNAME",
       "Name": "www.mydomain.com.",
       "TTL": 300
   }
   ```
   If the `Value` field points to an Elastic Beanstalk environment that is not active, the CNAME record is vulnerable.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3` in your terminal.

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the AWS clients for Elastic Beanstalk and Route53. Here's a sample script:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the clients
eb_client = boto3.client('elasticbeanstalk')
route53_client = boto3.client('route53')
```

3. Fetch all the Elastic Beanstalk environments and their CNAMEs, then check if these CNAMEs are present in Route53 hosted zones. Here's a sample script:

```python
# Fetch all Elastic Beanstalk environments
eb_environments = eb_client.describe_environments()

for environment in eb_environments['Environments']:
    # Get the CNAME of the environment
    cname = environment['CNAME']

    # Fetch all Route53 hosted zones
    hosted_zones = route53_client.list_hosted_zones()

    for zone in hosted_zones['HostedZones']:
        # Get the records in the hosted zone
        records = route53_client.list_resource_record_sets(HostedZoneId=zone['Id'])

        for record in records['ResourceRecordSets']:
            # Check if the CNAME is present in the records
            if record['Type'] == 'CNAME' and cname in record['ResourceRecords']:
                print(f"Vulnerable CNAME found: {cname}")
```

4. Run the script. If any Elastic Beanstalk CNAMEs are found in Route53 records, they will be printed out. This indicates a potential misconfiguration, as it means the Elastic Beanstalk environment can be hijacked by adding a record in Route53.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the vulnerability of AWS Elastic Beanstalk CNAME Records in AWS Route53 using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary credentials to access your AWS account.

3. Identify the misconfigured CNAME record associated with your Elastic Beanstalk environment. You can do this by listing the hosted zones in Route53 and locating the relevant Elastic Beanstalk environment.

   Run the following command to list all the hosted zones in Route53:

   ```
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```

   Identify the hosted zone corresponding to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

4. Once you have identified the hosted zone, you need to update the CNAME record to make it more secure. You can achieve this by following these sub-steps:

   a. Get the current record set for the CNAME record using the `list-resource-record-sets` command. Replace `HOSTED_ZONE_ID` with the ID of your hosted zone and `CNAME_RECORD_NAME` with the name of your CNAME record.

      ```
      aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID --query "ResourceRecordSets[?Name == 'CNAME_RECORD_NAME']"
      ```

   b. Make a note of the `TTL`, `Name`, `Type`, and `ResourceRecords` values from the command output.

   c. Delete the existing CNAME record using the `change-resource-record-sets` command. Replace `HOSTED_ZONE_ID` with the ID of your hosted zone and `CNAME_RECORD_NAME` with the name of your CNAME record.

      ```
      aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID --change-batch '{"Changes":[{"Action":"DELETE","ResourceRecordSet":{"Name":"CNAME_RECORD_NAME","Type":"CNAME","TTL":TTL,"ResourceRecords": [{"Value": "EXISTING_VALUE"}]}}]}'
      ```

      Replace `EXISTING_VALUE` with the existing value of the CNAME record.

   d. Create a new CNAME record using the `change-resource-record-sets` command. Replace `HOSTED_ZONE_ID` with the ID of your hosted zone, `CNAME_RECORD_NAME` with the name of your CNAME record, `NEW_VALUE` with the desired value of the CNAME record, and `TTL` with the desired TTL value.

      ```
      aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID --change-batch '{"Changes":[{"Action":"CREATE","ResourceRecordSet":{"Name":"CNAME_RECORD_NAME","Type":"CNAME","TTL":TTL,"ResourceRecords": [{"Value": "NEW_VALUE"}]}}]}'
      ```

      Replace `NEW_VALUE` with the new desired value for the CNAME record.

5. Verify that the CNAME record has been updated successfully by running the `list-resource-record-sets` command again and ensuring that the new record is present.

   ```
   aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID --query "ResourceRecordSets[?Name == 'CNAME_RECORD_NAME']"
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the vulnerability of AWS Elastic Beanstalk CNAME Records in AWS Route53 using AWS CLI.
