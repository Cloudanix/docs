How to create Sender Policy Framework Record for route 53?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Route 53 service.
2. In the navigation panel on the left side, click on "Hosted zones".
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Route 53 Hosted Zones Should Have Sender Policy Framework Record Present" Policy.)
3. Select the hosted zone for the domain where you want to create the SPF record.
4. Click on the "Create record set" button.
5. In the "Create record set" form, enter the following details:
   - Name: Enter the domain name for which you want to create the SPF record (e.g., example.com).
   - Type: Select "TXT - Text".
   - TTL (Seconds): Set the desired time-to-live value for the record.
   - Value: Enter the SPF record value. The SPF record should start with "v=spf1" and include the specific rules for your domain's email authentication. For example, if you want to allow the IP address 123.456.789.0 to send emails on behalf of your domain, the SPF record value would be "v=spf1 ip4:123.456.789.0 -all".
6. Optionally, you can add additional SPF rules as needed for your domain.
7. Click on the "Create" button to create the SPF record.
8. Route 53 will validate the record and update the DNS settings for your domain.
9. It may take some time for the DNS changes to propagate. You can monitor the status of the SPF record in the hosted zone to ensure it is successfully created.
