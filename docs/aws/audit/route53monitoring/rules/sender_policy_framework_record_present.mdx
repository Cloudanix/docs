1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Hosted zones". 

3. In the list of hosted zones, choose the domain that you want to check for SPF record. This will open the "Record sets" for the selected domain.

4. In the "Record sets" section, look for a record with the type "TXT". The value of this record should start with "v=spf1". If such a record exists, then the SPF record is present. If not, then the SPF record is missing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access Route 53 resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the hosted zones in your AWS account using the following command:

   ```
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the hosted zones along with their IDs.

3. For each hosted zone, you can list all the record sets using the following command:

   ```
   aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id <HostedZoneId>
   ```

   Replace `<HostedZoneId>` with the ID of the hosted zone you want to check. This command will return a list of all the record sets in the specified hosted zone.

4. To check if a hosted zone has a Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record, you need to look for a record set where the `Type` is `SPF`. If such a record set exists, then the hosted zone has an SPF record. If not, then it doesn't. You can do this manually or write a script to automate the process. Here is a simple Python script that uses the `boto3` library to do this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a client for Route 53
   client = boto3.client('route53')

   # List all the hosted zones
   response = client.list_hosted_zones()
   for zone in response['HostedZones']:
       # List all the record sets for the hosted zone
       record_sets = client.list_resource_record_sets(HostedZoneId=zone['Id'])
       # Check if there is an SPF record
       has_spf_record = any(record_set['Type'] == 'SPF' for record_set in record_sets['ResourceRecordSets'])
       if not has_spf_record:
           print(f"Hosted zone {zone['Name']} does not have an SPF record.")
   ```
   
   This script will print the names of all the hosted zones that do not have an SPF record.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You can install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the necessary Python modules and initialize the AWS client: You will need to import the Boto3 module and initialize the AWS client to interact with Route 53.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create Route53 client
   route53 = boto3.client('route53')
   ```

3. List all the hosted zones: You can use the `list_hosted_zones()` function to retrieve all the hosted zones.

   ```python
   # List all hosted zones
   response = route53.list_hosted_zones()
   hosted_zones = response['HostedZones']
   ```

4. Check for SPF records: For each hosted zone, you can use the `list_resource_record_sets()` function to retrieve all the record sets. Then, you can iterate over these record sets and check if there is a record set of type 'SPF'. If there is no such record set, then the hosted zone is misconfigured.

   ```python
   for zone in hosted_zones:
       zone_id = zone['Id']
       record_sets = route53.list_resource_record_sets(HostedZoneId=zone_id)
       spf_record_present = any(record_set for record_set in record_sets['ResourceRecordSets'] if record_set['Type'] == 'SPF')
       if not spf_record_present:
           print(f"Hosted zone {zone_id} is misconfigured. No SPF record present.")
   ```
   
This script will print out the IDs of all hosted zones that are misconfigured because they do not have an SPF record.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt and ensure that you have the AWS CLI installed.

2. Run the following command to list all the hosted zones in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```

3. Identify the hosted zone that needs to have the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record present.

4. Create a JSON file with the following information:

   ```
   {
       "Comment": "Add SPF record",
       "Changes": [
           {
               "Action": "UPSERT",
               "ResourceRecordSet": {
                   "Name": "example.com.",
                   "Type": "TXT",
                   "TTL": 300,
                   "ResourceRecords": [
                       {
                           "Value": "\"v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all\""
                       }
                   ]
               }
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   Replace `example.com` with the name of your hosted zone, and `"v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"` with the SPF record you want to add.

5. Run the following command to add the SPF record to the hosted zone:

   ```
   aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID --change-batch file://path/to/file.json
   ```

   Replace `HOSTED_ZONE_ID` with the ID of your hosted zone, and `path/to/file.json` with the path to the JSON file you created in step 4.

6. Verify that the SPF record has been added to the hosted zone by running the following command:

   ```
   aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID
   ```

   Replace `HOSTED_ZONE_ID` with the ID of your hosted zone.

That's it! You have now remediated the misconfiguration by adding an SPF record to the Route 53 hosted zone using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration in AWS Route 53 hosted zones, we need to create a Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record. Here are the step-by-step instructions to do so using Python:

1. First, we need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Next, we need to authenticate our AWS account using AWS access keys. You can set up access keys by going to the AWS IAM console and creating a new user with programmatic access. Once you have the access keys, you can set them up in your Python code using the following snippet:

   ```python
   import boto3

   access_key = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'
   secret_key = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
   region = 'YOUR_REGION'

   client = boto3.client(
       'route53',
       aws_access_key_id=access_key,
       aws_secret_access_key=secret_key,
       region_name=region
   )
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY`, `YOUR_SECRET_KEY`, and `YOUR_REGION` with your own AWS access keys and region.

3. Now, we can create the SPF record using the `change_resource_record_sets` method of the `route53` client. Here's an example code snippet to create an SPF record:

   ```python
   hosted_zone_id = 'YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID'
   domain_name = 'YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME'
   spf_value = '"v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"'

   response = client.change_resource_record_sets(
       HostedZoneId=hosted_zone_id,
       ChangeBatch={
           'Changes': [
               {
                   'Action': 'UPSERT',
                   'ResourceRecordSet': {
                       'Name': domain_name,
                       'Type': 'TXT',
                       'TTL': 300,
                       'ResourceRecords': [
                           {
                               'Value': spf_value
                           }
                       ]
                   }
               }
           ]
       }
   )
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID`, `YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME`, and `spf_value` with your own values. `spf_value` should be set to the SPF record value you want to create.

4. Finally, you can run the Python script to create the SPF record in your AWS Route 53 hosted zone. Once the script has run successfully, you should see the new SPF record in your hosted zone in the AWS console.

   Note: Make sure to test your SPF record to ensure that it is working as expected and not causing any email delivery issues.
