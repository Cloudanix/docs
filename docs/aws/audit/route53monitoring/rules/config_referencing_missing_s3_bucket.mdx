How to ensure AWS Config service is referencing an active S3 bucket.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Config service.
2. Click on "Settings" in the navigation panel on the left side.
3. In the "AWS Config Settings" page, locate the "Amazon S3 bucket" section.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "AWS Config Should Have S3 Bucket Configured" Policy.)
4. Check the current status of the S3 bucket. If there is no active bucket configured, or if the current bucket is no longer available, you will need to specify a new bucket.
5. Click on the "Edit" button next to the "Amazon S3 bucket" section.
6. In the "Specify an Amazon S3 bucket for storing configuration history" dialog, select the option to "Use an existing S3 bucket" or "Create a new S3 bucket."
   a. If you select "Use an existing S3 bucket," choose the appropriate S3 bucket from the dropdown menu.
   b. If you select "Create a new S3 bucket," follow the prompts to create a new bucket with the desired settings and permissions.
7. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.
8. Once the changes are saved, AWS Config will start using the specified S3 bucket for storing configuration history and snapshots.
9. Monitor the status of the S3 bucket in the AWS Config Settings page to ensure that it remains active and accessible.
