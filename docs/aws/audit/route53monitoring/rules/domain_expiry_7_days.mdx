### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent Route 53 domain expiry in 7 days using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Auto-Renewal:**
   - Open the [Amazon Route 53 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/).
   - In the navigation pane, choose **Registered Domains**.
   - Select the domain that is nearing expiry.
   - In the **Domain details** section, ensure that the **Auto Renew** option is enabled. If it is not, click **Enable Auto Renew**.

2. **Update Contact Information:**
   - While still in the **Registered Domains** section, select the domain.
   - Verify that the contact information is up-to-date. This ensures that you receive renewal notifications.
   - Update any outdated contact information by clicking **Edit** next to the contact details.

3. **Set Up Billing Alerts:**
   - Go to the [AWS Billing and Cost Management Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home).
   - In the navigation pane, choose **Billing preferences**.
   - Enable billing alerts to receive notifications about your AWS charges, which can help ensure you have sufficient funds for domain renewals.

4. **Monitor Domain Expiry Notifications:**
   - Regularly check your email for notifications from AWS regarding domain expiry.
   - Ensure that these emails are not being filtered into spam or junk folders.

By following these steps, you can help ensure that your Route 53 domains do not expire unexpectedly.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent Route 53 domain expiry in 7 days using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check Domain Expiry Date:**
   Use the `list-domains` command to list all your domains and their expiry dates. This helps you identify which domains are nearing expiry.
   ```sh
   aws route53domains list-domains
   ```

2. **Enable Auto-Renewal:**
   Ensure that auto-renewal is enabled for your domain. This will automatically renew your domain before it expires.
   ```sh
   aws route53domains enable-domain-auto-renew --domain-name example.com
   ```

3. **Update Contact Information:**
   Make sure your contact information is up-to-date to receive renewal notifications. Update the contact information if necessary.
   ```sh
   aws route53domains update-domain-contact --domain-name example.com --admin-contact Name=AdminName,Email=admin@example.com,PhoneNumber=+1234567890
   ```

4. **Set Up Billing Alerts:**
   Configure billing alerts to notify you of upcoming charges, including domain renewals. This can be done through AWS Budgets.
   ```sh
   aws budgets create-budget --account-id 123456789012 --budget file://budget.json
   ```
   Here, `budget.json` should contain the budget configuration, including thresholds for notifications.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Route 53 domains do not expire unexpectedly.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent Route 53 domain expiry in 7 days using Python scripts, you can automate the monitoring and renewal process. Here are the steps to achieve this:

### Step 1: Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)
First, ensure you have Boto3 installed and configured with the necessary AWS credentials.

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### Step 2: Create a Python Script to Check Domain Expiry

Create a Python script to check the expiry date of your Route 53 domains. This script will list all domains and their expiry dates.

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize a session using Amazon Route 53
client = boto3.client('route53domains')

# Function to check domain expiry
def check_domain_expiry():
    response = client.list_domains()
    domains = response['Domains']
    
    for domain in domains:
        domain_name = domain['DomainName']
        expiry_date = domain['Expiry']
        
        # Calculate the days until expiry
        days_until_expiry = (expiry_date - datetime.now().date()).days
        
        if days_until_expiry <= 7:
            print(f"Domain {domain_name} is expiring in {days_until_expiry} days.")
            # Here you can add logic to renew the domain or send a notification

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_domain_expiry()
```

### Step 3: Automate Domain Renewal

Extend the script to automatically renew the domain if it is expiring within 7 days.

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize a session using Amazon Route 53
client = boto3.client('route53domains')

# Function to check domain expiry and renew if necessary
def check_and_renew_domain():
    response = client.list_domains()
    domains = response['Domains']
    
    for domain in domains:
        domain_name = domain['DomainName']
        expiry_date = domain['Expiry']
        
        # Calculate the days until expiry
        days_until_expiry = (expiry_date - datetime.now().date()).days
        
        if days_until_expiry <= 7:
            print(f"Domain {domain_name} is expiring in {days_until_expiry} days. Renewing now.")
            renew_domain(domain_name)

# Function to renew a domain
def renew_domain(domain_name):
    try:
        response = client.renew_domain(
            DomainName=domain_name,
            DurationInYears=1
        )
        print(f"Domain {domain_name} renewed successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to renew domain {domain_name}: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_and_renew_domain()
```

### Step 4: Schedule the Script

Use a scheduling tool like cron (on Unix-based systems) or Task Scheduler (on Windows) to run the script periodically (e.g., daily) to ensure continuous monitoring and renewal.

#### Example Cron Job (runs daily at midnight):
```bash
0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py
```

By following these steps, you can automate the monitoring and renewal of your Route 53 domains, preventing them from expiring.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Route 53 dashboard. You can do this by typing "Route 53" into the search bar at the top of the console and selecting it from the dropdown menu.
3. Once you're in the Route 53 dashboard, click on "Registered domains" in the left-hand menu. This will bring up a list of all the domains you have registered with Route 53.
4. Check the "Expiration date" column for each domain. If a domain is set to expire in the next 7 days, it will be listed here.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all the hosted zones: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the hosted zones in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the hosted zones along with their details.

3. List all the domain names: For each hosted zone, use the following AWS CLI command to list all the domain names:

   ```
   aws route53domains list-domains
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the domain names along with their details.

4. Check the expiry date: For each domain name, check the Expiry date. If the Expiry date is within the next 7 days, then the domain is about to expire. You can do this by parsing the output of the previous command using a script. Here is a simple Python script that does this:

   ```python
   import json
   import datetime

   # Load the output of the 'aws route53domains list-domains' command
   with open('domains.json') as f:
       domains = json.load(f)

   # Check each domain
   for domain in domains['Domains']:
       # Parse the expiry date
       expiry_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(domain['Expiry'], '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')
       # Check if the domain is about to expire
       if (expiry_date - datetime.datetime.now()).days <= 7:
           print(f"The domain {domain['DomainName']} is about to expire")
   ```
   Replace 'domains.json' with the actual path to the file containing the output of the 'aws route53domains list-domains' command.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the Boto3 library. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials: Before you can interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a file at ~/.aws/credentials. At the very least, the contents of the file should be:

   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check the domain expiry date: Here is a simple script that uses Boto3 to interact with Route 53 and check the domain expiry date.

   ```python
   import boto3
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Create a client
   route53domains = boto3.client('route53domains')

   # Get a list of all domains
   domains = route53domains.list_domains()

   # Check each domain
   for domain in domains['Domains']:
       # Get the domain info
       info = route53domains.get_domain_detail(DomainName=domain['DomainName'])
       # Get the expiry date
       expiry = info['Expiry']
       # Check if the domain expires in less than 7 days
       if expiry - datetime.now() < timedelta(days=7):
           print(f"The domain {domain['DomainName']} expires in less than 7 days!")
   ```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using the Python interpreter. If the script prints out any domain names, those domains are set to expire in less than 7 days. If no domain names are printed, none of your domains are set to expire in the next week.

   ```
   python check_expiry.py
   ```

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the Route 53 Domain Expiry in 7 days issue in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the `boto3` library using the following command:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Create an AWS IAM user with Route53 read-only access and generate the access key and secret key.

3. Create a Python script with the following code:

```
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Set the AWS access key and secret key
access_key = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'
secret_key = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'

# Create a Route53 client
client = boto3.client('route53', aws_access_key_id=access_key, aws_secret_access_key=secret_key)

# Get all the hosted zones
response = client.list_hosted_zones()

# Loop through each hosted zone
for zone in response['HostedZones']:
    zone_id = zone['Id']
    zone_name = zone['Name']

    # Get the details of the hosted zone
    zone_details = client.get_hosted_zone(Id=zone_id)

    # Get the expiration date of the domain
    domain_expiration_date = zone_details['DelegationSet']['NameServers'][0].split('.')[0]

    # Calculate the number of days left for the domain to expire
    days_left = (datetime.strptime(domain_expiration_date, '%Y%m%d') - datetime.now()).days

    # If the domain is expiring in 7 days or less, update the domain
    if days_left <= 7:
        # Update the domain registration
        response = client.update_domain_registration(
            DomainName=zone_name
        )

        # Print the status of the update
        print(f"Domain registration for {zone_name} has been updated. Status: {response['OperationStatus']}")
```

4. Replace the `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY` and `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` placeholders with the actual access key and secret key.

5. Run the script using the following command:

```
python remediate_route53_expiry.py
```
