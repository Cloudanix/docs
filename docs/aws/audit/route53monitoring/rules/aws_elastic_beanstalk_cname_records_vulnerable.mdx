1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Route 53 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, select "Hosted zones". This will display a list of all the domains that you manage with Amazon Route 53.
3. Click on the domain name that you want to check. This will open the "Record sets" for that domain.
4. Look for any CNAME records that point to an Elastic Beanstalk environment. Check if the Elastic Beanstalk environment is still active. If the environment is inactive but the CNAME record still exists, it indicates a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install AWS CLI on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all hosted zones: Use the following command to list all the hosted zones in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the hosted zones along with their IDs.

3. List all the record sets for a hosted zone: Once you have the ID of the hosted zone, you can list all the record sets for that hosted zone using the following command:

   ```
   aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id <hosted-zone-id>
   ```
   Replace `<hosted-zone-id>` with the ID of your hosted zone. This command will return a list of all the record sets in the hosted zone.

4. Check for vulnerable CNAME records: Go through the list of record sets and look for any CNAME records that point to an Elastic Beanstalk environment. If the CNAME record is not associated with an active Elastic Beanstalk environment, it is vulnerable. The record sets will be in the following format:

   ```
   {
       "ResourceRecords": [
           {
               "Value": "myapp.elasticbeanstalk.com"
           }
       ],
       "Type": "CNAME",
       "Name": "www.mydomain.com.",
       "TTL": 300
   }
   ```
   If the `Value` field points to an Elastic Beanstalk environment that is not active, the CNAME record is vulnerable.

1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3` in your terminal.

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the AWS clients for Elastic Beanstalk and Route53. Here's a sample script:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the clients
eb_client = boto3.client('elasticbeanstalk')
route53_client = boto3.client('route53')
```

3. Fetch all the Elastic Beanstalk environments and their CNAMEs, then check if these CNAMEs are present in Route53 hosted zones. Here's a sample script:

```python
# Fetch all Elastic Beanstalk environments
eb_environments = eb_client.describe_environments()

for environment in eb_environments['Environments']:
    # Get the CNAME of the environment
    cname = environment['CNAME']

    # Fetch all Route53 hosted zones
    hosted_zones = route53_client.list_hosted_zones()

    for zone in hosted_zones['HostedZones']:
        # Get the records in the hosted zone
        records = route53_client.list_resource_record_sets(HostedZoneId=zone['Id'])

        for record in records['ResourceRecordSets']:
            # Check if the CNAME is present in the records
            if record['Type'] == 'CNAME' and cname in record['ResourceRecords']:
                print(f"Vulnerable CNAME found: {cname}")
```

4. Run the script. If any Elastic Beanstalk CNAMEs are found in Route53 records, they will be printed out. This indicates a potential misconfiguration, as it means the Elastic Beanstalk environment can be hijacked by adding a record in Route53.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the vulnerability of AWS Elastic Beanstalk CNAME Records in AWS Route53 using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary credentials to access your AWS account.

3. Identify the misconfigured CNAME record associated with your Elastic Beanstalk environment. You can do this by listing the hosted zones in Route53 and locating the relevant Elastic Beanstalk environment.

   Run the following command to list all the hosted zones in Route53:

   ```
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```

   Identify the hosted zone corresponding to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

4. Once you have identified the hosted zone, you need to update the CNAME record to make it more secure. You can achieve this by following these sub-steps:

   a. Get the current record set for the CNAME record using the `list-resource-record-sets` command. Replace `HOSTED_ZONE_ID` with the ID of your hosted zone and `CNAME_RECORD_NAME` with the name of your CNAME record.

      ```
      aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID --query "ResourceRecordSets[?Name == 'CNAME_RECORD_NAME']"
      ```

   b. Make a note of the `TTL`, `Name`, `Type`, and `ResourceRecords` values from the command output.

   c. Delete the existing CNAME record using the `change-resource-record-sets` command. Replace `HOSTED_ZONE_ID` with the ID of your hosted zone and `CNAME_RECORD_NAME` with the name of your CNAME record.

      ```
      aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID --change-batch '{"Changes":[{"Action":"DELETE","ResourceRecordSet":{"Name":"CNAME_RECORD_NAME","Type":"CNAME","TTL":TTL,"ResourceRecords": [{"Value": "EXISTING_VALUE"}]}}]}'
      ```

      Replace `EXISTING_VALUE` with the existing value of the CNAME record.

   d. Create a new CNAME record using the `change-resource-record-sets` command. Replace `HOSTED_ZONE_ID` with the ID of your hosted zone, `CNAME_RECORD_NAME` with the name of your CNAME record, `NEW_VALUE` with the desired value of the CNAME record, and `TTL` with the desired TTL value.

      ```
      aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID --change-batch '{"Changes":[{"Action":"CREATE","ResourceRecordSet":{"Name":"CNAME_RECORD_NAME","Type":"CNAME","TTL":TTL,"ResourceRecords": [{"Value": "NEW_VALUE"}]}}]}'
      ```

      Replace `NEW_VALUE` with the new desired value for the CNAME record.

5. Verify that the CNAME record has been updated successfully by running the `list-resource-record-sets` command again and ensuring that the new record is present.

   ```
   aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id HOSTED_ZONE_ID --query "ResourceRecordSets[?Name == 'CNAME_RECORD_NAME']"
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the vulnerability of AWS Elastic Beanstalk CNAME Records in AWS Route53 using AWS CLI.

   import boto3
   ```

3. Create a function to retrieve the CNAME records for your Elastic Beanstalk environment:
   ```python
   def get_eb_cname_records(environment_name):
       client = boto3.client('elasticbeanstalk')
       response = client.describe_environments(EnvironmentNames=[environment_name])
       cname_records = response['Environments'][0]['CNAME']
       return cname_records
   ```

4. Create a function to delete the CNAME records from AWS Route 53:
   ```python
   def delete_route53_cname_records(cname_records, hosted_zone_id):
       client = boto3.client('route53')
       changes = []
       for cname in cname_records:
           change = {
               'Action': 'DELETE',
               'ResourceRecordSet': {
                   'Name': cname,
                   'Type': 'CNAME',
                   'TTL': 300,
                   'ResourceRecords': [{'Value': cname}]
               }
           }
           changes.append(change)
       response = client.change_resource_record_sets(
           HostedZoneId=hosted_zone_id,
           ChangeBatch={
               'Changes': changes
           }
       )
       return response
   ```

5. Call the functions and pass the required parameters to delete the CNAME records:
   ```python
   environment_name = 'your_environment_name'
   hosted_zone_id = 'your_hosted_zone_id'

   cname_records = get_eb_cname_records(environment_name)
   response = delete_route53_cname_records(cname_records, hosted_zone_id)
   print(response)
   ```

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access Elastic Beanstalk and Route 53 services. Also, replace 'your_environment_name' and 'your_hosted_zone_id' with the appropriate values specific to your environment and hosted zone.

These steps will help you remediate the vulnerability of AWS Elastic Beanstalk CNAME Records by deleting them from AWS Route 53 using Python.
