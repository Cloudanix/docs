### Remediation

#### Using Console

Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration of "Excessive Number of Security Groups Should Not Be Present" in AWS:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Click on the "Security Groups" option in the left-hand menu.
4. Review the list of security groups and identify any that are no longer needed or are redundant.
5. Select the redundant security groups by clicking the checkbox next to them.
6. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Delete security group".
7. A confirmation window will appear, click "Yes, Delete" to confirm the deletion of the selected security groups.

Repeat steps 5-7 for any additional redundant security groups.

By removing any unnecessary or redundant security groups, you can reduce the number of security groups in your AWS environment and minimize the risk of misconfigurations or security breaches.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the excessive number of security groups issue in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and ensure that you have AWS CLI installed and configured with the appropriate credentials.

2. Run the following command to list all the security groups in the region:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[*].{Name:GroupName,ID:GroupId}'
```

3. Review the list of security groups to identify any groups that are no longer needed or are redundant. Note down the IDs of these security groups.

4. Run the following command to delete the identified security groups:

```
aws ec2 delete-security-group --group-id <security-group-id>
```

Replace `<security-group-id>` with the actual ID of the security group that needs to be deleted.

5. Repeat step 4 for all the security groups that need to be deleted.

6. Run the following command to verify that the security groups have been deleted:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[*].{Name:GroupName,ID:GroupId}'
```

This should return a list of security groups that does not include the deleted groups.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of excessive number of security groups in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the excessive number of security groups in AWS, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to write a Python script that will perform the following steps:

1. Use the `boto3.client('ec2')` method to create an EC2 client object.
2. Use the `describe_security_groups()` method of the EC2 client object to retrieve a list of all security groups.
3. Use the `len()` function to count the number of security groups returned by the `describe_security_groups()` method.
4. If the number of security groups is excessive, use the `delete_security_group()` method of the EC2 client object to delete the unnecessary security groups.

Here is the sample Python code to remediate the excessive number of security groups in AWS:

```
import boto3

# Create an EC2 client object
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Retrieve a list of all security groups
security_groups = ec2.describe_security_groups()

# Count the number of security groups
num_security_groups = len(security_groups['SecurityGroups'])

# Define the maximum number of security groups
max_security_groups = 10

# If the number of security groups is excessive, delete the unnecessary security groups
if num_security_groups > max_security_groups:
    # Get a list of the security group IDs to delete
    security_group_ids = [sg['GroupId'] for sg in security_groups['SecurityGroups'][max_security_groups:]]
    
    # Delete the unnecessary security groups
    for sg_id in security_group_ids:
        ec2.delete_security_group(GroupId=sg_id)
```

Note: You should adjust the value of `max_security_groups` to the appropriate maximum number of security groups for your environment.
