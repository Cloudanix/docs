### Remediation

How to remediate if MQ brokers are publicly accessible

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the affected MQ brokers:
   - Navigate to the Amazon MQ service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the "Brokers" section.
   - Identify the brokers that are publicly accessible.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "MQ Broker Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" Policy.)
2. Update the security group rules:
   - Select the affected MQ broker.
   - Look at the associated security group(s) for the broker.
   - Remove or modify the inbound rule(s) that allow public access (typically using the source IP or CIDR range).
3. Verify the changes:
   - Confirm that the security group rules for public access have been removed or modified accordingly.
   - Test the connectivity to the MQ broker from a different network or source to ensure that it is no longer publicly accessible.
4. Repeat for other affected MQ brokers:
   - If you have multiple MQ brokers that are publicly accessible, repeat the steps above to update the security group rules for each affected broker.
