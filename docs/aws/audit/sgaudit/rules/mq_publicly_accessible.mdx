### More Info:

MQ brokers should not be launched into public cloud. Unless there is a specific business requirement, MQ Brokers should not have a public endpoint and should be accessed from within a VPC only.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "MQ Broker Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" for AWS using the AWS console, please follow the steps below:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon MQ service.
3. Select the broker that you want to remediate from the list of brokers.
4. Click on the "Edit" button to edit the broker's configuration.
5. Under the "Network & Security" section, you will see the "Publicly Accessible" option. 
6. Set the "Publicly Accessible" option to "No".
7. Click on the "Save Changes" button to apply the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, the MQ Broker will no longer be publicly accessible.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of an MQ Broker being publicly accessible in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Verify that the MQ Broker is publicly accessible by running the following command:

   ```
   aws mq describe-broker --broker-id <broker-id>
   ```

   If the `PubliclyAccessible` parameter is set to `true`, then the broker is publicly accessible.

2. To make the MQ Broker private, run the following command:

   ```
   aws mq update-broker --broker-id <broker-id> --publicly-accessible false
   ```

   This command will update the `PubliclyAccessible` parameter of the broker to `false`, making it private and not publicly accessible.

3. Verify that the MQ Broker is now private by running the `describe-broker` command again:

   ```
   aws mq describe-broker --broker-id <broker-id>
   ```

   If the `PubliclyAccessible` parameter is set to `false`, then the broker is now private and not publicly accessible.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of an MQ Broker being publicly accessible in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "MQ Broker Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" for AWS, you can use the following steps using Python:

1. First, you need to identify the Amazon MQ brokers that are publicly accessible in your AWS account. You can use the Boto3 library in Python to list all the Amazon MQ brokers in your account.

```python
import boto3

# Create an Amazon MQ client
mq_client = boto3.client('mq')

# List all the Amazon MQ brokers in your account
response = mq_client.list_brokers()
for broker in response['BrokerSummaries']:
    # Check if the broker is publicly accessible
    if broker['PubliclyAccessible']:
        # Take remediation action
```

2. Once you have identified the publicly accessible Amazon MQ brokers, you need to update their security group to restrict access only to authorized IPs. You can use the Boto3 library in Python to update the security group of the Amazon MQ brokers.

```python
import boto3

# Create an Amazon EC2 client
ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

# Update the security group of the Amazon MQ broker to restrict access only to authorized IPs
response = ec2_client.authorize_security_group_ingress(
    GroupId='sg-xxxxxxxx',
    IpPermissions=[
        {
            'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
            'FromPort': 61614,
            'ToPort': 61614,
            'IpRanges': [
                {
                    'CidrIp': 'x.x.x.x/32'
                },
            ]
        },
    ]
)
```

In the above code, replace `sg-xxxxxxxx` with the security group ID of the Amazon MQ broker that needs to be remediated. Replace `x.x.x.x/32` with the authorized IP address that should be allowed to access the broker.

3. Finally, you can verify that the Amazon MQ broker is no longer publicly accessible by checking its `PubliclyAccessible` attribute. You can use the Boto3 library in Python to get the details of the Amazon MQ broker.

```python
import boto3

# Create an Amazon MQ client
mq_client = boto3.client('mq')

# Get the details of the Amazon MQ broker
response = mq_client.describe_broker(
    BrokerId='broker-id'
)

# Check if the broker is publicly accessible
if not response['Broker']['PubliclyAccessible']:
    print('Broker is no longer publicly accessible')
```

In the above code, replace `broker-id` with the ID of the Amazon MQ broker that was remediated.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "MQ Broker Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" for AWS using Python.
