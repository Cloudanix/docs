### More Info:

Security groups should not have all ports or protocols open to the public. Security groups should be created on a per-service basis and avoid allowing all ports or protocols.

### Remediation

How to remediate if EC2 instances have ports open to public

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the EC2 instances with open ports:
   - Navigate to the EC2 service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the "Instances" section.
   - Identify the EC2 instances that have open ports accessible from the Internet.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Ports Should Not Be Open for External Traffic" Policy.)
2. Update security group rules:
   - Select the EC2 instance that has open ports.
   - Note the associated security group(s) for the instance.
   - Go to the "Security Groups" section in the EC2 service.
   - Locate the security group(s) associated with the instance.
   - Edit the inbound rules of the security group(s) to restrict access to the desired ports or remove unnecessary rules.
   - Remove any rules that allow unrestricted access from the Internet (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0).
   - Make sure to specify the specific IP ranges or trusted sources that require access to the instance.
3. Verify the changes:
   - Double-check that the security group rules have been updated to restrict access to the desired ports.
   - Confirm that the instance no longer has ports open to the public.
4. Test connectivity:
   - Test the connectivity to the EC2 instance from both internal and external sources to ensure that access is properly restricted.
5. Monitor and enforce security practices:
   - Regularly review your EC2 instances and their associated security groups to ensure they remain secure.
   - Implement security best practices, such as using private subnets, network ACLs, and VPC flow logs to enhance the security of your instances.
