### More Info:

Security groups should not have all ports or protocols open to the public. Security groups should be created on a per-service basis and avoid allowing all ports or protocols.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of having ports open for external traffic in AWS, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.

3. Select the EC2 instance for which you want to close the open ports.

4. Click on the Security Groups option in the left-hand menu.

5. Select the security group that is associated with the EC2 instance.

6. Click on the Inbound Rules tab.

7. Locate the rule that is allowing external traffic to access the port(s) that you want to close.

8. Click on the "X" button next to the rule to delete it.

9. Click on the Save button to apply the changes.

This will close the open ports for external traffic and prevent any unauthorized access to your EC2 instance.

#### Using CLI

Step-by-Step instructions to remediate the issue "Ports Should Not Be Open for External Traffic" in AWS using AWS CLI:

1. Login to your AWS account using AWS CLI.
2. Identify the Security Group that has the open port(s) for external traffic.
3. Get the Security Group ID.
4. Run the following command to revoke the ingress rule that allows external traffic for the identified Security Group:

```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <Security-Group-ID> --protocol tcp --port <Port-Number> --cidr <IP-Address>/<CIDR-Block>
```

Note: Replace `<Security-Group-ID>` with the actual Security Group ID, `<Port-Number>` with the actual port number that is open for external traffic, and `<IP-Address>/<CIDR-Block>` with the actual IP address range that is allowed to access the port.

5. Verify that the ingress rule has been revoked by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <Security-Group-ID>
```

Note: Replace `<Security-Group-ID>` with the actual Security Group ID.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for all the open ports that are accessible to external traffic.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue "Ports Should Not Be Open for External Traffic" in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of ports being open for external traffic in AWS using Python, you can use the Boto3 library which is the official AWS SDK for Python. Here are the steps to remediate the misconfiguration:

1. First, you need to identify the security groups that have open ports for external traffic. You can use the following code to list all the security groups in your AWS account:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('ec2')

response = client.describe_security_groups()

for sg in response['SecurityGroups']:
    print(sg['GroupId'], sg['GroupName'])
```

2. Once you have identified the security groups, you can use the following code to revoke the ingress rules that allow external traffic to access the open ports:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('ec2')

# Replace the security group id and port number with your own values
response = client.revoke_security_group_ingress(
    GroupId='sg-xxxxxxxx',
    IpPermissions=[
        {
            'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
            'FromPort': 80,
            'ToPort': 80,
            'IpRanges': [
                {
                    'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'
                },
            ],
        },
    ]
)

print(response)
```

In the above code, you need to replace the `GroupId` with the ID of the security group that has open ports for external traffic. You also need to specify the port number and IP protocol that you want to revoke access to.

3. You can also use the following code to revoke all ingress rules that allow external traffic to access the open ports:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('ec2')

# Replace the security group id with your own value
response = client.revoke_security_group_egress(
    GroupId='sg-xxxxxxxx',
    IpPermissions=[
        {
            'IpProtocol': '-1',
            'IpRanges': [
                {
                    'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'
                },
            ],
        },
    ]
)

print(response)
```

In the above code, you need to replace the `GroupId` with the ID of the security group that has open ports for external traffic. The `IpProtocol` is set to `-1` which means all protocols are included. The `IpRanges` are set to `0.0.0.0/0` which means all IP addresses are included.

Note: These codes are just examples and you need to modify them according to your specific use case. Also, make sure to test the remediation before applying it to production environments.
