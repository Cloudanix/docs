How to block public access to default security groups

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify default security groups:
   - Navigate to the EC2 service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the "Security Groups" section.
   - Identify the default security groups named "default" in each region.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Default Security Group Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" Policy.)
2. Update inbound rules to deny public access:
   - Select a default security group.
   - Click on the "Inbound Rules" tab.
   - Edit the inbound rules to deny public access by removing or modifying any rules that allow inbound traffic from the Internet.
   - Ensure that only necessary inbound rules remain in place, and they are restricted to specific trusted sources.
3. Update outbound rules to deny public access:
   - Click on the "Outbound Rules" tab.
   - Edit the outbound rules to deny public access by removing or modifying any rules that allow outbound traffic to the Internet.
   - Ensure that only necessary outbound rules remain in place, and they are restricted to specific trusted destinations.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all default security groups:
   - Repeat the process of selecting a default security group, updating its inbound and outbound rules to deny public access, and verifying the changes.
   - Ensure that you perform these steps for all default security groups in each region.
5. Verify the changes:
   - Double-check that all default security groups have been updated to deny public access both for inbound and outbound traffic.
   - Validate that the rules only allow necessary traffic from trusted sources and destinations.

By following these steps, you can block public access to the default security groups in your AWS account. It helps ensure that the default security groups are properly secured and prevent unauthorized access from the Internet.
