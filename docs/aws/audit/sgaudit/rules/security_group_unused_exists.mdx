How to remove unused Security Groups

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
2. From the left navigation pane, click on "Security Groups" to view the list of security groups.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Unused Security Groups Should Be Removed" Policy.)
3. Review the list of security groups and identify the ones that are unused and no longer needed.
4. Before deleting a security group, ensure that it is not associated with any instances or other resources. If it is associated, you will need to remove those associations before deletion.
5. To check the associations of a security group, click on its name in the list to view its details.
6. In the "Details" tab of the security group, review the "Inbound Rules" and "Outbound Rules" sections to see if any instances or resources are using it.
7. To remove associations, navigate to the appropriate service (e.g., EC2 instances, RDS instances) and modify the resource configurations to use a different security group.
8. Once you have confirmed that the security group is not associated with any resources, select the security group in the list.
9. Click on the "Actions" button and choose "Delete Security Group" from the dropdown menu.
10. Confirm the deletion when prompted.
11. Repeat the steps for each unused security group that you want to remove.
