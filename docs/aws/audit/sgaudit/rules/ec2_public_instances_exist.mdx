### More Info:

Unknown EC2 instances should not be publicly accessible. It is good practice to maintain a list of known, publicly accessible instances and flag all other instances that meet this criteria.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

HIPAA, NIST, SOC2

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the "EC2 instances should not be publicly accessible" misconfiguration for AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 service.
3. Click on the "Instances" option from the left-hand menu.
4. Select the instance that you want to remediate.
5. In the bottom panel, click on the "Description" tab.
6. Look for the "Security groups" section and click on the security group associated with the instance.
7. In the "Inbound rules" tab, identify the rule that allows public access to the instance. This could be either an SSH or RDP rule that allows traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 or a rule that allows HTTP/HTTPS traffic from anywhere.
8. Click on the "Edit" button to modify the inbound rule.
9. Change the source IP address or IP range to a specific IP address or IP range that you trust. Alternatively, you can remove the rule altogether if it's not needed.
10. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

After following these steps, your instance will no longer be publicly accessible. It's important to regularly review your security groups to ensure that only necessary traffic is allowed to your instances.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of EC2 instances being publicly accessible in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

Step 2: Run the following command to get a list of all the EC2 instances in your AWS account:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,PublicIpAddress,State.Name]' --output text
```

This will give you a list of all the EC2 instances in your account along with their instance ID, public IP address, and current state.

Step 3: Identify the instances that are publicly accessible by looking at their public IP addresses.

Step 4: To remediate this, you need to remove the public IP address from the instance. To do this, you can modify the security group associated with the instance and remove the inbound rule that allows traffic from any IP address. 

You can use the following command to modify the security group:

```
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance_id> --no-source-dest-check
```

Replace `<instance_id>` with the ID of the instance you want to modify.

This command will remove the source/destination check for the instance, which means that the instance will no longer have a public IP address and will not be publicly accessible.

Step 5: Verify that the instance is no longer publicly accessible by running the `describe-instances` command again and checking the public IP address of the instance.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of EC2 instances being publicly accessible in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of EC2 instances being publicly accessible in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Identify the publicly accessible EC2 instances using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) by checking the value of the "PublicIpAddress" attribute of each instance.

2. For each instance that has a public IP address, modify its security group to remove the inbound rule that allows public access.

3. To remove the inbound rule using Python, use the following code snippet:

```
import boto3

# Create EC2 client
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Specify the security group ID and the IP protocol (TCP or UDP)
security_group_id = 'YOUR_SECURITY_GROUP_ID'
ip_protocol = 'tcp'

# Specify the port range to be removed from the inbound rule
from_port = 0
to_port = 65535

# Specify the CIDR range of the inbound rule to be removed
cidr_ip = '0.0.0.0/0'

# Remove the inbound rule from the security group
response = ec2.revoke_security_group_ingress(
    GroupId=security_group_id,
    IpProtocol=ip_protocol,
    FromPort=from_port,
    ToPort=to_port,
    CidrIp=cidr_ip
)
```

4. Repeat the above steps for all the publicly accessible EC2 instances in your AWS account.

5. To prevent future EC2 instances from being publicly accessible, you can create a custom AWS Config rule that checks for the "PublicIpAddress" attribute of all EC2 instances and flags any that have a public IP address. You can then use AWS Lambda to automatically modify the security group of any flagged instances to remove the inbound rule that allows public access.
