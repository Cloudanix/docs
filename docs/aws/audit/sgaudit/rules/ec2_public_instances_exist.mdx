### Remediation

How to remediate if EC2 instances are publicly accessible

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the publicly accessible EC2 instances:
   - Navigate to the EC2 service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the "Instances" section.
   - Identify the EC2 instances that have public IP addresses assigned.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "EC2 instances Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" Policy.)
2. Remove public IP addresses:
   - Select the EC2 instance that you want to make private.
   - Click on the "Actions" button and choose "Networking" > "Manage IP Addresses".
   - In the "Manage IP Addresses" dialog, select the public IP address and click on the "Disassociate" button.
   - Confirm the disassociation of the public IP address.
   - Repeat this step for all publicly accessible EC2 instances.
3. Configure security groups:
   - Review the security groups associated with your EC2 instances.
   - Modify the inbound rules of the security groups to allow access only from trusted sources or specific IP ranges that require access to the instances.
   - Remove any rules that allow unrestricted access from the Internet (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0).
4. Verify the changes:
   - Double-check that the public IP addresses have been removed from the EC2 instances.
   - Confirm that the security groups have been properly configured to restrict access to the instances.
