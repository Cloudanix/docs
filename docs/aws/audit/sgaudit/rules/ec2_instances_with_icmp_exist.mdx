### Remediation

How to remediate if EC2 instances have ICMP ports open

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the affected EC2 instances:
   - Navigate to the EC2 service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the "Instances" section.
   - Identify the instances that have ICMP ports open.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "EC2 Instance Should Not Have Open ICMP ports" Policy.)
2. Update the security group rules:
   - Select the instance you want to modify.
   - Look at the associated security group(s) for the instance.
   - Remove the inbound rule(s) that allow ICMP traffic (typically using ICMP protocol or "All ICMP" option).
3. Verify the changes:
   - Confirm that the security group rules for ICMP traffic have been removed or modified accordingly.
   - Test the connectivity to the instance from a different network or source to ensure that ICMP traffic is blocked.
4. Repeat for other affected instances:
   - If you have multiple instances with open ICMP ports, repeat the steps above to update the security group rules for each affected instance.
