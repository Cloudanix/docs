### More Info:

Maintaining unused resources increases risks of misconfigurations and increases the difficulty of audits. Unused Network ACLs should therefore be discarded.

### Risk Level

Low

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

CBP

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Unused Network ACLs Should Be Removed" in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the VPC service.

2. In the left navigation pane, select "Network ACLs".

3. Review the list of Network ACLs and identify the ones that are not being used.

4. Select the Network ACL that is not being used.

5. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Delete".

6. In the confirmation dialog box, click on "Yes, Delete".

7. Repeat steps 4-6 for all the unused Network ACLs.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration "Unused Network ACLs Should Be Removed" in AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the "Unused Network ACLs Should Be Removed" misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to list all the Network ACLs in your AWS account:
```
aws ec2 describe-network-acls
```

2. Identify the unused Network ACLs that you want to remove.

3. Before removing the Network ACLs, verify that they are not associated with any subnet. To do this, run the following command for each Network ACL, replacing "acl-xxxxxxxx" with the ID of the Network ACL:
```
aws ec2 describe-network-acls --network-acl-ids acl-xxxxxxxx
```
If the Network ACL is associated with a subnet, you will see the subnet ID under the "Associations" section. If the Network ACL is not associated with any subnet, you will see an empty list.

4. Once you have identified the unused Network ACLs, run the following command to delete them, replacing "acl-xxxxxxxx" with the ID of the Network ACL:
```
aws ec2 delete-network-acl --network-acl-id acl-xxxxxxxx
```

5. Verify that the Network ACLs have been deleted by running the following command again:
```
aws ec2 describe-network-acls
```
The unused Network ACLs should no longer appear in the list.

Note: Before deleting any Network ACLs, make sure that they are not being used by any other resources in your AWS account.

#### Using Python

To remediate "Unused Network ACLs Should Be Removed" misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to get the list of all the Network ACLs in your AWS account using the boto3 library in Python.

```python
import boto3

# Create a session with your AWS account
session = boto3.Session(region_name='us-east-1')

# Create a client for EC2 service
ec2 = session.client('ec2')

# Get all the Network ACLs in your AWS account
network_acls = ec2.describe_network_acls()
```

2. Next, you need to check if any of the Network ACLs are not associated with any subnets. You can do this by checking the `Associations` key in the Network ACLs response.

```python
# Check if any of the Network ACLs are not associated with any subnets
unused_network_acls = []

for network_acl in network_acls['NetworkAcls']:
    if not network_acl['Associations']:
        unused_network_acls.append(network_acl['NetworkAclId'])
```

3. Finally, you can delete the unused Network ACLs using the `delete_network_acl()` method in the boto3 library.

```python
# Delete the unused Network ACLs
for network_acl_id in unused_network_acls:
    ec2.delete_network_acl(NetworkAclId=network_acl_id)
    print(f"Deleted Network ACL: {network_acl_id}")
```

Note: Before deleting any Network ACLs, make sure that they are not being used by any other resources in your AWS account.
