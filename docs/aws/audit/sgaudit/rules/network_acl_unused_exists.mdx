How to remove unused NACL?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon VPC service.
2. From the left navigation pane, click on "Your VPCs" to view the list of VPCs.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Unused Network ACLs Should Be Removed" Policy.)
3. Select the VPC that contains the Network ACLs you want to remove by clicking on its name.
4. In the VPC details page, click on the "Network ACLs" tab.
5. Review the list of Network ACLs and identify the ones that are unused and no longer needed.
6. Before deleting a Network ACL, ensure that it is not associated with any subnets. If it is associated, you will need to disassociate it from the subnets before deletion.
7. To disassociate a Network ACL from a subnet, select the subnet in the "Subnets" tab and click on the "Actions" button. Choose "Edit subnet associations."
8. In the "Edit subnet associations" dialog box, uncheck the checkbox next to the Network ACL you want to disassociate and click on the "Save" button.
9. Once the Network ACL is disassociated from all subnets, select the Network ACL in the "Network ACLs" tab and click on the "Actions" button.
10. Choose "Delete Network ACL" from the dropdown menu and confirm the deletion when prompted.
11. Repeat the steps for each unused Network ACL that you want to remove.
