### More Info:

RDS instances should not be launched into the public cloud. Unless there is a specific business requirement, RDS instances should not have a public endpoint and should be accessed from within a VPC only.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate this misconfiguration in AWS:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the Amazon RDS console.
3. Choose the RDS instance that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Modify" button in the "Instance actions" dropdown menu.
5. Scroll down to the "Network & Security" section.
6. Under "Additional connectivity configuration", select "No" for the "Publicly accessible" option.
7. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Modify DB instance" button to save your changes.
8. Wait for the RDS instance to finish modifying. This process may take a few minutes.
9. Once the modification is complete, verify that the RDS instance is no longer publicly accessible by attempting to connect to it from a public IP address.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of having RDS instances publicly accessible in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Instances Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to list all the RDS instances in your AWS account:

```
aws rds describe-db-instances
```

Step 2: Identify the RDS instance which is publicly accessible.

Step 3: Run the following command to modify the RDS instance to remove the public accessibility:

```
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <instance_name> --no-publicly-accessible
```

Replace `<instance_name>` with the name of the RDS instance that you identified in Step 2.

Step 4: Verify that the public accessibility has been removed by running the following command:

```
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <instance_name> | grep PubliclyAccessible
```

This command should return "PubliclyAccessible: false" which confirms that the RDS instance is no longer publicly accessible.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Instances Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of RDS Instances being publicly accessible in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create an AWS client for RDS:

```python
rds = boto3.client('rds')
```

3. Get a list of all RDS instances:

```python
response = rds.describe_db_instances()
```

4. Loop through the instances and check if they are publicly accessible:

```python
for db_instance in response['DBInstances']:
    db_instance_id = db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']
    is_public = db_instance['PubliclyAccessible']
    if is_public:
        print(f"{db_instance_id} is publicly accessible.")
```

5. If an instance is publicly accessible, modify its settings to disable public accessibility:

```python
rds.modify_db_instance(
    DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance_id,
    PubliclyAccessible=False
)
```

6. Verify that the instance is no longer publicly accessible:

```python
response = rds.describe_db_instances(DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance_id)
is_public = response['DBInstances'][0]['PubliclyAccessible']
if not is_public:
    print(f"{db_instance_id} is no longer publicly accessible.")
```

7. Repeat steps 4-6 for all instances that are publicly accessible.

Note: Before making any changes to your RDS instances, it is recommended to take a backup and test the changes in a non-production environment.
