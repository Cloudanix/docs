### Remediation

How to remediate if RDS instances are public

#### Using AWS Console

If you have identified that your Amazon RDS instances are publicly accessible, you can remediate the issue by following these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon RDS service.

2. Select the RDS instance that is publicly accessible.

3. In the instance details page, click on the "Modify" button.

4. In the "Network & Security" section, locate the "Publicly Accessible" setting and uncheck the box to disable public access.

5. Review the other configuration settings and make any necessary changes.

6. Click on the "Apply Immediately" checkbox to apply the changes immediately, or choose a maintenance window for the changes to take effect.

7. Click on the "Modify DB Instance" button to save the changes.

Once the modification is complete, your RDS instance will no longer be publicly accessible. It will only be accessible from within your VPC or through authorized connections.

It is recommended to regularly review and monitor the accessibility settings of your RDS instances to ensure that they align with your security requirements and best practices.
