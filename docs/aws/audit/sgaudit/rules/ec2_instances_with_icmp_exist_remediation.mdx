### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of an EC2 Instance having open ICMP ports in AWS, follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Select the EC2 instance that has open ICMP ports.
4. Click on the "Security" tab.
5. Scroll down to the "Security Groups" section.
6. Click on the Security Group that is associated with the instance.
7. Click on the "Inbound Rules" tab.
8. Locate the rule that allows ICMP traffic.
9. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Edit inbound rules".
10. Select the rule that allows ICMP traffic.
11. Click on the "Remove" button.
12. Click on the "Save rules" button.

After completing these steps, the security group associated with the EC2 instance will no longer allow ICMP traffic.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of an EC2 instance having open ICMP ports in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Login to your AWS account and open the AWS CLI console.
2. Run the following command to get the security group ID of the EC2 instance:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId]' --output text
```

3. Run the following command to revoke the inbound rule for ICMP traffic:

```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol icmp --port all --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

Note: Replace `<security-group-id>` with the actual security group ID obtained in step 2.

4. Verify that the inbound rule for ICMP traffic has been revoked by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>
```

Note: Replace `<security-group-id>` with the actual security group ID obtained in step 2.

5. The output of the above command should not contain any inbound rule for ICMP traffic.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of an EC2 instance having open ICMP ports in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of EC2 instance having open ICMP ports in AWS using python, we can use the boto3 library which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here are the steps to remediate the issue:

1. Import the boto3 library and create an EC2 client object:

```
import boto3
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

2. Get a list of all the security groups associated with the EC2 instance:

```
response = ec2.describe_instances(
    Filters=[
        {
            'Name': 'instance-id',
            'Values': [
                'your-instance-id',
            ]
        },
    ]
)

security_groups = response['Reservations'][0]['Instances'][0]['SecurityGroups']
```

Note: Replace 'your-instance-id' with the actual ID of the EC2 instance that has the open ICMP ports.

3. For each security group, check if it has any inbound rules allowing ICMP traffic:

```
for sg in security_groups:
    response = ec2.describe_security_groups(
        GroupIds=[
            sg['GroupId'],
        ]
    )

    ip_permissions = response['SecurityGroups'][0]['IpPermissions']

    for permission in ip_permissions:
        if permission['IpProtocol'] == 'icmp':
            ec2.revoke_security_group_ingress(
                GroupId=sg['GroupId'],
                IpPermissions=[
                    {
                        'IpProtocol': 'icmp',
                        'IpRanges': [
                            {
                                'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'
                            },
                        ],
                        'Ipv6Ranges': [
                            {
                                'CidrIpv6': '::/0'
                            },
                        ],
                    },
                ]
            )
```

Note: This code will revoke all inbound ICMP rules for all IP ranges and IPv6 ranges. If you want to keep some of the rules, you can modify the code accordingly.

4. Run the script and verify that the open ICMP ports have been closed for the EC2 instance.

Note: Make sure that you have the necessary permissions to modify the security groups.
