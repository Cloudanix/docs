title: Default Security Groups Should Block All Traffic
sidebar_label: Default Security Groups Should Block All Traffic

### More Info:

Default security groups should block all traffic by default. EC2 instances should not be associated with default security groups.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

NIST

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of default security groups allowing all traffic in AWS, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Click on the "Security Groups" option in the left-hand menu.
4. Select the default security group.
5. Click on the "Edit" button at the bottom of the page.
6. In the "Inbound Rules" tab, delete any rules that allow all traffic (i.e. "All traffic" or "0.0.0.0/0").
7. Add specific rules to allow only the necessary traffic, such as SSH, HTTP, or HTTPS.
8. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

Note: It is recommended to create a new security group instead of modifying the default security group. This is because the default security group is applied to all instances launched in the same VPC, and any changes made to it can affect other resources.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Default Security Groups Should Block All Traffic" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to retrieve the ID of the default security group in the default VPC:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=default Name=group-name,Values=default
```

3. Note the security group ID returned in the output.

4. Run the following command to revoke all inbound rules from the default security group:

```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol all --port all --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

5. Run the following command to revoke all outbound rules from the default security group:

```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-egress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol all --port all --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

6. Run the following command to verify that all inbound and outbound rules have been removed from the default security group:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>
```

7. Verify that there are no inbound or outbound rules listed for the default security group.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Default Security Groups Should Block All Traffic" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Default Security Groups Should Block All Traffic" in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Create a new security group that will be used as the default security group for all instances.

```
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.create_security_group(GroupName='Default-SG', Description='Default Security Group')

security_group_id = response['GroupId']

print('Security Group Created %s in vpc %s.' % (security_group_id, vpc_id))
```

Step 2: Revoke all inbound and outbound rules from the default security group.

```
ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

security_group = ec2.SecurityGroup(security_group_id)

security_group.revoke_ingress(IpPermissions=security_group.ip_permissions)
security_group.revoke_egress(IpPermissions=security_group.ip_permissions_egress)
```

Step 3: Add a rule that denies all inbound and outbound traffic to the default security group.

```
security_group.authorize_ingress(
    GroupId=security_group_id,
    IpPermissions=[
        {
            'IpProtocol': '-1',
            'IpRanges': [{'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'}],
            'UserIdGroupPairs': []
        }
    ]
)

security_group.authorize_egress(
    GroupId=security_group_id,
    IpPermissions=[
        {
            'IpProtocol': '-1',
            'IpRanges': [{'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'}],
            'UserIdGroupPairs': []
        }
    ]
)
```

Step 4: Set the new security group as the default security group for all instances.

```
ec2.modify_instance_attribute(InstanceId=instance_id, Groups=[security_group_id])
```

Once the above steps are executed, all new instances will be launched with the new default security group that blocks all traffic. You can also modify the default security group of existing instances to use the new security group.
