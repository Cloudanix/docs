2. From the left navigation pane, click on "Your VPCs" to view the list of VPCs.
3. Select the VPC that contains the subnet for which you want to enable flow logs by clicking on its name.
4. In the VPC details page, click on the "Subnets" tab to view the list of subnets within the VPC.

8. In the "Create Flow Log" wizard, specify the following details:
   - Choose a unique name for the flow log.
   - Select the appropriate IAM role from the "IAM Role" dropdown menu. If you don't have an existing IAM role, you can create one by clicking on the "Create new IAM Role" button.
   - Select the appropriate traffic type for the flow logs. You can choose "All" to capture all traffic or select "Accept" or "Reject" to capture only accepted or rejected traffic.
   - Choose the log destination. You can either select an existing Amazon CloudWatch Logs group or create a new one.
