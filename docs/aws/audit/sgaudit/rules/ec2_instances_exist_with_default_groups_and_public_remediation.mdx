### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the "Default Security Group Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" misconfiguration for AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to your AWS console and go to the EC2 dashboard.

2. From the left-hand menu, click on "Security Groups".

3. In the Security Groups page, locate the "default" security group and select it.

4. In the "Inbound Rules" tab, remove any rules that allow traffic from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) or from any source.

5. If you need to allow traffic to specific ports, add new inbound rules that allow traffic only from specific IP addresses or CIDR blocks.

6. In the "Outbound Rules" tab, remove any rules that allow traffic to any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) or to any destination.

7. If you need to allow outbound traffic to specific destinations, add new outbound rules that allow traffic only to specific IP addresses or CIDR blocks.

8. Once you have made the necessary changes, click on the "Save" button to save the updated security group configuration.

9. Verify that the "default" security group is no longer publicly accessible by checking that there are no inbound or outbound rules that allow traffic from any IP address or to any destination.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the "Default Security Group Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" misconfiguration for AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of the default security group being publicly accessible in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to get the ID of the default security group:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=group-name,Values=default --query "SecurityGroups[*].GroupId" --output text
   ```

3. Run the following command to revoke the ingress rule that allows all traffic from all sources:

   ```
   aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol all --port all --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
   ```

   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the default security group that you obtained in step 2.

4. Run the following command to revoke the ingress rule that allows all traffic from all IPv6 sources:

   ```
   aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol all --port all --cidr ::/0
   ```

   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the default security group that you obtained in step 2.

5. Verify that the ingress rules have been revoked by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>
   ```

   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the default security group that you obtained in step 2.

6. Once you have verified that the ingress rules have been revoked, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of the default security group being publicly accessible.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Default Security Group Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" for AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to identify the default security group in your AWS account. You can use the boto3 library in Python to achieve this. Here's the code snippet to get the default security group:

```
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
response = ec2.describe_security_groups(Filters=[{'Name': 'group-name', 'Values': ['default']}])
sg_id = response['SecurityGroups'][0]['GroupId']
```

2. Once you have the default security group ID, you can update its inbound rules to ensure that it is not publicly accessible. Here's the code snippet to update the security group:

```
ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
security_group = ec2.SecurityGroup(sg_id)

# Revoke all inbound rules
security_group.revoke_ingress(
    IpPermissions=security_group.ip_permissions
)

# Allow traffic from within the VPC
security_group.authorize_ingress(
    IpPermissions=[
        {
            'IpProtocol': '-1',
            'UserIdGroupPairs': [
                {
                    'GroupId': sg_id
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
```

3. The above code snippet revokes all the inbound rules of the default security group and allows traffic only from within the VPC. This ensures that the default security group is not publicly accessible.

4. You can run this Python script periodically to ensure that the default security group remains secure and not publicly accessible.

Note: Before running the above script, make sure that you have the necessary permissions to modify the security group. Also, make sure that you test this script in a non-production environment before running it in production.
