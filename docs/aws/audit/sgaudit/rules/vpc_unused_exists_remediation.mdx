### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the VPC Dashboard by selecting "VPC" under the "Networking & Content Delivery" section.
3. In the VPC Dashboard, select "Virtual Private Gateways" from the left-hand side menu.
4. Here, you can see all the Virtual Private Gateways associated with your account. Check the "State" column for each gateway. If the state is "detached", it means the Virtual Private Gateway is unused and should be removed.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the Virtual Private Gateways (VPGs) in your AWS account using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-vpn-gateways
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with details about all the VPGs in your account.

3. To find out if a VPG is attached to a VPC or not, you can check the 'VpcAttachments' field in the output. If the 'State' field under 'VpcAttachments' is 'detached', it means the VPG is not attached to any VPC.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-vpn-gateways --query 'VpnGateways[?VpcAttachments[?State==`detached`]].{ID:VpnGatewayId,State:State}'
   ```

4. If you want to automate this process, you can write a Python script using the Boto3 library (AWS SDK for Python) to list all the VPGs and check their attachment status. Here is a simple script to do that:

   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   response = ec2.describe_vpn_gateways()

   for gateway in response['VpnGateways']:
       for attachment in gateway['VpcAttachments']:
           if attachment['State'] == 'detached':
               print(f"VPG {gateway['VpnGatewayId']} is not attached to any VPC.")
   ```
   
   This script will print the IDs of all the VPGs that are not attached to any VPC.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install and configure Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python. This allows you to directly create, update, and delete AWS resources from your Python scripts.

   You can install Boto3 using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

   Then, configure your AWS credentials:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```

2. Create a Python script to list all Virtual Private Gateways:
   You can use the `describe_vpn_gateways` method provided by Boto3 to list all Virtual Private Gateways in your AWS account.

   Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_vpn_gateways():
       client = boto3.client('ec2')
       response = client.describe_vpn_gateways()
       return response['VpnGateways']

   print(list_vpn_gateways())
   ```

3. Check if the Virtual Private Gateways are in use:
   For each Virtual Private Gateway, you can check if it is attached to a VPC by checking the `VpcAttachments` field in the response. If this field is empty, the Virtual Private Gateway is not in use.

   Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_unused_vpn_gateways():
       client = boto3.client('ec2')
       response = client.describe_vpn_gateways()
       unused_gateways = [gateway for gateway in response['VpnGateways'] if not gateway['VpcAttachments']]
       return unused_gateways

   print(list_unused_vpn_gateways())
   ```

4. Schedule the script to run periodically:
   You can schedule your script to run periodically using a cron job or a task scheduler. This allows you to continuously monitor your AWS account for unused Virtual Private Gateways and take action when they are detected.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of Unused Virtual Private Gateways in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Navigate to the AWS Management Console at https://aws.amazon.com/ and login with your credentials.

2. **Access VPC Dashboard**: Go to the VPC dashboard by selecting the "Services" dropdown menu at the top left corner, then selecting "VPC" under the Networking & Content Delivery section.

3. **Identify Unused Virtual Private Gateways**:
   - In the VPC dashboard, click on "Virtual Private Gateways" on the left-hand side menu.
   - Review the list of Virtual Private Gateways to identify any that are not associated with any VPCs or are no longer in use.

4. **Dissociate and Delete Unused Virtual Private Gateways**:
   - Select the unused Virtual Private Gateway that you want to remove.
   - Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and choose "Detach from VPC" to dissociate the Virtual Private Gateway from the VPC.
   - Once detached, select the Virtual Private Gateway again and click on the "Actions" dropdown menu, then choose "Delete Virtual Private Gateway" to remove it completely.

5. **Confirm Deletion**:
   - A confirmation dialog will appear asking you to confirm the deletion of the Virtual Private Gateway. Confirm the action to proceed with the deletion.

6. **Verify Removal**:
   - After deleting the Virtual Private Gateway, verify that it has been successfully removed from the list of Virtual Private Gateways in the VPC dashboard.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of Unused Virtual Private Gateways in AWS by identifying and removing any Virtual Private Gateways that are no longer in use.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of unused Virtual Private Gateways in AWS, you can follow the steps below using AWS CLI:

1. List all the Virtual Private Gateways in your AWS account:
```
aws ec2 describe-vpn-gateways --query 'VpnGateways[?State == `available`].{ID:VpnGatewayId}'
```

2. Identify the Virtual Private Gateways that are not associated with any VPC. These are the ones that are unused.

3. To detach the Virtual Private Gateway from a VPC, you can use the following command:
```
aws ec2 detach-vpn-gateway --vpn-gateway-id <vpn-gateway-id> --vpc-id <vpc-id>
```

4. Once you have detached the Virtual Private Gateway from all VPCs, you can delete the Virtual Private Gateway using the following command:
```
aws ec2 delete-vpn-gateway --vpn-gateway-id <vpn-gateway-id>
```

5. Confirm that the Virtual Private Gateway has been deleted by listing all the Virtual Private Gateways again:
```
aws ec2 describe-vpn-gateways --query 'VpnGateways[?State == `available`].{ID:VpnGatewayId}'
```

By following these steps, you can identify and remove any unused Virtual Private Gateways in your AWS account using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of unused Virtual Private Gateways in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Use Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python, to list all the Virtual Private Gateways in your AWS account.
2. Use Boto3 to list all the VPCs in your AWS account.
3. Compare the Virtual Private Gateways with the VPCs to identify any unused Virtual Private Gateways.
4. If any Virtual Private Gateways are found to be unused, delete them using Boto3.

Here is a sample Python script to achieve this:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the Boto3 client
ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

# List all Virtual Private Gateways
response = ec2_client.describe_vpn_gateways()

# List all VPCs
vpcs = ec2_client.describe_vpcs()

# Extract the VPC IDs from the VPCs response
vpc_ids = [vpc['VpcId'] for vpc in vpcs['Vpcs']]

# Identify the Virtual Private Gateways that are not associated with any VPC
unused_vpn_gateways = [vpn_gateway['VpnGatewayId'] for vpn_gateway in response['VpnGateways'] if 'VpcAttachments' not in vpn_gateway or len(vpn_gateway['VpcAttachments']) == 0]

# Delete the unused Virtual Private Gateways
for vpn_gateway_id in unused_vpn_gateways:
    ec2_client.delete_vpn_gateway(VpnGatewayId=vpn_gateway_id)
    print(f"Deleted Virtual Private Gateway: {vpn_gateway_id}")
```

Make sure you have the necessary permissions in your AWS IAM role to delete Virtual Private Gateways before running this script. Also, ensure you have installed the Boto3 library (`pip install boto3`) and configured your AWS credentials.
