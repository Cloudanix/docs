### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the unused Virtual Private Gateways issue in AWS:

1. Login to your AWS console.
2. Go to the VPC dashboard.
3. Click on "Virtual Private Gateways" from the left-hand menu.
4. Identify the Virtual Private Gateway that is not in use.
5. Select the Virtual Private Gateway that you want to delete.
6. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Delete Virtual Private Gateway" from the drop-down menu.
7. A warning message will appear, click on "Yes, Delete" to confirm the deletion of the Virtual Private Gateway.

After following the above steps, the unused Virtual Private Gateway will be deleted, and the issue will be remediated.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Unused Virtual Private Gateways Should Be Removed" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Login to your AWS account using AWS CLI.
2. Run the following command to list all the Virtual Private Gateways (VPGs) in your AWS account.

```
aws ec2 describe-vpn-gateways
```

3. Identify the Virtual Private Gateways that are not in use and need to be removed.

4. Run the following command to delete the identified Virtual Private Gateway.

```
aws ec2 delete-vpn-gateway --vpn-gateway-id <vpn-gateway-id>
```

Replace `<vpn-gateway-id>` with the ID of the Virtual Private Gateway that needs to be removed.

5. Confirm the deletion by running the following command.

```
aws ec2 describe-vpn-gateways --vpn-gateway-ids <vpn-gateway-id>
```

This command should return an error message stating that the Virtual Private Gateway does not exist.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for all the unused Virtual Private Gateways that need to be removed.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Unused Virtual Private Gateways Should Be Removed" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Unused Virtual Private Gateways in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Import the necessary AWS SDKs and libraries in your Python script.

```python
import boto3
```

Step 2: Create an AWS session using the `boto3.Session()` method.

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='REGION'
)
```

Step 3: Create an EC2 client using the `session.client()` method.

```python
ec2_client = session.client('ec2')
```

Step 4: Use the `describe_vpn_gateways()` method to get the list of all Virtual Private Gateways.

```python
response = ec2_client.describe_vpn_gateways()
vpn_gateways = response['VpnGateways']
```

Step 5: Loop through the list of Virtual Private Gateways and check if they are in use or not.

```python
for vpn_gateway in vpn_gateways:
    attachments = vpn_gateway['VpcAttachments']
    if not attachments:
        print(f"Unused VPN Gateway found: {vpn_gateway['VpnGatewayId']}")
        # Perform the remediation action here
```

Step 6: If a Virtual Private Gateway is not attached to any VPC, then it is not in use. You can perform the remediation action here, which is to delete the unused Virtual Private Gateway using the `delete_vpn_gateway()` method.

```python
ec2_client.delete_vpn_gateway(VpnGatewayId=vpn_gateway['VpnGatewayId'])
print(f"Deleted VPN Gateway: {vpn_gateway['VpnGatewayId']}")
```

Step 7: Run the Python script to remediate the misconfiguration of Unused Virtual Private Gateways in AWS.

Note: Make sure to test the script in a non-production environment before running it in a production environment.
