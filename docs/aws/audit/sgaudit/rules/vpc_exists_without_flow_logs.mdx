How to enable flow logs for VPC

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon VPC service.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Flow Logs on VPC Should Be Enabled" Policy.)
2. From the left navigation pane, click on "Your VPCs" to view the list of VPCs.
3. Select the VPC for which you want to enable flow logs by clicking on its name.
4. In the VPC details page, click on the "Flow Logs" tab.
5. Click on the "Create Flow Log" button.
6. In the "Create Flow Log" wizard, specify the following details:
   - Choose a unique name for the flow log.
   - Select the appropriate IAM role from the "IAM Role" dropdown menu. If you don't have an existing IAM role, you can create one by clicking on the "Create new IAM Role" button.
   - Select the appropriate traffic type for the flow logs. You can choose "All" to capture all traffic or select "Accept" or "Reject" to capture only accepted or rejected traffic.
   - Choose the log destination. You can either select an existing Amazon CloudWatch Logs group or create a new one.
   - Optionally, choose the format for the flow log records. The default is "AWS VPC Flow Log format," but you can also select "Custom format" if required.
7. Click on the "Create" button to create the flow log for the selected VPC.
8. Once the flow log is created, you can view its status and details in the "Flow Logs" tab of the VPC details page.
9. To view the flow log data, navigate to the Amazon CloudWatch Logs service. From there, you can search and analyze the flow log records.
