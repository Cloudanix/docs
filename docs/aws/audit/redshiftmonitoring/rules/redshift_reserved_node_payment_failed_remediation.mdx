### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Redshift Reserved Nodes Should Not Have Status - Payment Failed" in AWS using AWS console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Amazon Redshift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Reserved Nodes".
3. In the Reserved Nodes page, select the reserved node that has a status of "Payment Failed".
4. Choose "Modify Reserved Node".
5. In the Modify Reserved Node dialog box, modify the node by selecting a new node type, term, or number of nodes.
6. Choose "Purchase Reserved Node" to complete the purchase process.

After completing the above steps, the reserved node will be available for use and the status will be updated to "Active".

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Redshift Reserved Nodes having status "Payment Failed" in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Identify the Reserved Node with Payment Failed status using the below AWS CLI command:

```
aws redshift describe-reserved-nodes --query 'ReservedNodes[?State==`payment-failed`]'
```

Step 2: Once you have identified the Reserved Node with Payment Failed status, you can modify the Reserved Node using the below AWS CLI command:

```
aws redshift modify-reserved-nodes --reserved-node-id <reserved-node-id> --target-availability-zone <target-availability-zone>
```

Replace `<reserved-node-id>` with the ID of the Reserved Node with Payment Failed status and `<target-availability-zone>` with the availability zone where you want to launch the Reserved Node.

Step 3: After modifying the Reserved Node, you can verify the status of the Reserved Node using the below AWS CLI command:

```
aws redshift describe-reserved-nodes --reserved-node-id <reserved-node-id> --query 'ReservedNodes[*].{ID:ReservedNodeId,State:State}'
```

Replace `<reserved-node-id>` with the ID of the Reserved Node you modified. The status of the Reserved Node should now be "active". 

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Redshift Reserved Nodes having status "Payment Failed" in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Redshift Reserved Nodes Should Not Have Status - Payment Failed" for AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Use the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to list all the reserved nodes for Redshift.

```python
import boto3

redshift = boto3.client('redshift')

reserved_nodes = redshift.describe_reserved_nodes()
```

2. Filter the reserved nodes that have a status of "payment-failed".

```python
payment_failed_nodes = [node for node in reserved_nodes['ReservedNodes'] if node['State'] == 'payment-failed']
```

3. Cancel the payment failed nodes using the `modify_reserved_node` function.

```python
for node in payment_failed_nodes:
    redshift.modify_reserved_node(ReservedNodeId=node['ReservedNodeId'], NodeCount=node['NodeCount'], 
                                  NodeType=node['NodeType'], OfferingType=node['OfferingType'], 
                                  ActionType='cancel')
```

4. Verify that the reserved nodes have been cancelled by checking their status.

```python
reserved_nodes = redshift.describe_reserved_nodes()
cancelled_nodes = [node for node in reserved_nodes['ReservedNodes'] if node['State'] == 'cancelled']
```

5. Print a success message.

```python
print(f"{len(payment_failed_nodes)} payment-failed nodes have been cancelled.")
```

Note: Make sure you have the necessary AWS credentials and permissions to access and modify reserved nodes for Redshift.
