### Remediation

How to modify Amazon Redshift clusters configuration to disable public traffic so these can be privately accessible only from VPC?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Amazon Redshift service by selecting "Redshift" from the services menu.
3. In the Redshift dashboard, click on "Clusters" in the left navigation pane.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Redshift Cluster Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" Policy.)
4. Identify the Redshift cluster(s) that are publicly accessible.
5. Take note of the specific cluster identifier(s) that need remediation.
6. Select the checkbox next to the cluster(s) you want to remediate.
7. Above the list of clusters, click on the "Modify" button.
8. In the "Modify cluster" page, locate the "Publicly accessible" setting.
9. Set the "Publicly accessible" option to "No" to restrict public access to the cluster.
10. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Modify cluster" button to apply the changes.
11. The modification process may take a few minutes to complete.
12. Monitor the modification progress in the Redshift dashboard. Once the modification is complete, the cluster will no longer be publicly accessible.
13. Validate the accessibility of the cluster by verifying that it can only be accessed through the desired private networks or authorized endpoints.
14. Repeat these steps for each Redshift cluster that is publicly accessible until all clusters have been remediated.
