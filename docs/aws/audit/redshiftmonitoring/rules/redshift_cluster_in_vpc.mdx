How to launch Redshift cluster within a VPC?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Create a VPC: If you don't have a VPC already, you need to create one. You can do this through the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI/APIs.
2. Set up subnets: Within the VPC, create or identify the subnets where you want to launch the Redshift cluster. Ensure that the subnets are associated with the VPC, have the appropriate network configurations, and are accessible from your desired network environment.
3. Configure security groups: Create or select the security groups that define the inbound and outbound traffic rules for your Redshift cluster. Configure the security groups to allow necessary access to the Redshift cluster from your desired network resources.
4. Launch the Redshift cluster: In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the Amazon Redshift service and click on "Create Cluster". Provide the necessary details such as cluster identifier, node type, number of nodes, database credentials, etc.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Redshift Clusters Should Be Launched Within a VPC" Policy.)
5. Configure the VPC settings: In the cluster configuration, choose the VPC and subnets where you want to launch the cluster. Select the appropriate security groups for inbound and outbound traffic.
6. Adjust other settings: Customize other cluster settings as needed, including encryption, backup retention, maintenance window, etc.
7. Review and launch: Review the configuration details and click on "Launch Cluster" to initiate the creation of the Redshift cluster within the specified VPC.
