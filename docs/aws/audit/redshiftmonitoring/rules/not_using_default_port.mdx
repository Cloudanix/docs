### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the Redshift cluster default port misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to your AWS account and navigate to the Amazon Redshift console.

2. Select the Redshift cluster for which you want to remediate the default port misconfiguration.

3. Click on the "Properties" tab in the cluster details page.

4. In the "Network and security" section, click on the "Edit" button.

5. In the "Cluster security group" section, click on the "Add Rule" button.

6. Select "Custom TCP Rule" from the dropdown menu.

7. In the "Port range" field, enter the non-default port number that you want to use for your Redshift cluster.

8. In the "Source" field, enter the IP address or IP range that you want to allow access to the cluster.

9. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

10. Repeat steps 5-9 for all the security groups associated with the Redshift cluster.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the Redshift cluster default port misconfiguration and secure your cluster by using a non-default port number.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.
2. Run the following command to list all the Redshift clusters in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws redshift describe-clusters
   ```

3. Identify the Redshift cluster that is using the default port (port 5439).
4. Run the following command to modify the cluster's properties:

   ```
   aws redshift modify-cluster --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --port <new-port>
   ```

   Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the identifier of the Redshift cluster that you want to modify, and `<new-port>` with the new port number that you want to use.

5. Verify that the cluster's properties have been updated by running the following command:

   ```
   aws redshift describe-clusters --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier>
   ```

   This command should return the updated configuration details for the specified cluster.

6. Repeat the above steps for all the Redshift clusters in your AWS account that are using the default port.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Redshift clusters using the default port in your AWS account. It is recommended to use a non-default port to enhance the security of your Redshift clusters.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Redshift cluster default port misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to identify the Redshift clusters that are using the default port. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all the Redshift clusters in your AWS account and check their port configuration.

```python
import boto3

# Create a Redshift client
client = boto3.client('redshift')

# List all Redshift clusters
response = client.describe_clusters()

# Check the port configuration for each cluster
for cluster in response['Clusters']:
    if cluster['Endpoint']['Port'] == 5439:
        print(f"{cluster['ClusterIdentifier']} is using the default port.")
```

2. Once you have identified the Redshift clusters that are using the default port, you can update their port configuration using the `modify_cluster` method of the Redshift client.

```python
import boto3

# Create a Redshift client
client = boto3.client('redshift')

# Modify the port configuration for a cluster
response = client.modify_cluster(
    ClusterIdentifier='my-redshift-cluster',
    ClusterParameterGroupName='default.redshift-1.0',
    ApplyImmediately=True,
    Parameters=[
        {
            'ParameterName': 'listener_port',
            'ParameterValue': '1234',
            'ApplyType': 'static'
        },
    ]
)
```

In the above example, we are modifying the port configuration for a Redshift cluster named `my-redshift-cluster` and setting its port to `1234`. You can modify the code to update the port configuration for all the Redshift clusters that are using the default port.

3. Finally, you can verify that the port configuration has been updated for the Redshift clusters by checking their endpoint details using the `describe_clusters` method.

```python
import boto3

# Create a Redshift client
client = boto3.client('redshift')

# List all Redshift clusters
response = client.describe_clusters()

# Check the port configuration for each cluster
for cluster in response['Clusters']:
    print(f"{cluster['ClusterIdentifier']} endpoint: {cluster['Endpoint']['Address']}:{cluster['Endpoint']['Port']}")
```

In the above example, we are printing the endpoint details for all the Redshift clusters in the AWS account, including their updated port configuration.
