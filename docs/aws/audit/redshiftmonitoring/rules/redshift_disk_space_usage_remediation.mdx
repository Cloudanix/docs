### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the high disk usage issue for AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) dashboard.
3. Select the EKS cluster that has high disk usage.
4. Click on the "Nodes" tab to view the list of nodes in the cluster.
5. Identify the node with high disk usage and click on its name.
6. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Edit".
7. In the "Edit Node Group" page, scroll down to the "Scaling" section.
8. Increase the desired number of nodes to scale up the cluster.
9. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

Once the scaling process completes, the high disk usage issue should be remediated. You can monitor the disk usage of the nodes in the cluster to ensure that the issue does not recur.

#### Using CLI

To remediate high disk usage in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the cluster with high disk usage:
   - Use the following command to list all the clusters in your account:
     ```
     aws ecs list-clusters
     ```
   - Use the following command to describe the clusters and get information about their disk usage:
     ```
     aws ecs describe-clusters --clusters <cluster-name>
     ```
     Replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of the cluster you want to check.

2. Scale the cluster:
   - Use the following command to update the service associated with the cluster and increase the number of tasks:
     ```
     aws ecs update-service --cluster <cluster-name> --service <service-name> --desired-count <new-task-count>
     ```
     Replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of the cluster, `<service-name>` with the name of the service associated with the cluster, and `<new-task-count>` with the desired number of tasks.

3. Verify the disk usage:
   - Use the following command to describe the cluster and verify that the disk usage has decreased:
     ```
     aws ecs describe-clusters --clusters <cluster-name>
     ```
     Replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of the cluster you scaled.

Note: Scaling the cluster will increase the number of tasks and distribute the workload, which should reduce the disk usage. However, if the high disk usage is due to data that needs to be retained, you may need to consider other solutions such as increasing the disk space or archiving the data.

#### Using Python

To remediate high disk usage on AWS clusters using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to identify the clusters with high disk usage. You can use the AWS CloudWatch service to monitor disk usage metrics for your clusters. Specifically, you can use the "VolumeReadBytes" and "VolumeWriteBytes" metrics to determine the amount of data being read and written to the volumes attached to your instances.

2. Once you have identified the clusters with high disk usage, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to programmatically scale the cluster. Specifically, you can use the "modify_cluster" method of the Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) service to increase the number of nodes in the cluster.

3. To modify the cluster, you will need to create an instance group configuration with the desired number of nodes and instance type. You can use the "InstanceGroupConfig" class from the Boto3 library to create this configuration.

4. Once you have created the instance group configuration, you can pass it as a parameter to the "modify_cluster" method along with the ID of the cluster you want to modify.

Here is some sample Python code that demonstrates how to modify an EMR cluster to increase the number of nodes:

```
import boto3

# Create a client for the EMR service
emr = boto3.client('emr')

# Specify the ID of the cluster you want to modify
cluster_id = 'your-cluster-id'

# Create an instance group configuration with the desired number of nodes and instance type
instance_group_config = {
    'InstanceCount': 5,
    'InstanceType': 'm5.xlarge',
    'Name': 'core-instance-group',
    'InstanceRole': 'CORE'
}

# Modify the cluster with the new instance group configuration
emr.modify_instance_groups(
    ClusterId=cluster_id,
    InstanceGroups=[instance_group_config]
)
```

This code will modify the cluster with the ID "your-cluster-id" to increase the number of core nodes to 5, using the "m5.xlarge" instance type. You can adjust the parameters as needed to suit your specific requirements.
