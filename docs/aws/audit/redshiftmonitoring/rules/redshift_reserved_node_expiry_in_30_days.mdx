1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Redshift dashboard. From the navigation pane, choose "Clusters".
3. In the list of clusters, select the cluster for which you want to check the Redshift Reserved Node Lease Expiration.
4. In the details pane, under "Configuration", look for "Reserved Node details". Here, you can see the expiration date of the lease. If the expiration date is within the next 30 days, then it indicates that the Redshift Reserved Node Lease will expire soon.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "describe-reserved-nodes" command to get information about the reserved nodes in Amazon Redshift. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws redshift describe-reserved-nodes
   ```

3. This command will return a JSON output with details about all the reserved nodes. You need to look for the "StartTime" and "Duration" fields in the output. The "StartTime" field indicates when the reservation started, and the "Duration" field indicates the duration of the reservation in seconds.

4. To find out if a reserved node lease is expiring in the next 30 days, you need to write a script that calculates the difference between the current date and the start time plus the duration. If the difference is less than or equal to 30 days, then the lease is expiring in the next 30 days. Here is a simple Python script that does this:

   ```python
   import json
   import subprocess
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Run the AWS CLI command and get the output
   output = subprocess.check_output(["aws", "redshift", "describe-reserved-nodes"])
   data = json.loads(output)

   # Get the current date
   now = datetime.now()

   # Check each reserved node
   for node in data['ReservedNodes']:
       # Get the start time and duration
       start_time = datetime.strptime(node['StartTime'], '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')
       duration = timedelta(seconds=node['Duration'])

       # Calculate the expiration date
       expiration_date = start_time + duration

       # Check if the lease is expiring in the next 30 days
       if now <= expiration_date <= now + timedelta(days=30):
           print(f"Reserved node {node['ReservedNodeId']} is expiring in the next 30 days.")
   ```
   
Please note that this script assumes that the AWS CLI is configured with access to the necessary resources. If it's not, you may need to provide the necessary credentials or configure the AWS CLI accordingly.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) on your local system. Boto3 allows you to directly create, update, and delete AWS services from your Python scripts.

2. Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS using your access keys. 

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Create a session using your AWS credentials
aws_session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2' # or your preferred region
)
```

3. Use the `describe_reserved_nodes` method of the Redshift client to get a list of all reserved nodes. Then, iterate over the list and check the `EndTime` of each reserved node. If the `EndTime` is within the next 30 days, print the details of the node.

```python
# Create a Redshift client
redshift = aws_session.client('redshift')

# Get a list of all reserved nodes
response = redshift.describe_reserved_nodes()

# Get the current date and time
now = datetime.now()

# Iterate over the reserved nodes
for node in response['ReservedNodes']:
    # Get the end time of the reserved node
    end_time = node['EndTime']
    
    # Check if the end time is within the next 30 days
    if now <= end_time <= now + timedelta(days=30):
        print(f"Reserved node {node['ReservedNodeId']} will expire on {end_time}")
```

4. Run the script regularly (for example, as a daily cron job) to monitor your Redshift reserved nodes. If a node is due to expire within the next 30 days, the script will print a message with the node's ID and expiration date.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of Redshift Reserved Node Lease Expiration in the next 30 days using Python, you can automate the process by checking the expiration dates of the reserved nodes and renewing them if necessary. Below are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this issue:

Step 1: Install Boto3
Ensure that you have the Boto3 library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

Step 2: Write Python Script
Create a Python script that will retrieve the expiration dates of the Redshift reserved nodes and renew them if the expiration date is within the next 30 days. Below is a sample script to achieve this:

```python
import boto3
import datetime

# Initialize the Redshift client
client = boto3.client('redshift')

# Get a list of reserved nodes
response = client.describe_reserved_nodes()

# Get the current date
current_date = datetime.datetime.now()

# Check for reserved nodes with expiration date within the next 30 days
for node in response['ReservedNodes']:
    expiration_date = node['StartTime'].date() + datetime.timedelta(days=node['Duration'])
    days_until_expiration = (expiration_date - current_date.date()).days
    
    if days_until_expiration <= 30:
        # Renew the reserved node
        client.modify_reserved_node(
            ReservedNodeOfferingId=node['ReservedNodeOfferingId'],
            ReservedNodeId=node['ReservedNodeId'],
            NodeCount=node['NodeCount']
        )
        print(f"Reserved node {node['ReservedNodeId']} renewed successfully.")
```

Step 3: Run the Script
Save the Python script to a file (e.g., `remediate_redshift_reserved_nodes.py`) and run it using the Python interpreter. Make sure you have the necessary AWS credentials configured for the Boto3 client to authenticate with AWS.

```bash
python remediate_redshift_reserved_nodes.py
```

This script will automatically check the expiration dates of the Redshift reserved nodes and renew them if the expiration date is within the next 30 days.

Note: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to describe and modify reserved nodes in Redshift.
