1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Clusters". This will open a list of all your existing Redshift clusters.

3. Click on the name of the cluster you want to check. This will open the cluster details page.

4. In the "Configuration" tab, look for the "Nodes" section. Here, you can see the number of nodes currently in use for the selected cluster. Compare this number with the maximum limit for your account to determine if you are close to or exceeding the limit.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all Redshift clusters: Use the following command to list all the Redshift clusters in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws redshift describe-clusters
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the Redshift clusters.

3. Check the number of nodes in each cluster: In the JSON output from the previous step, look for the 'NumberOfNodes' field. This field indicates the number of nodes in the cluster. 

   ```
   aws redshift describe-clusters --query 'Clusters[*].[ClusterIdentifier,NumberOfNodes]'
   ```

   This command will return a list of all clusters along with their node count.

4. Compare the number of nodes with the limit: AWS has a default limit of 50 nodes per cluster for Redshift. If the 'NumberOfNodes' field in the output is close to or at this limit, then you are at the Redshift nodes limit.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): To interact with AWS services, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials to enable Boto3 to communicate with AWS services. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   AWS_SESSION_TOKEN = 'your_session_token' # optional
   ```

2. Use Boto3 to interact with AWS Redshift: Once Boto3 is installed and configured, you can use it to interact with AWS Redshift. Here is a sample Python script that lists all Redshift clusters and their nodes:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_redshift_clusters():
       redshift = boto3.client('redshift')
       response = redshift.describe_clusters()
       for cluster in response['Clusters']:
           print(f"Cluster: {cluster['ClusterIdentifier']}, Nodes: {cluster['NumberOfNodes']}")

   list_redshift_clusters()
   ```
   This script uses the `describe_clusters` method of the Redshift client to retrieve information about all Redshift clusters. It then prints the identifier and the number of nodes for each cluster.

3. Check the Redshift Nodes Limit: AWS has a default limit on the number of nodes that you can have in a Redshift cluster. You can check this limit by calling the `describe_account_attributes` method of the Redshift client:

   ```python
   def check_redshift_nodes_limit():
       redshift = boto3.client('redshift')
       response = redshift.describe_account_attributes()
       for attribute in response['AccountAttributes']:
           if attribute['AttributeName'] == 'ClusterLimit':
               print(f"Redshift Nodes Limit: {attribute['AttributeValues'][0]['AttributeValue']}")

   check_redshift_nodes_limit()
   ```
   This script retrieves the account attributes and checks the 'ClusterLimit' attribute, which represents the maximum number of nodes that you can have in a Redshift cluster.

4. Compare the current number of nodes with the limit: You can modify the `list_redshift_clusters` function to count the total number of nodes across all clusters. Then, you can compare this number with the limit to detect if you are close to reaching it:

   ```python
   def count_redshift_nodes():
       redshift = boto3.client('redshift')
       response = redshift.describe_clusters()
       total_nodes = sum(cluster['NumberOfNodes'] for cluster in response['Clusters'])
       print(f"Total Redshift Nodes: {total_nodes}")

   count_redshift_nodes()
   check_redshift_nodes_limit()
   ```
   This script first counts the total number of nodes and then checks the limit. If the total number of nodes is close to the limit, you may need to request an increase in the limit from AWS.

To remediate the Redshift Nodes Limit issue in AWS Redshift using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Boto3 library:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

2. Create a Python script with the following code to modify the Redshift cluster configuration:

```python
import boto3

# Define the AWS credentials and region
AWS_ACCESS_KEY = 'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY'
AWS_SECRET_KEY = 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY'
AWS_REGION = 'YOUR_AWS_REGION'

# Initialize the Redshift client
client = boto3.client('redshift', aws_access_key_id=AWS_ACCESS_KEY, aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET_KEY, region_name=AWS_REGION)

# Specify the Redshift cluster identifier
cluster_identifier = 'YOUR_REDSHIFT_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER'

# Specify the new number of nodes
new_node_count = 4  # Change this to the desired number of nodes

# Modify the Redshift cluster configuration
response = client.modify_cluster(
    ClusterIdentifier=cluster_identifier,
    NumberOfNodes=new_node_count,
    ApplyImmediately=True
)

print(response)
```

3. Replace the placeholders `YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY`, `YOUR_AWS_REGION`, `YOUR_REDSHIFT_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER`, and `new_node_count` with your actual AWS credentials, region, Redshift cluster identifier, and the desired number of nodes.

4. Run the Python script to modify the Redshift cluster configuration and increase the number of nodes to remediate the Redshift Nodes Limit issue.
