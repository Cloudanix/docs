### Remediation

#### Using Console
1. Go to the Amazon EMR console.
2. Navigate to "Clusters".
3. Select the EMR cluster that doesn't have encryption configured.
4. Click "Edit".
5. Scroll down to the "Security and access" section.
6. Under "Security configuration", select or create a security configuration that includes in-transit and at-rest encryption settings.
7. Click "Save changes".

#### Using CLI
You will need to create or update a security configuration that includes encryption settings and apply it to your EMR cluster.

```bash
# Step 1: Create a security configuration if you don't have one
aws emr create-security-configuration --name <security-config-name> --security-configuration <path-to-json-file>

# Step 2: Update your EMR cluster to use the security configuration
aws emr modify-cluster --cluster-id <cluster-id> --security-configuration <security-config-name>
```

Replace `<security-config-name>` with the name of your security configuration and `<path-to-json-file>` with the path to a JSON file containing the encryption settings. Replace `<cluster-id>` with the ID of your EMR cluster.

#### Using Python
You can use Boto3 to achieve this programmatically. First, you'll need to create or update a security configuration that includes encryption settings, and then apply it to your EMR cluster.

```python
import boto3
import json

def create_security_configuration(config_name, config_file_path):
    client = boto3.client('emr')
    with open(config_file_path, 'r') as config_file:
        config = json.load(config_file)
    response = client.create_security_configuration(
        Name=config_name,
        SecurityConfiguration=json.dumps(config)
    )
    print("Security configuration created:", response['Name'])
    return response['Name']

def update_emr_cluster_security_config(cluster_id, security_config_name):
    client = boto3.client('emr')
    response = client.modify_cluster(
        ClusterId=cluster_id,
        SecurityConfiguration=security_config_name
    )
    print("EMR cluster updated with security configuration:", response['ClusterId'])

def main():
    security_config_name = '<security-config-name>'
    config_file_path = '<path-to-json-file>'
    cluster_id = '<cluster-id>'
    
    # Step 1: Create or update security configuration
    create_security_configuration(security_config_name, config_file_path)
    
    # Step 2: Update EMR cluster with the security configuration
    update_emr_cluster_security_config(cluster_id, security_config_name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Replace `<security-config-name>` with the name of your security configuration, `<path-to-json-file>` with the path to a JSON file containing the encryption settings, and `<cluster-id>` with the ID of your EMR cluster.

In the JSON file, you need to specify the encryption settings for both in-transit and at-rest encryption.
