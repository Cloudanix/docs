2. Navigate to the Amazon Redshift service by selecting "Redshift" from the services menu.
3. In the Amazon Redshift dashboard, select the cluster you want to encrypt.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Redshift Clusters Should Be Encrypted With KMS CMKs" Policy.)
4. Click on the "Cluster" dropdown menu and select "Modify".
5. In the Modify Cluster page, scroll down to the "Encryption" section.
6. Select the option "Enabled" for encryption.
7. Under the "Encryption Key" dropdown menu, select "Customer managed CMK".

9. Review the other configuration settings as needed and click on the "Modify Cluster" button.
10. AWS will start the modification process to enable encryption for the Redshift cluster. This process may take some time depending on the size of the cluster.
11. Once the modification is complete, your Amazon Redshift cluster will be encrypted with the specified Customer Managed Key (CMK).
