### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Redshift Clusters not being encrypted with KMS CMKs in AWS, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Amazon Redshift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/.
2. Choose the Redshift cluster that you want to encrypt.
3. Choose the "Cluster" tab in the navigation pane.
4. Choose the "Properties" tab.
5. In the "Encryption" section, choose "Modify".
6. Choose "Enable" for the "Encryption" option.
7. In the "Master key" section, choose the KMS CMK that you want to use for encryption.
8. Choose "Apply Changes".

Once you have followed the above steps, the Redshift cluster will be encrypted with KMS CMKs.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Redshift Clusters Should Be Encrypted With KMS CMKs" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Type the following command to enable encryption for an existing Redshift cluster:

```
aws redshift modify-cluster --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --encrypted --kms-key-id <kms-key-id>
```

Note: Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the identifier of the Redshift cluster you want to encrypt and `<kms-key-id>` with the ID of the KMS customer master key (CMK) you want to use for encryption.

3. If you want to create a new Redshift cluster with encryption enabled, use the following command:

```
aws redshift create-cluster --encrypted --kms-key-id <kms-key-id> --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --node-type <node-type> --master-username <master-username> --master-user-password <master-user-password>
```

Note: Replace `<kms-key-id>` with the ID of the KMS customer master key (CMK) you want to use for encryption, `<cluster-identifier>` with the identifier of the new Redshift cluster, `<node-type>` with the type of node you want to use for the cluster, `<master-username>` with the master user name for the cluster, and `<master-user-password>` with the master user password for the cluster.

4. Verify that the Redshift cluster is encrypted by checking the "Encrypted" column in the AWS Management Console or by using the following command:

```
aws redshift describe-clusters --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --query "Clusters[*].Encrypted"
```

Note: Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the identifier of the Redshift cluster you want to check.

5. Repeat the above steps for all Redshift clusters in your AWS environment to ensure that they are encrypted with KMS CMKs.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Redshift clusters not being encrypted with KMS CMKs in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Redshift Clusters page.

2. Select the Redshift cluster that needs to be encrypted and note down the cluster identifier.

3. Open the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) page and create a new Customer Master Key (CMK) or use an existing one.

4. Once the CMK is created, note down the ARN of the key.

5. Open the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and create a new client for the Redshift service.

6. Use the `modify_cluster` method to modify the cluster and enable encryption with the KMS CMK ARN.

```python
import boto3

# Create a new client for the Redshift service
redshift = boto3.client('redshift')

# Modify the Redshift cluster to enable encryption with KMS CMK ARN
response = redshift.modify_cluster(
    ClusterIdentifier='your-cluster-identifier',
    Encrypted=True,
    KmsKeyId='your-kms-cmk-arn'
)
```

7. Verify that the encryption is enabled by checking the cluster details in the AWS Management Console or by using the `describe_clusters` method in Boto3.

```python
# Use the describe_clusters method to check the cluster details
response = redshift.describe_clusters(
    ClusterIdentifier='your-cluster-identifier'
)

# Check if encryption is enabled
if response['Clusters'][0]['Encrypted']:
    print('Encryption is enabled for the Redshift cluster.')
else:
    print('Encryption is not enabled for the Redshift cluster.')
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Redshift clusters not being encrypted with KMS CMKs in AWS using Python.
