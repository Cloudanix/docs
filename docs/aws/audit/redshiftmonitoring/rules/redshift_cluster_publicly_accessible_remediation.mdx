### Remediation

#### Using Console

Here are the step by step instructions to remediate the issue of Redshift Cluster being publicly accessible in AWS:

1. Log in to your AWS console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon Redshift console.
3. Select the Redshift cluster that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Properties" tab.
5. Under the "Network and security" section, click on the "Edit" button.
6. In the "Cluster publicly accessible" section, uncheck the box to disable public access to the cluster.
7. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, your Redshift cluster will no longer be publicly accessible and will only be accessible within your private network. It is recommended to regularly review the security groups associated with your Redshift cluster to ensure that they are properly configured to restrict access to only authorized users and applications.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Redshift Cluster Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to describe the Redshift cluster:

```
aws redshift describe-clusters --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --region <region>
```

Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the identifier of the Redshift cluster and `<region>` with the region where the cluster is located.

2. Check the value of the `PubliclyAccessible` parameter. If it is set to `true`, then the cluster is publicly accessible.

3. To remediate this misconfiguration, run the following command to modify the cluster and disable public accessibility:

```
aws redshift modify-cluster --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --no-publicly-accessible --region <region>
```

This command will modify the Redshift cluster and disable public accessibility.

4. Finally, run the following command to confirm that the cluster is no longer publicly accessible:

```
aws redshift describe-clusters --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --region <region>
```

Check the value of the `PubliclyAccessible` parameter. It should now be set to `false`.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Redshift Cluster Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Redshift Cluster being publicly accessible in AWS, you can follow the below steps using Python:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```
import boto3
```

2. Create a boto3 client for Redshift:

```
redshift = boto3.client('redshift')
```

3. Get a list of all the Redshift Clusters:

```
clusters = redshift.describe_clusters()
```

4. For each cluster, check if it is publicly accessible:

```
for cluster in clusters['Clusters']:
    if cluster['PubliclyAccessible']:
        # Update the cluster to be not publicly accessible
        redshift.modify_cluster(
            ClusterIdentifier=cluster['ClusterIdentifier'],
            PubliclyAccessible=False
        )
```

5. Verify that the update was successful:

```
cluster = redshift.describe_clusters(ClusterIdentifier=cluster['ClusterIdentifier'])
if not cluster['Clusters'][0]['PubliclyAccessible']:
    print(f"Cluster {cluster['Clusters'][0]['ClusterIdentifier']} is no longer publicly accessible.")
```

6. Run the above code to remediate the Redshift Cluster being publicly accessible.
