### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon Redshift dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Clusters". The Clusters page displays a list of all your current Amazon Redshift clusters.
3. Click on the cluster name you want to inspect. This will open the cluster details page.
4. In the cluster details page, check the "Publicly accessible" attribute. If the attribute is set to "Yes", then the master node of the selected Amazon Redshift cluster is reachable from the internet, indicating a potential misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the EMR clusters.

2. Once the AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can list all the EMR clusters using the following command:

   ```
   aws emr list-clusters --active
   ```
   This command will return a list of all active EMR clusters.

3. For each cluster, you can describe the cluster to get more details. Use the following command:

   ```
   aws emr describe-cluster --cluster-id <Cluster_ID>
   ```
   Replace `<Cluster_ID>` with the ID of the cluster you want to check. This command will return a JSON object with details about the cluster.

4. To check if the master node has a public IP, you need to look at the `Ec2InstanceAttributes` field in the returned JSON object. If the `Ec2InstanceAttributes` field contains a `Ec2PublicIpAddress` field, then the master node has a public IP. If the `Ec2PublicIpAddress` field is not present, then the master node does not have a public IP.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your local environment. Boto3 allows you to directly create, update, and delete AWS services from your Python scripts.

```python
pip install boto3
aws configure
```

2. Create a Python script that uses Boto3 to interact with the AWS Redshift service. The script will list all the clusters and their respective properties.

```python
import boto3

def list_clusters():
    client = boto3.client('redshift')
    response = client.describe_clusters()
    return response['Clusters']

clusters = list_clusters()
for cluster in clusters:
    print(f"Cluster ID: {cluster['ClusterIdentifier']}, Publicly Accessible: {cluster['PubliclyAccessible']}")
```

3. The script will print out whether each cluster is publicly accessible or not. If the 'PubliclyAccessible' property is set to 'True', then the EMR Cluster Master Node has a public IP.

4. To specifically check for EMR Cluster Master Node, you need to check the 'MasterPublicIP' attribute. If this attribute is not 'None' or empty, then the EMR Cluster Master Node has a public IP.

```python
for cluster in clusters:
    if cluster['PubliclyAccessible']:
        print(f"Cluster ID: {cluster['ClusterIdentifier']}, Master Public IP: {cluster['MasterPublicIP']}")
```

This script will print out the Cluster ID and Master Public IP of all publicly accessible clusters. If the Master Public IP is not 'None' or empty, then the EMR Cluster Master Node has a public IP.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of EMR Cluster Master Node having a public IP in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Access the AWS Management Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/).

2. **Navigate to EMR Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown in the top left corner, search for "EMR" (Elastic MapReduce), and click on it to open the EMR dashboard.

3. **Select the EMR Cluster**: From the list of EMR clusters, select the cluster where the Master Node has a public IP address that needs to be remediated.

4. **Update Security Configuration**:
    - Click on the "Security and access" tab in the cluster details.
    - Under the "Security groups" section, click on the security group associated with the Master Node.

5. **Edit Security Group Rules**:
    - In the security group settings, locate the inbound rule that allows inbound traffic to the Master Node from the internet (0.0.0.0/0).
    - Edit the inbound rule to restrict access to the Master Node by changing the source IP range to a specific IP or CIDR block that needs access.

6. **Remove Public IP**:
    - In the EMR Cluster settings, find the Master Node configuration.
    - Update the network settings to remove the public IP assignment for the Master Node.

7. **Save Changes**: Once you have made the necessary changes to the security group rules and network settings, save the configuration changes.

8. **Verify Configuration**:
    - After saving the changes, verify that the Master Node no longer has a public IP address assigned to it.
    - Test the connectivity to ensure that the necessary access is still available without exposing the Master Node to the public internet.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of an EMR Cluster Master Node having a public IP address in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of having a public IP assigned to the EMR Cluster Master Node in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS CLI:

1. Identify the EMR Cluster Master Node:
   Run the following AWS CLI command to describe the cluster and identify the Master Node's public IP address:
   ```
   aws emr describe-cluster --cluster-id YOUR_CLUSTER_ID --query 'Cluster.MasterPublicDnsName'
   ```

2. Modify the Security Group associated with the EMR Cluster:
   Run the following AWS CLI command to identify the security group attached to the EMR Cluster:
   ```
   aws emr describe-cluster --cluster-id YOUR_CLUSTER_ID --query 'Cluster.SecurityGroups[0].Name'
   ```

3. Update the Security Group to remove the inbound rule allowing SSH (port 22) access from 0.0.0.0/0:
   Run the following AWS CLI command to revoke the ingress rule for port 22:
   ```
   aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id YOUR_SECURITY_GROUP_ID --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
   ```

4. Verify the Public IP has been removed:
   Run the following AWS CLI command to describe the cluster and confirm that the Master Node no longer has a public IP address:
   ```
   aws emr describe-cluster --cluster-id YOUR_CLUSTER_ID --query 'Cluster.MasterPublicDnsName'
   ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having a public IP assigned to the EMR Cluster Master Node in AWS using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of the EMR Cluster Master Node having a public IP in AWS, you can follow these steps using Python and Boto3:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Initialize the AWS client for EMR:
```python
emr_client = boto3.client('emr', region_name='your_region')
```

3. Identify the EMR Cluster ID for the cluster with the Master Node having a public IP:
```python
cluster_id = 'your_cluster_id'
```

4. Describe the cluster to get the current configuration:
```python
response = emr_client.describe_cluster(ClusterId=cluster_id)
```

5. Check if the Master Public DNS Name is present in the response:
```python
if 'MasterPublicDnsName' in response['Cluster']:
    # Disassociate the public IP from the Master Node
    emr_client.modify_instance_fleet(ClusterId=cluster_id, InstanceFleet={ 'InstanceFleetType': 'MASTER', 'TargetOnDemandCapacity': 1 })
    print("Public IP removed from Master Node successfully.")
else:
    print("Master Node does not have a public IP.")
```

6. Run the Python script to remediate the misconfiguration and remove the public IP from the Master Node of the EMR Cluster.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of the EMR Cluster Master Node having a public IP in AWS using Python and Boto3.
