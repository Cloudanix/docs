1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon Redshift console.
3. In the navigation pane, choose "Clusters".
4. In the list of clusters, choose the name of the cluster that you want to check. This will open the cluster details page.
5. In the cluster details page, look for the "VPC Security Groups" section. If the associated security group has a rule that allows inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 (the internet), then the EMR Cluster Master Node has a public IP.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will need to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the EMR clusters using the following command:

   ```
   aws emr list-clusters --active
   ```

   This command will return a list of all active EMR clusters.

3. For each cluster, you can describe the cluster and get the details of the master node using the following command:

   ```
   aws emr describe-cluster --cluster-id <Cluster_ID>
   ```

   Replace `<Cluster_ID>` with the ID of your cluster. This command will return a JSON output with the details of the cluster.

4. In the JSON output, look for the "MasterPublicDnsName" field. If this field is present and not empty, it means that the master node has a public IP address. If the field is not present or empty, it means that the master node does not have a public IP address. 

   Note: The "MasterPublicDnsName" field will only be present if the master node has a public IP address. If the field is not present, it means that the master node does not have a public IP address.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your local environment. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the EMR clusters.

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the EMR client.

```python
import boto3

# Create an EMR client
client = boto3.client('emr')
```

3. Fetch the list of all EMR clusters and iterate over them to check the master node's public IP.

```python
# Get the list of all clusters
clusters = client.list_clusters()

# Iterate over each cluster
for cluster in clusters['Clusters']:
    # Get the cluster id
    cluster_id = cluster['Id']
    
    # Describe the cluster
    cluster_description = client.describe_cluster(ClusterId=cluster_id)
    
    # Get the master public DNS
    master_public_dns = cluster_description['Cluster']['MasterPublicDnsName']
    
    # If the master public DNS is not empty, it means the master node has a public IP
    if master_public_dns:
        print(f"EMR Cluster {cluster_id} Master Node has a public IP")
```

4. The above script will print the cluster id of all EMR clusters where the master node has a public IP. You can further enhance this script to send notifications or take remedial actions as per your requirements.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of EMR Cluster Master Node having a public IP in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Access the AWS Management Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/).

2. **Navigate to EMR Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown in the top left corner, search for "EMR" (Elastic MapReduce), and click on it to open the EMR dashboard.

3. **Select the EMR Cluster**: From the list of EMR clusters, select the cluster where the Master Node has a public IP address that needs to be remediated.

4. **Update Security Configuration**:
    - Click on the "Security and access" tab in the cluster details.
    - Under the "Security groups" section, click on the security group associated with the Master Node.

5. **Edit Security Group Rules**:
    - In the security group settings, locate the inbound rule that allows inbound traffic to the Master Node from the internet (0.0.0.0/0).
    - Edit the inbound rule to restrict access to the Master Node by changing the source IP range to a specific IP or CIDR block that needs access.

6. **Remove Public IP**:
    - In the EMR Cluster settings, find the Master Node configuration.
    - Update the network settings to remove the public IP assignment for the Master Node.

7. **Save Changes**: Once you have made the necessary changes to the security group rules and network settings, save the configuration changes.

8. **Verify Configuration**:
    - After saving the changes, verify that the Master Node no longer has a public IP address assigned to it.
    - Test the connectivity to ensure that the necessary access is still available without exposing the Master Node to the public internet.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of an EMR Cluster Master Node having a public IP address in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of having a public IP assigned to the EMR Cluster Master Node in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS CLI:

1. Identify the EMR Cluster Master Node:
   Run the following AWS CLI command to describe the cluster and identify the Master Node's public IP address:
   ```
   aws emr describe-cluster --cluster-id YOUR_CLUSTER_ID --query 'Cluster.MasterPublicDnsName'
   ```

2. Modify the Security Group associated with the EMR Cluster:
   Run the following AWS CLI command to identify the security group attached to the EMR Cluster:
   ```
   aws emr describe-cluster --cluster-id YOUR_CLUSTER_ID --query 'Cluster.SecurityGroups[0].Name'
   ```

3. Update the Security Group to remove the inbound rule allowing SSH (port 22) access from 0.0.0.0/0:
   Run the following AWS CLI command to revoke the ingress rule for port 22:
   ```
   aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id YOUR_SECURITY_GROUP_ID --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
   ```

4. Verify the Public IP has been removed:
   Run the following AWS CLI command to describe the cluster and confirm that the Master Node no longer has a public IP address:
   ```
   aws emr describe-cluster --cluster-id YOUR_CLUSTER_ID --query 'Cluster.MasterPublicDnsName'
   ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having a public IP assigned to the EMR Cluster Master Node in AWS using the AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of the EMR Cluster Master Node having a public IP in AWS, you can follow these steps using Python and Boto3:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Initialize the AWS client for EMR:
```python
emr_client = boto3.client('emr', region_name='your_region')
```

3. Identify the EMR Cluster ID for the cluster with the Master Node having a public IP:
```python
cluster_id = 'your_cluster_id'
```

4. Describe the cluster to get the current configuration:
```python
response = emr_client.describe_cluster(ClusterId=cluster_id)
```

5. Check if the Master Public DNS Name is present in the response:
```python
if 'MasterPublicDnsName' in response['Cluster']:
    # Disassociate the public IP from the Master Node
    emr_client.modify_instance_fleet(ClusterId=cluster_id, InstanceFleet={ 'InstanceFleetType': 'MASTER', 'TargetOnDemandCapacity': 1 })
    print("Public IP removed from Master Node successfully.")
else:
    print("Master Node does not have a public IP.")
```

6. Run the Python script to remediate the misconfiguration and remove the public IP from the Master Node of the EMR Cluster.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of the EMR Cluster Master Node having a public IP in AWS using Python and Boto3.
