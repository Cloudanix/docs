### More Info:

Ensure that all Amazon EMR cluster log files are periodically archived and uploaded to S3 in order to keep the logging data for historical purposes or to track and analyze the EMR clusters behavior for a long period of time.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of EMR Cluster Logging not being enabled on AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the Amazon EMR service.

3. Select the EMR cluster that needs to be remediated.

4. Click on the "Edit" button to edit the cluster configuration.

5. Scroll down to the "Logging" section and click on "Enable Logging."

6. In the "S3 Bucket" field, enter the name of the S3 bucket where you want to store the logs.

7. In the "S3 Prefix" field, enter the prefix for the logs.

8. Click on "Save" to save the changes.

9. Wait for the EMR cluster to reconfigure and enable logging.

10. Verify that logging is enabled by checking the S3 bucket for the logs.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration of EMR Cluster Logging not being enabled on AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the EMR Cluster Logging issue in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Check the current status of the EMR Cluster Logging by running the following command:

   ```
   aws emr describe-cluster --cluster-id <cluster-id> --query 'Cluster.LogUri'
   ```

   Replace `<cluster-id>` with the ID of the EMR cluster for which you want to check the logging status.

   If the response shows an empty value or null, it means that the logging is not enabled.

3. Enable EMR Cluster Logging by running the following command:

   ```
   aws emr modify-cluster-attributes --cluster-id <cluster-id> --log-uri s3://<bucket-name>/<prefix>/
   ```

   Replace `<cluster-id>` with the ID of the EMR cluster for which you want to enable logging, `<bucket-name>` with the name of the S3 bucket where you want to store the logs, and `<prefix>` with the prefix for the log files.

4. Verify that the logging is enabled by running the command from step 2 again. The response should show the S3 URI for the log files.

5. Optionally, you can also enable logging for individual steps in the EMR cluster by specifying the `--enable-debugging` parameter when you create the step.

   ```
   aws emr add-steps --cluster-id <cluster-id> --steps Type=<step-type>,Name=<step-name>,ActionOnFailure=<action>,Args=[<args>], --enable-debugging
   ```

   Replace `<step-type>`, `<step-name>`, `<action>`, and `<args>` with the details of the step you want to create.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "EMR Cluster Logging Should Be Enabled" in AWS, you can use the following steps using Python:

1. Import the Boto3 library to interact with AWS services.
```
import boto3
```
2. Create a client to interact with the EMR service.
```
emr = boto3.client('emr')
```
3. Get a list of all the EMR clusters in your account.
```
response = emr.list_clusters()
clusters = response['Clusters']
```
4. Loop through each cluster and check if logging is enabled.
```
for cluster in clusters:
    cluster_id = cluster['Id']
    response = emr.describe_cluster(ClusterId=cluster_id)
    logging_enabled = response['Cluster']['LogUri']
    if logging_enabled == None:
        emr.modify_cluster_attributes(ClusterId=cluster_id, LogUri='s3://your-bucket/logs/')
```
5. If logging is not enabled, modify the cluster attributes to enable logging by providing an S3 bucket URI where the logs will be stored.

Note: Replace "your-bucket" with the name of your S3 bucket where you want to store the logs.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "EMR Cluster Logging Should Be Enabled" in AWS using Python.
