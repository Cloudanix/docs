### More Info:

The automated snapshot retention period set for your AWS Redshift clusters should be a positive number, meaning that automated backups are enabled for the clusters.

### Risk Level

Low

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR, NISTCSF, PCIDSS

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "Redshift Automated Snapshots Should Have Retention Period Enabled" in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Open the Amazon Redshift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Snapshots".
3. Select the automated snapshot for which you want to enable a retention period.
4. Choose "Modify Retention" from the "Actions" dropdown menu.
5. In the "Modify Retention" dialog box, set the retention period for the snapshot.
6. Choose "Modify" to save the changes.

After following these steps, the retention period will be enabled for the selected automated snapshot. This will ensure that the snapshot is retained for the specified period, and can be restored if needed.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Redshift Automated Snapshots not having retention period enabled in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or CloudShell.

2. Run the following command to enable the retention period for automated snapshots:

```
aws redshift modify-cluster-snapshot-schedule --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --snapshot-retention-period <number-of-days>
```

Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the identifier of the Redshift cluster that you want to remediate and `<number-of-days>` with the number of days you want to retain the automated snapshots.

3. Verify that the retention period has been enabled by running the following command:

```
aws redshift describe-cluster-snapshot-schedules --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier>
```

This command will display the details of the Redshift cluster snapshot schedule, including the retention period.

4. Repeat the above steps for all the Redshift clusters in your AWS account.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Redshift Automated Snapshots not having retention period enabled in AWS.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Redshift Automated Snapshots Should Have Retention Period Enabled" for AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK libraries in Python:
```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Create a Redshift client object using boto3:
```python
redshift_client = boto3.client('redshift')
```

3. Get a list of all the Redshift clusters in the AWS account:
```python
clusters = redshift_client.describe_clusters()
```

4. Iterate through each cluster and check if automated snapshots are enabled:
```python
for cluster in clusters['Clusters']:
    cluster_identifier = cluster['ClusterIdentifier']
    automated_snapshot_retention_period = cluster['AutomatedSnapshotRetentionPeriod']
    if automated_snapshot_retention_period == None:
        # Enable automated snapshot retention period
        try:
            redshift_client.modify_cluster(
                ClusterIdentifier=cluster_identifier,
                AutomatedSnapshotRetentionPeriod=7 # set retention period to 7 days
            )
            print(f"Automated snapshot retention period enabled for cluster {cluster_identifier}")
        except ClientError as e:
            print(f"Error enabling automated snapshot retention period for cluster {cluster_identifier}: {e}")
    else:
        print(f"Automated snapshot retention period already enabled for cluster {cluster_identifier}")
```

5. Run the Python script to enable automated snapshot retention period for all Redshift clusters in the AWS account.

Note: In step 4, you can modify the retention period value as per your requirement.
