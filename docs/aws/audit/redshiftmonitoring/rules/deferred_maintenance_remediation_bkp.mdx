How to enable deferred maintenance for redshift clusters?

#### Using AWS Console

As of September 2021, there is no specific feature or configuration called "deferred maintenance" for Amazon Redshift clusters. However, you can follow best practices and perform regular maintenance tasks to ensure optimal performance and minimize disruptions. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Cluster Maintenance Window: Amazon Redshift provides a maintenance window during which it automatically performs necessary maintenance tasks, such as updates and patches. By default, the maintenance window is set to a 30-minute window chosen by AWS. You can review and adjust the maintenance window settings according to your requirements.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Redshift Clusters Should Have Deferred Maintenance Enabled" Policy.)
2. Monitoring Cluster Performance: Utilize Amazon Redshift performance metrics and logs to monitor the health and performance of your clusters. This includes monitoring query performance, disk usage, and system alerts. Regular monitoring helps you identify any potential issues and take appropriate actions.
3. Apply Recommended Updates: Stay up to date with the latest Amazon Redshift updates, patches, and bug fixes. AWS regularly releases updates to improve performance, security, and reliability. It's recommended to review the AWS documentation and apply the recommended updates to your clusters.
4. Data Distribution and Sort Keys: Optimize the distribution and sort keys for your Redshift tables to improve query performance. Analyze the query patterns and access patterns of your data and adjust the keys accordingly. This optimization helps to distribute the data evenly across the cluster and minimize data movement during queries.
5. Vacuum and Analyze: Regularly run the VACUUM and ANALYZE commands to reclaim disk space and update statistics for better query planning. These commands help to optimize storage and improve query performance by ensuring accurate statistics.
6. Backup and Restore: Implement regular backup and restore procedures to protect your data and ensure recoverability in case of any failures. Redshift offers automated snapshot backups, and you can configure retention periods and schedule regular backups based on your data retention requirements.
7. Security and Access Control: Implement appropriate security measures, including encryption at rest and in transit, and enforce proper access control using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Redshift's security features. Regularly review and update your security settings to align with your organization's policies and best practices.
