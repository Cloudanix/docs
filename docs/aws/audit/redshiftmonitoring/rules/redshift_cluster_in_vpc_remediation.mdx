How to launch Redshift cluster within a VPC?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the left navigation panel, under Redshift Dashboard, click Clusters and then Click Launch Cluster from the dashboard top menu to start the cluster setup process.

- Step 2: On the Cluster Details configuration page, enter a unique name for your new cluster in the Cluster Identifier field and fill out the rest of the fields available on this page with the information from the existing cluster, launched with the EC2-Classic platform.

- Step 3: Click the Continue button to continue. On the Node Configuration page, select the appropriate node type for the new cluster from the Node Type dropdown list and configure the number of nodes used to match the existing (EC2-Classic) cluster configuration. Click Continue to go to the next page.

- Step 4: On the Additional Configuration page, perform the following actions:
  A: Within the first configuration section, select the parameter group to associate with the cluster from the Cluster Parameter Group dropdown list and make sure that the cluster database encryption configuration does match the existing EC2-Classic cluster configuration.
  B: Within the Configure Networking Options section, provide the following information: - Select the name of the Virtual Private Cloud in which you want to launch the cluster from the Choose a VPC dropdown list. - Select the name of the subnet group that you want to assign to your cluster from the Cluster Subnet Group dropdown list. Choose default to use the default subnet group created automatically for your EC2-VPC Redshift clusters. - For Publicly Accessible, choose whether or not you want the cluster to be publicly accessible on the Internet. If you select Yes, you can also choose to attach an elastic IP (EIP) using the Choose a Public IP Address setting. - For Enhanced VPC Routing, you can choose whether or not to enable the Enhanced VPC Routing feature that provides the capability to force all COPY/UNLOAD traffic between the cluster and your data repository through the VPC network selected above. - Select the name of the availability zone in which you want to launch the cluster from the Availability Zone dropdown list.
  C: Select the appropriate security group(s) to associate with your new cluster from the VPC Security Groups list.
  D: (Optional) For Create CloudWatch Alarm, choose whether or not you want to create an AWS CloudWatch alarm to monitor the cluster disk usage.
  E: (Optional) Select an existing role from the AvailableRoles dropdown list if you need to associate an IAM role with your Redshift cluster.

- Step 5: Click Continue to load the next page. On the Review page, review the new cluster properties, its database details and the VPC environment configuration details where it will be provisioned, then click Launch Cluster to launch the cluster.

- Step 6: On the confirmation page click Close to return to the Redshift dashboard. Once the Cluster Status value changes to available and the DB Health status changes to healthy, the new cluster can used to load the existing data from the one created with the EC2-Classic platform.

- Step 7: Unload your data from the EC2-Classic Redshift cluster and reload it into the newly created cluster using the Amazon Redshift Unload/Copy utility. With this utility tool you can unload (export) your data from the unencrypted cluster (source) to an AWS S3 bucket, then import it into your new cluster (destination) and clean up the S3 bucket used. All the necessary instructions to install, configure and use the Amazon Redshift Unload/Copy tool can be found at this URL.

- Step 8: As soon as the migration process is completed and all the data is loaded into the new Redshift cluster, launched within your Virtual Private Cloud, you can update your application configuration to refer to the new cluster endpoint:
- Step 9: Once the Redshift cluster endpoint is changed within your application configuration, you can remove the EC2-Classic cluster from your AWS account by performing the following actions:
  A: In the navigation panel, under Redshift Dashboard, click Clusters.
  B: Choose the Redshift cluster that you want to remove then click on its identifier link available in the Cluster column.
  C: On the selected cluster Configuration tab, click the Cluster dropdown button from the dashboard main menu then select Delete from the dropdown list.
