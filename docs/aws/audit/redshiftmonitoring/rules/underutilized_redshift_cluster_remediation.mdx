### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Clusters". This will display a list of all your Redshift clusters.

3. Select the cluster that you want to check for underutilization. This will open the cluster details page.

4. In the cluster details page, check the "Performance" tab. Here, you can see the CPU utilization, database connections, and query performance. If the CPU utilization and database connections are consistently low over a long period of time, it indicates that the cluster is underutilized.

#### Using CLI

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you can start, make sure you have AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Then configure it using:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You'll be asked to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. **List all Redshift Clusters**: Use the following command to list all the Redshift clusters:
   ```
   aws redshift describe-clusters
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the Redshift clusters.

3. **Check CPU Utilization**: For each cluster, check the CPU utilization. You can use the following command to get the CPU utilization:
   ```
   aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace "AWS/Redshift" --metric-name "CPUUtilization" --dimensions Name=ClusterIdentifier,Value=<your-cluster-identifier> --start-time <start-time> --end-time <end-time> --period 3600 --statistics "Average" --unit "Percent"
   ```
   Replace `<your-cluster-identifier>` with your cluster's identifier, and `<start-time>` and `<end-time>` with the time period you want to check. This command will return the average CPU utilization for the specified period.

4. **Analyze the Output**: If the CPU utilization is consistently low (for example, less than 20%), the Redshift cluster may be underutilized. You may need to consider resizing the cluster or optimizing your queries to make better use of the resources.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) on your local system. Boto3 allows you to directly create, update, and delete AWS services from your Python scripts.

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials.

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Use the `describe_clusters` method from the Redshift client to get the details of all the Redshift clusters. 

```python
redshift_client = session.client('redshift')
clusters = redshift_client.describe_clusters()
```

4. For each cluster, check the `NumberOfNodes` and `NodeType` attributes to determine the capacity of the cluster. Then, use the `get_cluster_credentials` method to get the database credentials and use them to connect to the database. Run a query to determine the utilization of the cluster. If the utilization is consistently low, the cluster is underutilized.

```python
import psycopg2

for cluster in clusters['Clusters']:
    cluster_identifier = cluster['ClusterIdentifier']
    node_type = cluster['NodeType']
    number_of_nodes = cluster['NumberOfNodes']

    # Get database credentials
    creds = redshift_client.get_cluster_credentials(
        DbUser='YOUR_DB_USER',
        DbName='YOUR_DB_NAME',
        ClusterIdentifier=cluster_identifier,
        AutoCreate=False
    )

    # Connect to the database
    conn = psycopg2.connect(
        dbname='YOUR_DB_NAME',
        user=creds['DbUser'],
        password=creds['DbPassword'],
        port='5439',
        host=cluster['Endpoint']['Address']
    )

    # Run a query to determine utilization
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stv_sessions WHERE user_name = 'YOUR_DB_USER';")
    utilization = cur.fetchone()[0]

    # Check if the cluster is underutilized
    if utilization < number_of_nodes * 0.5:  # This is just an example, adjust the threshold as needed
        print(f"Cluster {cluster_identifier} is underutilized.")
```

Please replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', 'YOUR_REGION', 'YOUR_DB_USER', and 'YOUR_DB_NAME' with your actual AWS access key, secret key, region, database user, and database name respectively.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of an underutilized Redshift cluster in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Monitor Cluster Performance**:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon Redshift service.
   - Select your Redshift cluster that is underutilized.
   - Click on the "Clusters" tab and then select the specific cluster.
   - Monitor the performance metrics such as CPU utilization, disk space usage, and query performance to identify areas of underutilization.

2. **Resize the Cluster**:
   - If the performance metrics indicate that the cluster is underutilized, consider resizing the cluster to better match the workload requirements.
   - Click on the "Modify" button for the selected cluster.
   - Adjust the number of nodes or the node type based on the workload demands. You can scale up or down the cluster size as needed.

3. **Optimize Query Performance**:
   - Analyze the queries running on the cluster to identify any inefficient queries that may be impacting performance.
   - Optimize the queries by adding appropriate sort keys, distribution keys, and performing necessary tuning.
   - Consider using Amazon Redshift Advisor to get recommendations for optimizing query performance.

4. **Implement Auto Scaling**:
   - Configure Auto Scaling for your Redshift cluster to automatically adjust the number of nodes based on the workload demand.
   - Enable Auto Scaling by setting up the minimum and maximum number of nodes for the cluster.

5. **Monitor and Fine-tune**:
