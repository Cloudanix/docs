1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Clusters". This will display a list of all your Redshift clusters.

3. Select the cluster that you want to check for underutilization. This will open the cluster details page.

4. In the cluster details page, check the "Performance" tab. Here, you can see various metrics related to the cluster's performance such as CPU Utilization, Database Connections, and Query Performance. If the CPU Utilization is consistently low (for example, below 20%) and the Database Connections are not many, it indicates that the cluster may be underutilized.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you can start, make sure you have AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Then configure it using:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You'll be asked to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. **List all Redshift Clusters**: Use the following command to list all the Redshift clusters:
   ```
   aws redshift describe-clusters
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the Redshift clusters.

3. **Check the Performance Metrics**: For each cluster, you need to check the performance metrics to determine if it's underutilized. You can use the following command to get the performance metrics:
   ```
   aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace "AWS/Redshift" --metric-name "CPUUtilization" --dimensions Name=ClusterIdentifier,Value=<your-cluster-identifier> --start-time <start-time> --end-time <end-time> --period 3600 --statistics "Average" --unit "Percent"
   ```
   Replace `<your-cluster-identifier>`, `<start-time>`, and `<end-time>` with your actual cluster identifier and the time period for which you want to check the metrics. This command will return the average CPU utilization for the specified period.

4. **Analyze the Output**: If the CPU utilization is consistently low (for example, less than 20%) over a long period of time (for example, over the past month), it indicates that the Redshift cluster is underutilized. You might want to consider downsizing the cluster or shutting it down to save costs.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) on your local system. Boto3 allows you to directly create, update, and delete AWS services from your Python scripts.

```python
pip install boto3
aws configure
```

2. Create a Python script that uses Boto3 to interact with the AWS Redshift service. The script will list all the Redshift clusters and their performance data.

```python
import boto3

def list_clusters():
    client = boto3.client('redshift')
    response = client.describe_clusters()
    return response['Clusters']

def get_cluster_performance(cluster_identifier):
    client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
    response = client.get_metric_statistics(
        Namespace='AWS/Redshift',
        MetricName='CPUUtilization',
        Dimensions=[
            {
                'Name': 'ClusterIdentifier',
                'Value': cluster_identifier
            },
        ],
        StartTime=datetime.datetime.utcnow() - datetime.timedelta(seconds=600),
        EndTime=datetime.datetime.utcnow(),
        Period=60,
        Statistics=[
            'Average',
        ],
    )
    return response['Datapoints']
```

3. Iterate over each cluster and check its CPU utilization. If the CPU utilization is consistently low, the cluster may be underutilized.

```python
clusters = list_clusters()
for cluster in clusters:
    performance = get_cluster_performance(cluster['ClusterIdentifier'])
    average_cpu_utilization = sum([datapoint['Average'] for datapoint in performance]) / len(performance)
    if average_cpu_utilization < 20:  # adjust this threshold as needed
        print(f"Cluster {cluster['ClusterIdentifier']} is underutilized")
```

4. Run the script regularly (e.g., as a cron job) to monitor your Redshift clusters. Adjust the CPU utilization threshold and the time period as needed to fit your use case. Remember that occasional low utilization is normal, but consistent low utilization indicates that the cluster is underutilized.

<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the issue of an underutilized Redshift cluster in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Monitor Cluster Performance**:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon Redshift service.
   - Select your Redshift cluster that is underutilized.
   - Click on the "Clusters" tab and then select the specific cluster.
   - Monitor the performance metrics such as CPU utilization, disk space usage, and query performance to identify areas of underutilization.

2. **Resize the Cluster**:
   - If the performance metrics indicate that the cluster is underutilized, consider resizing the cluster to better match the workload requirements.
   - Click on the "Modify" button for the selected cluster.
   - Adjust the number of nodes or the node type based on the workload demands. You can scale up or down the cluster size as needed.

3. **Optimize Query Performance**:

To remediate an underutilized Redshift cluster in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Identify underutilized Redshift clusters**: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all Redshift clusters along with their utilization metrics:
   ```bash
   aws redshift describe-clusters
   ```

2. **Identify underutilized clusters**: Look for clusters with low CPU utilization, low query throughput, or high idle time to identify underutilized clusters.

3. **Modify the cluster**: Once you have identified the underutilized cluster, modify the cluster by resizing it to a smaller size to reduce costs. Use the following AWS CLI command to modify the cluster:
   ```bash
   aws redshift modify-cluster --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --node-type <new-node-type>
   ```
   Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the identifier of the underutilized cluster and `<new-node-type>` with the desired node type (e.g., `dc2.large`).

4. **Monitor the cluster**: After modifying the cluster, monitor the cluster's performance and utilization metrics using AWS CloudWatch or Redshift Console to ensure that the cluster is now properly utilized.

5. **Automate resizing**: To prevent underutilization in the future, consider setting up automated resizing policies using AWS CloudWatch Alarms and AWS Lambda to resize the cluster based on predefined utilization thresholds.
