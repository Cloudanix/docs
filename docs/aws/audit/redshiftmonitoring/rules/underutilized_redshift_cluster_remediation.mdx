### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the underutilization of Redshift cluster in AWS, follow the below steps:

1. Login to your AWS console and navigate to the Amazon Redshift dashboard.
2. Select the Redshift cluster that you want to remediate.
3. Click on the "Cluster Performance" tab.
4. In the "Cluster Performance" tab, you will see the "Average CPU Utilization" graph. Check if the CPU utilization is low.
5. If the CPU utilization is low, you can try the following remediation steps:
   - Increase the number of queries running on the cluster.
   - Increase the number of users accessing the cluster.
   - Increase the size of the cluster.
   - Use Redshift Spectrum to run queries against data stored in S3.
6. After implementing the remediation steps, monitor the "Average CPU Utilization" graph to ensure that the CPU utilization has increased.
7. If the CPU utilization has increased, then the underutilization of the Redshift cluster has been remediated.

Note: It is important to ensure that you do not overutilize the cluster, as this can lead to performance issues and increased costs.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Redshift Cluster Should Not be Underutilized" for AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Identify the underutilized Redshift cluster using the AWS CLI command:
```
aws redshift describe-clusters --query "Clusters[?ClusterStatus=='available']|[?NodeType=='ds2.xlarge']|[?EnhancedVpcRouting=='true']|[?NumberOfNodes==2]|[?((TotalStorageSizeInMegaBytes/1024/1024)/NodeCount)<10]" --output text --region <region-name>
```
This command will list all the available Redshift clusters with node type `ds2.xlarge`, enhanced VPC routing enabled, 2 nodes, and storage size less than 10 GB per node.

2. Check the Redshift cluster utilization metrics using the AWS CLI command:
```
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/Redshift --metric-name PercentageDiskSpaceUsed --dimensions Name=ClusterIdentifier,Value=<cluster-id> --start-time <start-time> --end-time <end-time> --period 3600 --statistics Maximum --region <region-name>
```
Replace `<cluster-id>` with the actual cluster identifier and `<start-time>` and `<end-time>` with the time range you want to check. This command will give you the maximum percentage of disk space used by the cluster during the specified time range.

3. If the cluster utilization is low, consider resizing the cluster to a smaller node type or reducing the number of nodes using the AWS CLI command:
```
aws redshift modify-cluster --cluster-identifier <cluster-id> --node-type <new-node-type> --number-of-nodes <new-number-of-nodes> --region <region-name>
```
Replace `<cluster-id>` with the actual cluster identifier, `<new-node-type>` with the desired node type, and `<new-number-of-nodes>` with the desired number of nodes. This command will modify the cluster configuration to the new node type and/or number of nodes.

4. Monitor the cluster utilization metrics after resizing the cluster to ensure that the utilization is optimal.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Redshift Cluster Should Not be Underutilized" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of underutilized Redshift cluster in AWS, you can use the following steps:

1. Identify the underutilized Redshift clusters by analyzing the CPU utilization, disk usage, and query performance metrics.

2. Once you have identified the underutilized clusters, you can resize them to a smaller instance type to reduce cost or to a larger instance type to improve performance.

3. You can also consider using Amazon Redshift's automatic workload management (WLM) feature to optimize query performance and resource utilization.

4. Another option is to use Amazon Redshift's concurrency scaling feature, which automatically adds and removes clusters to handle sudden spikes in workload.

5. You can also use AWS Lambda to automate the process of resizing the Redshift clusters based on the workload and performance metrics.

Here is an example Python script to resize a Redshift cluster:

```
import boto3

# Create a Redshift client
client = boto3.client('redshift')

# Specify the cluster identifier and the new node type
cluster_identifier = 'my-cluster'
new_node_type = 'dc2.large'

# Resize the cluster
response = client.modify_cluster(
    ClusterIdentifier=cluster_identifier,
    NodeType=new_node_type
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

Note: You will need to have appropriate AWS credentials and permissions to run this script. Also, make sure to test the script in a non-production environment before applying it to a production cluster.
