### More Info:

Ensure that your AWS Elastic MapReduce (EMR) clusters are encrypted in order to meet security and compliance requirements. Data encryption helps prevent unauthorized users from reading sensitive data available on your EMR clusters and their associated data storage systems. This includes data saved to persistent media, known as data at-rest, and data that can be intercepted as it travels through the network, known as data in-transit.

### Risk Level

High

### Address

Cost Optimisation, Security

### Compliance Standards

ISO27001, HIPAA, AWSWAF

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate EMR in-transit and at-rest encryption misconfiguration in AWS, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS EMR console.
2. Select the EMR cluster that you want to remediate.
3. Click on the "Security and Access" tab on the left-hand side of the console.
4. Under the "Encryption" section, click on the "Edit" button.
5. For in-transit encryption, select the "Enable" option for "Encryption in transit" and choose the appropriate SSL/TLS certificate.
6. For at-rest encryption, select the "Enable" option for "Encryption at rest" and choose the appropriate encryption key.
7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

After completing these steps, your EMR cluster will be remediated for in-transit and at-rest encryption.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the EMR in-transit and at-rest encryption misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to enable in-transit encryption for EMR clusters:

```
aws emr create-security-configuration --name "emr-in-transit-encryption" --security-configuration '{
  "EncryptionConfiguration": {
    "EnableInTransitEncryption": true
  }
}'
```

2. Run the following command to enable at-rest encryption for EMR clusters:

```
aws emr create-security-configuration --name "emr-at-rest-encryption" --security-configuration '{
  "EncryptionConfiguration": {
    "EnableAtRestEncryption": true
  }
}'
```

3. Once the security configurations are created, you can apply them to your EMR clusters by running the following command:

```
aws emr create-cluster --name "MyEMRCluster" --release-label emr-5.29.0 --applications Name=Spark --use-default-roles --ec2-attributes KeyName=myKey --instance-type m5.xlarge --instance-count 3 --configurations '[{"Classification":"emrfs-site","Properties":{"fs.s3.enableServerSideEncryption":"true","fs.s3.serverSideEncryptionAlgorithm":"AES256"}}]' --security-configuration "emr-in-transit-encryption" --security-configuration "emr-at-rest-encryption"
```

This command creates a new EMR cluster with in-transit and at-rest encryption enabled. You can also modify existing EMR clusters to enable encryption by using the `modify-cluster` command and specifying the appropriate security configurations.

Note: The above steps assume that you have already configured your AWS CLI with the appropriate credentials and permissions to create and modify EMR clusters.

#### Using Python

To remediate the EMR In-Transit and At-Rest Encryption misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. In-Transit Encryption: 
   - Create a new EMR cluster with the `--security-configuration` parameter and specify a security configuration that enables in-transit encryption.
   - You can create a security configuration using the `boto3` library and setting the `EncryptionConfiguration` parameter to `{'EnableInTransitEncryption': True}`. 
   - Here's a sample code to create a security configuration with in-transit encryption enabled:

   ```python
   import boto3

   emr = boto3.client('emr')

   response = emr.create_security_configuration(
       Name='emr-in-transit-encryption',
       SecurityConfiguration='{
           "EncryptionConfiguration": {
               "EnableInTransitEncryption": true
           }
       }'
   )
   ```

2. At-Rest Encryption:
   - Create a new S3 bucket with default encryption enabled using the `boto3` library. 
   - You can set the `ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration` parameter to `{"Rules": [{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {"SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"}}]}` to enable default encryption. 
   - Here's a sample code to create a new S3 bucket with default encryption enabled:

   ```python
   import boto3

   s3 = boto3.client('s3')

   response = s3.create_bucket(
       Bucket='my-bucket',
       CreateBucketConfiguration={
           'LocationConstraint': 'us-west-2'
       },
       ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration={
           'Rules': [
               {
                   'ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault': {
                       'SSEAlgorithm': 'AES256'
                   }
               }
           ]
       }
   )
   ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the EMR In-Transit and At-Rest Encryption misconfiguration in AWS using Python.
