### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the Redshift Reserved Node with Status - Payment Pending issue in AWS, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the Amazon Redshift console.
3. In the navigation pane, choose "Reserved Nodes."
4. Select the Reserved Node with the Payment Pending status.
5. Choose "Modify Reserved Node" from the "Actions" dropdown menu.
6. In the "Modify Reserved Node" dialog box, select the "Apply Immediately" checkbox.
7. Choose "Modify."

This will initiate the payment process for the Reserved Node and change the status to "Active." Once the payment is processed, the Reserved Node will be available for use.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Redshift Reserved Node Should Not Have Status - Payment Pending" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.
2. Run the following command to list all the reserved nodes in your AWS Redshift cluster:

   ```
   aws redshift describe-reserved-nodes
   ```

3. Identify the reserved node that has the status "Payment Pending".
4. Run the following command to modify the reserved node and change its status to "Active":

   ```
   aws redshift modify-reserved-node --reserved-node-id <reserved-node-id> --target-availability-zone <availability-zone> --reserved-node-offering-id <offering-id>
   ```

   Replace `<reserved-node-id>` with the ID of the reserved node that has the status "Payment Pending", `<availability-zone>` with the availability zone where the node is located, and `<offering-id>` with the ID of the reserved node offering that you want to apply to the node.

5. After running the command, the reserved node should now have the status "Active". You can confirm this by running the `describe-reserved-nodes` command again and checking the status of the node.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration "Redshift Reserved Node Should Not Have Status - Payment Pending" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Redshift Reserved Node Payment Pending status in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Boto3 library for Python. You can install it using pip by running the following command:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and set up the AWS credentials using the following code:

```
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

# Set up the AWS credentials
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION_NAME'
)

# Create a Redshift client
redshift = session.client('redshift')
```

3. Get the list of Reserved Nodes using the `describe_reserved_nodes` method of the Redshift client:

```
# Get the list of Reserved Nodes
reserved_nodes = redshift.describe_reserved_nodes()
```

4. Loop through the Reserved Nodes and check if any of them have a Payment Pending status. If a Reserved Node has a Payment Pending status, modify the status to Active using the `modify_reserved_node` method:

```
# Loop through the Reserved Nodes
for node in reserved_nodes['ReservedNodes']:
    # Check if the status is Payment Pending
    if node['State'] == 'payment-pending':
        # Modify the status to Active
        try:
            redshift.modify_reserved_node(
                ReservedNodeId=node['ReservedNodeId'],
                TargetReservedNodeOfferingId=node['OfferingId']
            )
            print(f"Reserved Node {node['ReservedNodeId']} status modified to Active")
        except ClientError as e:
            print(f"Error modifying Reserved Node {node['ReservedNodeId']}: {e}")
```

5. Run the Python script to remediate the Redshift Reserved Node Payment Pending status in AWS.
