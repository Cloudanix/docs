### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the Redshift Reserved Node Lease Expiration in the next 7 days issue in AWS, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon Redshift console.
3. Select the cluster that has the lease expiration issue.
4. Click on the "Reserved Nodes" tab.
5. Identify the node that has the lease expiration issue.
6. Click on the "Modify Reserved Node" button.
7. Select the "Purchase a new reserved node" option.
8. Choose the appropriate node type and select the number of nodes you want to purchase.
9. Select the lease term that you want to purchase.
10. Click on the "Purchase Reserved Node" button to complete the purchase.

Once the purchase is complete, the new reserved node will be available immediately and the lease expiration issue will be resolved.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of Redshift Reserved Node Lease Expiration in the next 7 days in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to list all the Redshift clusters in the AWS account:

```
aws redshift describe-clusters
```

3. Identify the Redshift cluster with a reserved node lease expiration in the next 7 days.

4. Run the following command to modify the reserved node lease for the identified cluster:

```
aws redshift modify-cluster --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --reserved-nodes-offering-id <reserved-nodes-offering-id>
```

Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the identifier of the identified cluster and `<reserved-nodes-offering-id>` with the new reserved node offering ID.

5. Verify the changes by running the following command:

```
aws redshift describe-reserved-nodes-offerings --reserved-nodes-offering-id <reserved-nodes-offering-id>
```

6. Once you have verified the changes, run the following command to apply the changes to the cluster:

```
aws redshift modify-cluster --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --apply-immediately
```

7. Verify the changes by running the following command:

```
aws redshift describe-clusters --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier>
```

The above steps will remediate the issue of Redshift Reserved Node Lease Expiration in the next 7 days in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of Redshift Reserved Node Lease Expiration In The Next 7 Days in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to check the reserved node leases that are expiring in the next 7 days. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to get the list of reserved nodes that are going to expire soon.

```python
import boto3

redshift = boto3.client('redshift')

response = redshift.describe_reserved_nodes(
    OfferingType='All Upfront'
)

expiring_nodes = []

for node in response['ReservedNodes']:
    if node['State'] == 'active' and node['StartTime'].days_remaining <= 7:
        expiring_nodes.append(node['ReservedNodeId'])
```

2. Once you have the list of expiring nodes, you can modify the lease duration to extend the expiration date. You can use the `modify_reserved_node` method of the Redshift client to update the lease duration.

```python
for node_id in expiring_nodes:
    response = redshift.modify_reserved_node(
        ReservedNodeId=node_id,
        NodeCount=1,
        ReservedNodeOfferingId='your-reserved-node-offering-id',
        Duration=1 # number of years to extend the lease
    )

    print(f"Extended lease for node {node_id}")
```

3. Finally, you can verify that the lease has been extended by checking the expiration date of the reserved node.

```python
response = redshift.describe_reserved_nodes(
    ReservedNodeId=node_id
)

expiration_date = response['ReservedNodes'][0]['EndTime']
print(f"New expiration date for node {node_id}: {expiration_date}")
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of Redshift Reserved Node Lease Expiration In The Next 7 Days in AWS using Python.
