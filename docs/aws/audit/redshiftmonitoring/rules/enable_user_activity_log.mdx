How to enable user activity logging for Redshift clusters?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Create an Amazon S3 Bucket: Start by creating an Amazon S3 bucket where the Redshift logs will be stored. You can use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs/APIs to create the bucket. Make sure to choose a unique name for the bucket and configure the necessary permissions.
2. Enable Enhanced VPC Routing (Optional): If your Redshift cluster is using a VPC, you can enable Enhanced VPC Routing to ensure that the logs are delivered through your VPC. This provides additional security and control over network traffic.
3. Enable Audit Logging: Access the Amazon Redshift management console and navigate to the cluster for which you want to enable user activity logging.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Redshift User Activity Logging Should Be Enabled" Policy.)
4. Modify Cluster: Click on the cluster name and choose the "Modify" option.
5. Enable Audit Logging: In the "Audit Logging" section, select the checkbox to enable audit logging for the cluster.
6. Specify Audit S3 Bucket: Provide the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the S3 bucket you created in step 1. This is where the Redshift logs will be stored.
7. Specify Audit S3 Prefix (Optional): If desired, you can specify a prefix to be added to the S3 object key for each log file. This helps organize the logs within the bucket.
8. Configure IAM Role: Choose an existing IAM role or create a new IAM role that has permission to write logs to the specified S3 bucket. The IAM role must have the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket and perform the required actions.
9. Apply Changes: Review the modifications and apply the changes to the Redshift cluster.
