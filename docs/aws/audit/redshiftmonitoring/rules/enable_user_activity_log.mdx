<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Redshift dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu, then selecting "Redshift" under the "Database" category.
3. In the Redshift dashboard, select "Clusters" from the left-hand menu. This will display a list of all your Redshift clusters.
4. For each cluster, select the cluster name to view its details. In the "Cluster Details" section, look for the "Database Audit Logging" field. If it is set to "Disabled", then User Activity Logging is not enabled for that Redshift cluster.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the Redshift clusters in your account using the following command:

   ```
   aws redshift describe-clusters --query 'Clusters[*].[ClusterIdentifier]' --output text
   ```

   This command will return a list of all Redshift cluster identifiers.

3. For each cluster, you can check if the User Activity Logging is enabled or not using the following command:

   ```
   aws redshift describe-logging-status --cluster-identifier <your-cluster-identifier>
   ```

   Replace `<your-cluster-identifier>` with your actual Redshift cluster identifier. This command will return the logging status of the specified Redshift cluster.

4. If the User Activity Logging is enabled, the "LoggingEnabled" field in the output will be set to true. If it's not enabled, the "LoggingEnabled" field will be set to false. You can use this information to detect if the User Activity Logging is enabled or not for each Redshift cluster in your account.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if Redshift User Activity Logging is enabled in Redshift using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary libraries and establish a client connection to AWS:**

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import BotoCoreError, ClientError

# Create a Redshift client
client = boto3.client('redshift', region_name='us-west-2') # replace 'us-west-2' with your region
```

2. **Retrieve the list of clusters:**

```python
try:
    response = client.describe_clusters()
except ClientError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

3. **Check the logging status for each cluster:**

```python
for cluster in response['Clusters']:
    try:
        logging_status = client.describe_logging_status(ClusterIdentifier=cluster['ClusterIdentifier'])
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

4. **Print the logging status:**

```python
    if logging_status['LoggingEnabled']:
        print(f"User Activity Logging is enabled for cluster: {cluster['ClusterIdentifier']}")
    else:
        print(f"User Activity Logging is NOT enabled for cluster: {cluster['ClusterIdentifier']}")
```

This script will print out whether User Activity Logging is enabled for each Redshift cluster in the specified region. If the logging is not enabled, it will print a message indicating so.
