How to terminate idle redshift clusters?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify Idle Clusters: Determine which Redshift clusters are considered idle based on your organization's criteria. For example, you may consider a cluster as idle if it hasn't had any query activity or connections for a specified period of time.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Idle Redshift Clusters Should Be Terminated" Policy.)
2. Review Cluster Status: Access the Amazon Redshift management console and navigate to the cluster list. Identify the clusters that meet the criteria for being idle.
3. Back up Data (if required): Before terminating a cluster, ensure that any necessary data or backups are securely stored. If you need to retain the data, create a snapshot of the cluster or export the data to another storage location.
4. Terminate the Cluster: Select the idle Redshift cluster from the cluster list and choose the "Actions" dropdown menu. Click on "Delete Cluster" or "Terminate Cluster" option. Follow the prompts to confirm the termination. Note that terminating a cluster is irreversible, and all data within the cluster will be permanently deleted.
5. Verify Termination: Once the termination process is initiated, monitor the cluster status to ensure it is successfully terminated. You can check the cluster list in the Redshift management console or use AWS CLI or SDKs/APIs to query the cluster status.
6. Clean Up Resources: After the cluster is terminated, review and clean up any associated resources. This may include deleting related security groups, parameter groups, snapshots, or other resources associated with the terminated cluster.
7. Review and Adjust Policies: Evaluate your organization's policies regarding cluster usage and termination. Consider implementing automated processes or monitoring mechanisms to identify and terminate idle clusters in a timely manner.
