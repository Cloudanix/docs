### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Redshift Cluster Nodes Should Be Of The Desired Type" for AWS using the AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the AWS console and navigate to the Amazon Redshift dashboard.
2. Select the Redshift cluster that you want to modify.
3. Click on the "Modify" button to modify the cluster.
4. In the "Node Configuration" section, select the desired node type from the dropdown menu.
5. Click on the "Apply Changes" button to apply the changes to the cluster.
6. Once the changes are applied, the Redshift cluster will be updated with the desired node type.

Note: Make sure to choose the node type that is appropriate for your workload and budget. Also, be aware that changing the node type may result in downtime for your cluster.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open your terminal and install the AWS CLI if it is not already installed by running the following command:
```
pip install awscli
```

2. Once the AWS CLI is installed, configure it with your AWS account credentials by running the following command:
```
aws configure
```

3. After configuring the AWS CLI, run the following command to describe the Redshift cluster nodes:
```
aws redshift describe-clusters --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier>
```
Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the identifier of the Redshift cluster.

4. The above command will return a JSON object with details of the Redshift cluster nodes. Check if the node types are of the desired type. If not, proceed to the next step.

5. To change the node type, run the following command:
```
aws redshift modify-cluster --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --node-type <node-type>
```
Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the identifier of the Redshift cluster and `<node-type>` with the desired node type.

6. Wait for the modification to complete. You can check the status of the modification by running the following command:
```
aws redshift describe-clusters --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --query 'Clusters[*].ClusterStatus'
```
Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the identifier of the Redshift cluster.

7. Once the modification is complete, verify that the node types are of the desired type by running the following command:
```
aws redshift describe-clusters --cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --query 'Clusters[*].NodeType'
```
Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the identifier of the Redshift cluster.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Redshift cluster nodes being of the desired type in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Redshift Cluster Nodes Should Be Of The Desired Type misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to identify the Redshift cluster that has nodes of the wrong type. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all the Redshift clusters in your account and check their node types.

```python
import boto3

redshift_client = boto3.client('redshift')
redshift_clusters = redshift_client.describe_clusters()

for cluster in redshift_clusters['Clusters']:
    if cluster['NodeType'] != 'desired_type':
        # This cluster has nodes of the wrong type
        # You can perform remediation steps here
```

2. Once you have identified the cluster(s) with the misconfiguration, you can update their node types using the `modify_cluster` method of the `boto3.client('redshift')` object.

```python
for cluster in redshift_clusters['Clusters']:
    if cluster['NodeType'] != 'desired_type':
        redshift_client.modify_cluster(
            ClusterIdentifier=cluster['ClusterIdentifier'],
            NodeType='desired_type'
        )
```

3. After you have updated the node type of the Redshift cluster, you can verify that the remediation was successful by checking the node type of the cluster again.

```python
for cluster in redshift_clusters['Clusters']:
    if cluster['NodeType'] != 'desired_type':
        redshift_client.modify_cluster(
            ClusterIdentifier=cluster['ClusterIdentifier'],
            NodeType='desired_type'
        )
        
        # Verify that the node type has been updated
        updated_cluster = redshift_client.describe_clusters(
            ClusterIdentifier=cluster['ClusterIdentifier']
        )
        
        if updated_cluster['Clusters'][0]['NodeType'] == 'desired_type':
            print(f"Redshift cluster {cluster['ClusterIdentifier']} has been remediated.")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to remediate Redshift cluster {cluster['ClusterIdentifier']}.")
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the Redshift Cluster Nodes Should Be Of The Desired Type misconfiguration in AWS using Python.
