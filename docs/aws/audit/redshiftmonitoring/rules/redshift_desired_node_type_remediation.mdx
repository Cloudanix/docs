### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Redshift cluster nodes not being of the desired type in AWS Redshift using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console and login using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to Amazon Redshift**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page, then select "Redshift" under the Analytics section.

3. **Select the Cluster**: From the list of Redshift clusters, select the cluster for which you want to modify the node type.

4. **Modify Cluster**: Click on the cluster name to open the cluster details page. In the cluster details page, click on the "Modify" button.

5. **Choose Node Type**: In the Modify Cluster page, you will see the current node type configuration. Select the desired node type from the dropdown menu under the "Node Configuration" section.

6. **Apply Changes**: After selecting the desired node type, scroll down and click on the "Apply Changes" button to save the configuration.

7. **Monitor the Modification**: AWS Redshift will start modifying the cluster with the new node type. You can monitor the progress of the modification in the cluster details page.

8. **Verification**: Once the modification is complete, verify that the cluster nodes are now of the desired type by checking the cluster details.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of Redshift cluster nodes not being of the desired type in AWS Redshift using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Redshift cluster nodes being of the desired type in AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. **Identify the current node type**: Run the following AWS CLI command to describe your Redshift cluster and note down the current node type:
   ```
   aws redshift describe-clusters --cluster-identifier YOUR_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER
   ```

2. **Choose the desired node type**: Decide on the node type that you want to use for your Redshift cluster. You can refer to the AWS documentation for available node types and their specifications.

3. **Modify the cluster with the desired node type**: Use the following AWS CLI command to modify your Redshift cluster with the desired node type:
   ```
   aws redshift modify-cluster --cluster-identifier YOUR_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER --node-type DESIRED_NODE_TYPE
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER` with the identifier of your Redshift cluster and `DESIRED_NODE_TYPE` with the node type you want to use.

4. **Monitor the modification**: You can monitor the status of the modification by running the following command:
   ```
   aws redshift describe-clusters --cluster-identifier YOUR_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER
   ```

   Check the `ClusterStatus` field in the output to see if the modification is in progress or if it has been successfully applied.

5. **Verify the node type**: Once the modification is complete, run the `describe-clusters` command again to verify that the node type of your Redshift cluster has been updated to the desired type.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Redshift cluster nodes being of the desired type in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Redshift Cluster Nodes being of the desired type in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Current Node Type**: Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to describe the Redshift cluster and retrieve information about the current node type.

2. **Define the Desired Node Type**: Determine the desired node type that you want to use for the Redshift cluster.

3. **Modify the Redshift Cluster**: Use the `modify_cluster` method from the Boto3 Redshift client to update the cluster configuration with the desired node type. Specify the new node type in the `NodeType` parameter.

4. **Wait for the Cluster Modification to Complete**: Check the status of the cluster modification using the `describe_clusters` method and wait until the modification is completed.

Here is a sample Python code snippet to remediate the misconfiguration:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the Redshift client
redshift_client = boto3.client('redshift')

# Define the cluster identifier
cluster_identifier = 'your-redshift-cluster-identifier'

# Define the desired node type
desired_node_type = 'dc2.large'

# Describe the current cluster
response = redshift_client.describe_clusters(ClusterIdentifier=cluster_identifier)
current_node_type = response['Clusters'][0]['NodeType']

# Check if the current node type is different from the desired node type
if current_node_type != desired_node_type:
    # Modify the cluster with the desired node type
    redshift_client.modify_cluster(
        ClusterIdentifier=cluster_identifier,
        NodeType=desired_node_type
    )

    # Wait for the cluster modification to complete
    waiter = redshift_client.get_waiter('cluster_modified')
    waiter.wait(ClusterIdentifier=cluster_identifier)
    
    print(f"Redshift cluster node type successfully updated to {desired_node_type}")
else:
    print(f"Redshift cluster node type is already set to {desired_node_type}")
```

Make sure to replace `'your-redshift-cluster-identifier'` with the actual identifier of your Redshift cluster and `'dc2.large'` with the desired node type that you want to use.
