How to ensure EMR instance generation is latest.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Check the Amazon EMR documentation or release notes for the latest generation of instances available. The documentation will provide details about the latest instance types, specifications, and capabilities.
2. Navigate to the Amazon EMR console.
3. Select the EMR cluster for which you want to ensure the use of the latest instance generation.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "EMR Instances Should Use Latest Generation" Policy.)
4. Click on the "Hardware" tab or the "Edit" button to view and modify the instance settings.
5. Review the current instance types configured for the cluster and compare them with the latest generation available. You can find the instance types under the "Instance Groups" section or the "Instances" tab.
6. If the cluster is not using the latest generation instances, you can modify the instance groups or individual instance configurations to use the desired instance types.
7. Select the latest generation instance types from the available options in the console. The latest generation instance types will typically have names that reflect the latest EC2 instance family.
8. Save the changes and apply them to the cluster.
