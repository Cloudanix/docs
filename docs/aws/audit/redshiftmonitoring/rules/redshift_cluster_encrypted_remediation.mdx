How to set up the new Redshift cluster, enable encryption, and move existing cluster data to it?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Amazon Redshift service by selecting "Redshift" from the services menu.
3. In the Amazon Redshift dashboard, select the cluster you want to encrypt.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Redshift Clusters Should Be Encrypted" Policy.)
4. Click on the "Cluster" dropdown menu and select "Modify".
5. In the Modify Cluster page, scroll down to the "Encryption" section.
6. Choose the encryption option that suits your requirements. You have two options:
   - AWS Managed Keys (AWS Key Management Service): Select "Enabled" and choose the appropriate AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key from the dropdown menu.
   - Customer Managed Keys (CMKs): Select "Enabled" and provide the ARN of the customer managed key you want to use.
7. Review the other configuration settings as needed and click on the "Modify Cluster" button.
8. AWS will start the modification process to enable encryption for the Redshift cluster. This process may take some time depending on the size of the cluster.
9. Once the modification is complete, your Amazon Redshift cluster will be encrypted.
