### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of "Principals with Infrastructure modification capabilities" in AWS IAMDEEPDIVE, follow these step-by-step instructions using the AWS Management Console:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using appropriate credentials.
2. Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) service.
3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Policies" and search for the policy related to the IAMDEEPDIVE user.
4. Select the policy associated with IAMDEEPDIVE and click on "Edit policy".
5. Review the policy document and identify the permissions that grant infrastructure modification capabilities.
6. Remove or modify the permissions that provide infrastructure modification capabilities. For example, if there is a permission like "ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute" or "s3:PutBucketAcl", remove or modify them accordingly.
7. Once you have made the necessary changes, click on "Review policy" to validate the updated policy.
8. Review the changes and ensure that the policy no longer grants infrastructure modification capabilities.
9. Click on "Save changes" to apply the updated policy.

By following these steps, you will successfully remediate the misconfiguration of "Principals with Infrastructure modification capabilities" for the IAMDEEPDIVE user in AWS IAM.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of "Principals with Infrastructure modification capabilities" for the AWS IAMDEEPDIVE account using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Install and configure the AWS CLI: 
   - Download and install the AWS CLI from the official AWS documentation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).
   - Run the `aws configure` command and provide the access key ID, secret access key, default region, and output format.

2. Identify the IAM user or IAM role with infrastructure modification capabilities:
   - Run the following command to list all IAM users and roles within the account:
     ```
     aws iam list-users
     aws iam list-roles
     ```
   - Review the output and identify the user or role that has infrastructure modification capabilities.

3. Remove infrastructure modification capabilities from the identified IAM user or role:
   - Run the appropriate command based on whether it is an IAM user or IAM role:
     - To remove permissions from an IAM user:
       ```
       aws iam remove-user-permissions-boundary --user-name IAM_USER_NAME
       ```
     - To remove permissions from an IAM role:
       ```
       aws iam remove-role-permissions-boundary --role-name IAM_ROLE_NAME
       ```
     Replace `IAM_USER_NAME` with the actual IAM user name and `IAM_ROLE_NAME` with the actual IAM role name.

4. Verify the removal of infrastructure modification capabilities:
   - Run the following command to verify that the permissions boundary has been removed:
     - For IAM users:
       ```
       aws iam get-user --user-name IAM_USER_NAME
       ```
     - For IAM roles:
       ```
       aws iam get-role --role-name IAM_ROLE_NAME
       ```
     Ensure that the response does not contain any reference to a permissions boundary.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of "Principals with Infrastructure modification capabilities" for the AWS IAMDEEPDIVE account using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of having principals with infrastructure modification capabilities in AWS IAMDEEPDIVE using Python, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) by running the following command in your Python environment:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries in your Python script:
   ```python
   import boto3
   ```

3. Create an AWS IAM client using the Boto3 library:
   ```python
   iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
   ```

4. Retrieve the list of IAM roles in the account:
   ```python
   response = iam_client.list_roles()
   roles = response['Roles']
   ```

5. Iterate through the list of roles and identify the roles with infrastructure modification capabilities. You can check for specific permissions or policies associated with the roles to determine if they have infrastructure modification capabilities. For example, you can check for the presence of the `AmazonEC2FullAccess` policy:
   ```python
   for role in roles:
       response = iam_client.list_attached_role_policies(RoleName=role['RoleName'])
       attached_policies = response['AttachedPolicies']
       for policy in attached_policies:
           if policy['PolicyName'] == 'AmazonEC2FullAccess':
               # Role has infrastructure modification capabilities
               # Implement your desired remediation action here
               # For example, you can remove the policy from the role
               iam_client.detach_role_policy(RoleName=role['RoleName'], PolicyArn=policy['PolicyArn'])
   ```

6. Implement your desired remediation action within the loop. For example, if you want to remove the policy from the role, use the `detach_role_policy` method as shown above. You can also modify the role's permissions, detach other policies, or take any other necessary action to remediate the misconfiguration.

7. Save the Python script and execute it to remediate the misconfiguration in AWS IAMDEEPDIVE.

Please note that these instructions are a general guideline, and you may need to modify them based on your specific requirements and the structure of your AWS environment.
