### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate inactive IAM users in AWS IAMDEEPDIVE using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and sign in to your AWS account.
2. Go to the IAM service by searching for "IAM" in the search bar or locating it under the "Security, Identity & Compliance" category.
3. In the IAM console, click on "Users" from the left-hand menu.
4. Review the list of IAM users and identify the inactive users. Inactive users are those who have not accessed any AWS resources recently.
5. Select the inactive user(s) by clicking the checkbox next to their name.
6. Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Manage access keys" from the options.
7. In the "Manage Access Keys" dialog box, click on the "Delete Access Key" button to remove any access keys associated with the inactive user(s).
8. Confirm the deletion by clicking "Yes, Delete" in the confirmation prompt.
9. After deleting the access keys, the user(s) will no longer be able to access AWS resources using those keys.
10. To further ensure the user(s) cannot access AWS resources, click on the "Security credentials" tab for each inactive user.
11. In the "Security credentials" tab, click on the "Make inactive" link next to the access key(s) that are still active.
12. Confirm the action by clicking "Yes, Make inactive" in the confirmation prompt.
13. Once the access keys are deleted and made inactive, the user(s) will have no active credentials to access AWS resources.
14. Repeat these steps for all identified inactive users.
15. Regularly review the IAM user list to identify and remediate any newly inactive users.

By following these steps, you can remediate inactive IAM users in AWS IAMDEEPDIVE using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of inactive IAM users in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS CLI:

1. List all the IAM users in the AWS account:
   ```
   aws iam list-users
   ```

2. Identify the inactive users by looking at the "LastUsedDate" attribute. If the "LastUsedDate" is empty or older than the desired threshold, consider the user as inactive.

3. Disable the inactive IAM users using the `update-login-profile` command:
   ```
   aws iam update-login-profile --user-name <USER_NAME> --no-password-reset-required
   ```
   Replace `<USER_NAME>` with the username of the inactive user.

   This command disables the user's login profile, preventing them from accessing the AWS Management Console or making API calls.

4. Optionally, you can also delete the access keys associated with the inactive user to further secure the account:
   ```
   aws iam delete-access-key --user-name <USER_NAME> --access-key-id <ACCESS_KEY_ID>
   ```
   Replace `<USER_NAME>` with the username of the inactive user and `<ACCESS_KEY_ID>` with the access key ID.

   Repeat this command for each access key associated with the inactive user.

5. Review the list of inactive users again to ensure they have been disabled:
   ```
   aws iam list-users
   ```

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for any remaining inactive users until all of them have been disabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of inactive IAM users in AWS IAMDEEPDIVE using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate inactive IAM users in AWS, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to identify and delete the inactive users. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this issue:

1. Install the Boto3 library:
   
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials:
   
   Set up your AWS credentials by either using AWS CLI (`aws configure`) or setting environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`).

3. Import the required libraries:
   
   ```python
   import boto3
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta
   ```

4. Define a function to check user activity:
   
   ```python
   def is_user_inactive(user):
       # Get the user's last activity date
       last_activity = user.password_last_used

       # Calculate the inactive duration (e.g., 90 days)
       inactive_duration = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=90)

       # Check if the user is inactive
       if last_activity is None or last_activity < inactive_duration:
           return True
       return False
   ```

5. Connect to AWS IAM service:
   
   ```python
   iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
   ```

6. Retrieve all IAM users:
   
   ```python
   response = iam_client.list_users()
   users = response['Users']
   ```

7. Identify and delete inactive users:
   
   ```python
   for user in users:
       if is_user_inactive(user):
           # Delete the inactive user
           iam_client.delete_user(UserName=user['UserName'])
           print(f"Deleted inactive user: {user['UserName']}")
   ```

8. Run the script to remediate the issue:
   
   ```bash
   python remediate_inactive_users.py
   ```

Note: Make sure you have appropriate permissions to delete IAM users. It is recommended to test the script in a non-production environment before running it in a production environment.
