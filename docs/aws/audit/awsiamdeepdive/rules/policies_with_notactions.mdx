#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of policies with NotAction in the statements for AWS IAMDEEPDIVE using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console in your web browser and sign in to your AWS account.

2. Navigate to the IAM service by searching for "IAM" in the AWS services search bar and selecting "IAM - Identity and Access Management."

3. In the IAM console, click on "Policies" in the left-hand navigation menu.

4. Search for the policy named "IAMDEEPDIVE" in the list of policies and select it.

5. In the policy details page, you will see the JSON representation of the policy. Look for any statements that have "NotAction" defined.

6. To remediate this misconfiguration, you have two options:

   a. Remove the "NotAction" condition: If the "NotAction" condition is not necessary, you can simply remove it from the statement. To do this, locate the statement with the "NotAction" condition and remove the entire "NotAction" key-value pair from the JSON.

   b. Replace "NotAction" with "Action": If the "NotAction" condition is required but has been misconfigured, you can replace it with the correct "Action" condition. To do this, locate the statement with the "NotAction" condition and replace "NotAction" with "Action" in the JSON.

7. After making the necessary changes, click on the "Review policy" button at the top of the page to validate the JSON syntax and ensure there are no errors.

8. Once the policy passes the review, click on the "Save changes" button to save the remediated policy.

By following these steps, you will have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of policies with "NotAction" in the statements for the AWS IAMDEEPDIVE policy using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of policies with NotAction in the statements for AWS IAMDEEPDIVE, you can follow these steps using the AWS CLI:

1. Identify the policies that contain NotAction in their statements. You can use the following command to list all the policies in your AWS account:
   ```
   aws iam list-policies
   ```

2. For each policy that contains NotAction, you need to update the policy document to remove the NotAction statement. Retrieve the policy document using the following command:
   ```
   aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <policy_arn> --version-id <version_id>
   ```

   Replace `<policy_arn>` with the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the policy and `<version_id>` with the version ID of the policy document.

3. Once you have the policy document, update it to remove the NotAction statement. You can use a text editor to modify the policy document and remove the lines that contain "NotAction". Save the modified policy document.

4. Create a new version of the policy with the updated document using the following command:
   ```
   aws iam create-policy-version --policy-arn <policy_arn> --policy-document file://<path_to_modified_policy_document> --set-as-default
   ```

   Replace `<policy_arn>` with the ARN of the policy and `<path_to_modified_policy_document>` with the local file path to the modified policy document.

5. Once the new policy version is created and set as the default, you can delete the old version(s) of the policy using the following command:
   ```
   aws iam delete-policy-version --policy-arn <policy_arn> --version-id <version_id>
   ```

   Replace `<policy_arn>` with the ARN of the policy and `<version_id>` with the version ID of the old policy document you want to delete.

6. Repeat steps 2-5 for each policy that contains NotAction in its statements.

By following these steps, you will remediate the misconfiguration of policies with NotAction in the statements for AWS IAMDEEPDIVE using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of policies with NotAction in the statements in AWS IAM, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. Identify the policies with NotAction statements: You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all the IAM policies in the AWS account.

```python
import boto3

# Create an IAM client
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

# List all IAM policies
response = iam_client.list_policies()

# Iterate through the policies and check for NotAction statements
for policy in response['Policies']:
    policy_arn = policy['Arn']
    policy_version = iam_client.get_policy_version(
        PolicyArn=policy_arn,
        VersionId=policy['DefaultVersionId']
    )

    # Check for NotAction statements in the policy version document
    policy_document = policy_version['PolicyVersion']['Document']
    if 'NotAction' in policy_document['Statement']:
        print(f"Policy {policy_arn} has NotAction statements.")
```

2. Update policies to remove NotAction statements: Once you have identified the policies with NotAction statements, you can update them to remove those statements. You will need to create a new policy version with the updated policy document.

```python
# Create a new policy version without NotAction statements
updated_policy_document = policy_document.copy()
for statement in updated_policy_document['Statement']:
    if 'NotAction' in statement:
        del statement['NotAction']

# Create a new policy version
response = iam_client.create_policy_version(
    PolicyArn=policy_arn,
    PolicyDocument=json.dumps(updated_policy_document),
    SetAsDefault=True
)

# Activate the new policy version
response = iam_client.set_default_policy_version(
    PolicyArn=policy_arn,
    VersionId=response['PolicyVersion']['VersionId']
)
```

3. Validate the updated policies: After updating the policies, it's recommended to validate them to ensure that they are working as expected. You can do this by testing the policies against specific actions to verify their behavior.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to perform these actions in the AWS account.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of policies with NotAction in the statements in AWS IAM using Python and Boto3.
