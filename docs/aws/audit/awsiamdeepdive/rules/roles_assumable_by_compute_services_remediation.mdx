### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of roles assumable by Compute services in AWS IAMDEEPDIVE, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using appropriate credentials.
2. Open the IAM service from the console.
3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Roles".
4. Search for the "IAMDEEPDIVE" role and click on it to view its details.
5. In the "Trust relationships" tab, click on the "Edit trust relationship" button.
6. Modify the trust policy document to include only the necessary compute services that should assume this role. For example, for EC2 instances, the trust policy should contain the "ec2.amazonaws.com" service principal.
7. Remove any other unnecessary services from the trust policy document.
8. Ensure that the trust policy document follows the principle of least privilege, granting access only to the required compute services.
9. Once the trust policy is modified, click on the "Update Trust Policy" button to save the changes.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of roles assumable by Compute services for the AWS IAMDEEPDIVE role.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of roles assumable by Compute services for the AWS IAMDEEPDIVE account using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the current roles that are assumable by Compute services:
   - Open the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console.
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to list all the roles in the account:
     ```
     aws iam list-roles
     ```
   - Review the output and identify the roles that are assumable by Compute services (e.g., EC2, Lambda, ECS, etc.).

2. Determine the correct policies for roles assumable by Compute services:
   - Refer to the AWS documentation or security best practices to identify the recommended policies for Compute service roles.
   - Ensure that the policies provide the least privilege necessary for the services to function properly.

3. Update the roles' trust policies:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to update the trust policy for each role assumable by Compute services:
     ```
     aws iam update-assume-role-policy --role-name <role-name> --policy-document file://trust-policy.json
     ```
     Replace `<role-name>` with the name of the role you want to update.
     Replace `trust-policy.json` with the file path containing the updated trust policy in JSON format.

4. Validate the updated roles:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to verify that the roles' trust policies have been updated successfully:
     ```
     aws iam get-role --role-name <role-name>
     ```
     Replace `<role-name>` with the name of the role you updated.
   - Review the output to ensure that the trust policy reflects the changes you made.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all roles assumable by Compute services.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of roles assumable by Compute services for the AWS IAMDEEPDIVE account using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of roles assumable by Compute services in AWS IAMDEEPDIVE using Python, follow these steps:

1. Identify the misconfiguration: Determine which roles are assumable by Compute services in AWS IAMDEEPDIVE. 

2. Review the existing IAM roles: Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to retrieve the list of IAM roles in the AWS account associated with IAMDEEPDIVE. You can use the `list_roles` method from the `iam` client to get the roles.

3. Filter roles assumable by Compute services: Iterate through the list of roles and check the `AssumeRolePolicyDocument` for each role. Identify the roles that allow Compute services (such as EC2, Lambda, or ECS) to assume them. 

4. Modify the AssumeRolePolicyDocument: For each role identified in the previous step, update the `AssumeRolePolicyDocument` to restrict the trusted entities that can assume the role. You can use the `update_assume_role_policy` method from the `iam` client to modify the policy document. 

   Note: Make sure to review and understand the existing policy document before modifying it. Ensure that you do not accidentally remove necessary permissions.

5. Implement the remediation code: Write a Python script using Boto3 to perform the above steps. Here's an example:

```python
import boto3

def remediate_compute_service_assumable_roles():
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
    
    # Step 2: List IAM roles
    response = iam_client.list_roles()
    roles = response['Roles']
    
    for role in roles:
        role_name = role['RoleName']
        
        # Step 3: Filter roles assumable by Compute services
        assume_role_policy = role['AssumeRolePolicyDocument']
        if is_compute_service_assumable(assume_role_policy):
            # Step 4: Modify the AssumeRolePolicyDocument
            updated_policy = modify_assume_role_policy(assume_role_policy)
            
            # Update the AssumeRolePolicyDocument for the role
            iam_client.update_assume_role_policy(
                RoleName=role_name,
                PolicyDocument=updated_policy
            )
            
            print(f"AssumeRolePolicyDocument updated for role: {role_name}")

def is_compute_service_assumable(assume_role_policy):
    # Implement your logic to determine if Compute services can assume the role
    # For example, check if the policy document allows EC2, Lambda, or ECS to assume the role
    # Return True if assumable by Compute services, False otherwise
    pass

def modify_assume_role_policy(assume_role_policy):
    # Implement your logic to modify the AssumeRolePolicyDocument
    # Update the policy document to restrict trusted entities that can assume the role
    # Return the updated AssumeRolePolicyDocument
    pass

# Run the remediation function
remediate_compute_service_assumable_roles()
```

6. Test the script: Execute the Python script to remediate the misconfiguration. Verify that the roles assumable by Compute services have been updated successfully.

Note: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify IAM roles and policies in the AWS account associated with IAMDEEPDIVE.
