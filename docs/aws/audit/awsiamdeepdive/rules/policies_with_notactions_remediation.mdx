1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) service.

2. In the IAM dashboard, click on "Policies" in the left navigation pane. This will display a list of all the IAM policies in your AWS account.

3. Click on the policy name that you want to check. This will open the policy details page.

4. In the policy details page, look at the "Policy Document" section. This section displays the JSON representation of the policy. Check if there are any statements with "NotAction" in them. If there are, it means that the policy allows all actions except the ones specified in the "NotAction" statement. This could potentially lead to overly permissive policies if not properly managed.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Once you have AWS CLI installed and configured, you can proceed to the next steps.

2. To list all the IAM policies, use the following command:
   ```
   aws iam list-policies
   ```
   This command will return a JSON object that contains all the IAM policies.

3. To get the details of each policy, you can use the following command:
   ```
   aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <PolicyArn> --version-id <VersionId>
   ```
   Replace `<PolicyArn>` and `<VersionId>` with the ARN and version ID of the policy you want to check. This command will return a JSON object that contains the details of the policy.

4. To check if a policy has `NotAction` in the statements, you can parse the JSON object returned by the previous command. You can do this manually or by using a tool like `jq`. Here is an example of how to do it with `jq`:
   ```
   aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <PolicyArn> --version-id <VersionId> | jq '.PolicyVersion.Document.Statement[] | select(.NotAction)'
   ```
   This command will return the statements that contain `NotAction`. If it doesn't return anything, it means that the policy doesn't have `NotAction` in the statements.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, configure your AWS credentials. You can configure credentials by using the AWS CLI:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   It will prompt you for your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format. Enter the details accordingly.

2. **Create a Python Script to List IAM Policies:**
   Now, create a Python script that uses Boto3 to list all IAM policies. Here's a simple script that does this:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # List policies
   response = iam.list_policies(Scope='All')
   for policy in response['Policies']:
       print(policy['Arn'])
   ```
   This script will print the ARN of all policies.

3. **Get Policy Details and Check for NotAction in Statements:**
   Modify the script to get the details of each policy and check if there is a 'NotAction' in the policy statements. Here's how you can do this:
   ```python
   import boto3
   import json

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # List policies
   response = iam.list_policies(Scope='All')
   for policy in response['Policies']:
       policy_version = iam.get_policy_version(
           PolicyArn=policy['Arn'],
           VersionId=policy['DefaultVersionId']
       )
       document = json.loads(policy_version['PolicyVersion']['Document'])
       for statement in document['Statement']:
           if 'NotAction' in statement:
               print(f"Policy {policy['Arn']} contains 'NotAction' in its statements.")
   ```
   This script will print the ARN of policies that contain 'NotAction' in their statements.

4. **Run the Python Script:**
   Finally, run the Python script. If there are any policies with 'NotAction' in their statements, their ARNs will be printed. If no such policies are found, nothing will be printed.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of policies with NotAction in the statements in AWS IAM, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the IAM console.
3. In the navigation pane, click on "Policies".
4. Search for the policy that contains the "NotAction" statement.
5. Select the policy by clicking on its name.
6. In the policy summary page, click on the "Edit policy" button.
7. In the policy editor, locate the statement with the "NotAction" condition that needs to be remediated.
8. Remove the "NotAction" condition from the statement.
9. Review the remaining conditions and ensure they are correct and aligned with your intended permissions.
10. Click on the "Review policy" button to validate the changes.
11. Review the policy summary page to verify that there are no errors or warnings.
12. Click on the "Save changes" button to apply the remediation.

Once the policy is saved, the misconfiguration of having "NotAction" in the statements will be resolved. It is recommended to thoroughly review the policy to ensure that the desired permissions are correctly defined and that the policy aligns with your security requirements.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of policies with NotAction in the statements in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the policies that contain NotAction in their statements. You can use the AWS CLI command `list-policies` to list all the policies in your AWS account.

   ```bash
   aws iam list-policies
   ```

   Note down the ARN or name of the policies that have NotAction in their statements.

2. Retrieve the policy document for each identified policy using the AWS CLI command `get-policy-version`. Replace `<policy-arn>` with the ARN of the policy you want to retrieve.

   ```bash
   aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <policy-arn> --version-id v1
   ```

   Note down the `Document` field value from the command output, as it contains the policy document.

3. Edit the policy document to remove the NotAction statement. You can use a text editor or a JSON editor to modify the policy document. Remove the `NotAction` field from each statement that contains it.

   For example, if the policy document looks like this:

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "s3:*",
               "NotAction": "s3:GetObject",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   Modify it to remove the `NotAction` field:

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "s3:*",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

4. Once you have edited the policy document, save the changes.

5. Update the policy with the modified policy document using the AWS CLI command `create-policy-version`. Replace `<policy-arn>` with the ARN of the policy you want to update, and `<modified-policy-document>` with the path to the modified policy document JSON file.

   ```bash
   aws iam create-policy-version --policy-arn <policy-arn> --policy-document file://<modified-policy-document> --set-as-default
   ```

   This command creates a new version of the policy with the modified policy document and sets it as the default version.

6. Verify that the policy has been updated by checking the policy version using the AWS CLI command `get-policy-version`. Replace `<policy-arn>` with the ARN of the policy you updated.

   ```bash
   aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <policy-arn> --version-id v2
   ```

   Ensure that the `Document` field in the output matches the modified policy document.

7. Repeat steps 3-6 for each policy identified in step 1 that contains NotAction in its statements.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of policies with NotAction in the statements in AWS IAM using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of policies with NotAction in the statements in AWS IAM using Python, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   - Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using the command: `pip install boto3`

2. Configure your AWS credentials:
   - Open the AWS Management Console and go to the IAM service.
   - Create an IAM user with the necessary permissions to modify IAM policies.
   - Generate an access key and secret access key for the IAM user.
   - Configure your AWS credentials by running the command: `aws configure` and provide the access key, secret access key, and region.

3. Write a Python script to remediate the misconfigured policies. Below is an example script:

```python
import boto3

def remediate_policies():
    # Create an IAM client
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

    # List all the policies in IAM
    response = iam_client.list_policies()

    # Iterate through each policy
    for policy in response['Policies']:
        # Get the policy details
        policy_arn = policy['Arn']
        policy_version = iam_client.get_policy(PolicyArn=policy_arn)['Policy']['DefaultVersionId']
        policy_document = iam_client.get_policy_version(PolicyArn=policy_arn, VersionId=policy_version)['PolicyVersion']['Document']

        # Check if the policy contains a NotAction statement
        if 'NotAction' in policy_document['Statement']:
            # Remove the NotAction statement from the policy
            policy_document['Statement'].pop('NotAction')

            # Update the policy with the modified document
            iam_client.create_policy_version(
                PolicyArn=policy_arn,
                PolicyDocument=policy_document,
                SetAsDefault=True
            )

            print(f"Policy {policy_arn} has been remediated.")

remediate_policies()
```

4. Run the Python script:
   - Save the script in a file, for example, `remediate_policies.py`.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
   - Run the command: `python remediate_policies.py`.

The script will iterate through all the policies in your AWS account and remove the NotAction statement from any policies that contain it. The modified policies will be updated with the new version, replacing the old version.
