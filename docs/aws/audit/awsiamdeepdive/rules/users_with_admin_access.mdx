### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of having users with Administrator Access in AWS IAMDEEPDIVE, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using the root account or an IAM user with administrative privileges.

2. Open the AWS IAM console by searching for "IAM" in the AWS Management Console search bar and selecting "IAM" under "Services".

3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Users".

4. Search for the user "IAMDEEPDIVE" in the list of users and select it.

5. Click on the "Permissions" tab.

6. Under the "Inline Policies" section, click on the "Create inline policy" button.

7. In the "Create Policy" wizard, select the "JSON" tab.

8. Replace the existing policy with the following JSON policy document:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iam:List*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This policy allows the user to only list IAM resources and does not grant Administrator Access.

9. Click on the "Review policy" button.

10. Provide a name for the policy, such as "IAMDEEPDIVE-LimitedAccess", and add an optional description.

11. Review the policy summary and click on the "Create policy" button.

12. Once the policy is created, go back to the "Permissions" tab of the user IAMDEEPDIVE.

13. Click on the "Attach policy" button.

14. In the search bar, type the name of the policy you created in step 10 ("IAMDEEPDIVE-LimitedAccess").

15. Select the policy from the list and click on the "Attach policy" button.

16. Verify that the policy is attached to the user by checking the "Attached permissions policies" section.

17. Now, the user IAMDEEPDIVE will no longer have Administrator Access but will only be able to list IAM resources.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of having users with Administrator Access in AWS IAMDEEPDIVE. The user will now have limited access to IAM resources.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of having users with Administrator Access in AWS IAMDEEPDIVE using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the users in the IAMDEEPDIVE account:
   ```
   aws iam list-users --profile IAMDEEPDIVE
   ```

3. Identify the user(s) with Administrator Access privileges that need to be remediated.

4. Create a new IAM policy that restricts the user's permissions to only the necessary actions. For example, you can create a policy that provides read-only access to specific resources.

   a. Create a JSON file (e.g., `restricted-policy.json`) with the desired policy content. Here's an example of a policy that allows read-only access to EC2 resources:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "ec2:Describe*",
           "ec2:Get*"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   b. Run the following command to create the new IAM policy:
   ```
   aws iam create-policy --policy-name RestrictedPolicy --policy-document file://restricted-policy.json --profile IAMDEEPDIVE
   ```

5. Attach the newly created policy to the user(s) with Administrator Access. Replace `<USER-NAME>` with the actual username.

   ```
   aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <USER-NAME> --policy-arn <POLICY-ARN> --profile IAMDEEPDIVE
   ```

   Note: `<POLICY-ARN>` refers to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy created in the previous step. You can retrieve it from the output of the `create-policy` command or by listing the policies using `aws iam list-policies --profile IAMDEEPDIVE`.

6. Verify that the user(s) now have the restricted policy attached and no longer have Administrator Access.

   ```
   aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name <USER-NAME> --profile IAMDEEPDIVE
   ```

   Ensure that the restricted policy is listed, and the Administrator Access policy (e.g., `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess`) is not present.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 for each user with Administrator Access privileges that needs to be remediated.

By following these steps, you can restrict the permissions of users with Administrator Access in the AWS IAMDEEPDIVE account, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions and potential security breaches.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of having users with Administrator Access in AWS IAMDEEPDIVE using Python, follow these steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) by running the following command in your Python environment:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure your AWS credentials by creating a `~/.aws/credentials` file or setting the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with the appropriate values.

3. Open a Python script and import the necessary libraries:
   ```python
   import boto3
   ```

4. Initialize the IAM client:
   ```python
   iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
   ```

5. Retrieve the list of users with Administrator Access:
   ```python
   response = iam_client.list_users()
   admin_users = []

   for user in response['Users']:
       response = iam_client.list_attached_user_policies(UserName=user['UserName'])
       for policy in response['AttachedPolicies']:
           if policy['PolicyName'] == 'AdministratorAccess':
               admin_users.append(user['UserName'])
   ```

6. Remove Administrator Access from the identified users:
   ```python
   for user in admin_users:
       response = iam_client.detach_user_policy(
           UserName=user,
           PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess'
       )
   ```

7. Verify the remediation by re-running step 5 to check if the users still have Administrator Access.

Note: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform IAM operations.
