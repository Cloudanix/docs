How to enable origin access identity for Cloudfront CDN distribution and restrict the user access to the S3 bucket?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Create an Origin Access Identity:
   - Go to the CloudFront console and navigate to the "Origin Access Identity" section.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Origin Access Identity Should Be Enabled For CloudFront Distributions" Policy.)
   - Click on "Create Origin Access Identity" and provide a name for the identity.
   - Ensure that the "Grant CloudFront access to my Amazon S3 bucket" option is selected.
2. Update S3 Bucket Permissions:
   - Go to the S3 console and select the bucket associated with your CloudFront distribution.
   - Click on the "Permissions" tab and then choose "Bucket Policy".
   - Add a bucket policy that allows access only from your CloudFront distribution's OAI.
   - Use the following example policy, replacing `your-cloudfront-oai-id` and `your-bucket-name` with the actual values:
     ```
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Id": "CloudFront-OAI-Access-Policy",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Sid": "CloudFront-OAI-Allow-S3-Access",
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": {
             "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/CloudFront Origin Access Identity/your-cloudfront-oai-id"
           },
           "Action": "s3:GetObject",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
3. Update CloudFront Distribution:
   - Go back to the CloudFront console and select your distribution.
   - Click on the "Behaviors" tab and choose the behavior that corresponds to the S3 bucket you want to restrict.
   - In the "Origin Settings" section, select the S3 origin and choose the appropriate S3 bucket from the dropdown.
   - In the "Restrict Bucket Access" section, select "Yes" for "Restrict Viewer Access" and choose the OAI you created.
   - Save your changes.
