How to enable HTTPS for CloudFront for secure delivery of web content?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate:
   - Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA) or use an ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) certificate. Make sure the certificate is valid for the domain(s) you intend to use with CloudFront.
2. Upload the SSL/TLS certificate to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) (if applicable):
   - If you are using an ACM certificate, upload the certificate to ACM in the AWS Management Console.
3. Open the CloudFront console:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the CloudFront service.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "CloudFront Distributions Should Use HTTPS For Secure Delivery of Web Content" Policy.)
4. Create a new CloudFront distribution or select an existing one:
   - Click on the "Create Distribution" button to create a new CloudFront distribution, or select the existing distribution you want to enable HTTPS for.
5. Configure the distribution settings:
   - In the distribution settings, specify the origin server(s) that CloudFront will pull content from.
   - Configure other settings like cache behavior, TTLs, etc., as per your requirements.
6. Configure the SSL/TLS certificate:
   - In the "SSL Certificate" section, choose "Custom SSL Certificate".
   - Select the ACM certificate or the custom SSL/TLS certificate you uploaded to ACM.
7. Specify HTTPS settings:
   - In the "Viewer Protocol Policy" option, select "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" or "HTTPS Only" depending on your requirements.
   - Choose the appropriate option to enforce HTTPS for all client requests.
8. Save the changes and wait for the distribution to deploy:
   - Click on the "Create Distribution" or "Update Distribution" button to save the changes.
   - Wait for the distribution to deploy, which may take some time.
