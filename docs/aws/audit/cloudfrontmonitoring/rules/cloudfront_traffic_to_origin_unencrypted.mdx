<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/.

2. In the CloudFront console, in the top navigation pane, click on "Distributions".

3. In the Distributions pane, select the distribution that you want to check.

4. In the distribution settings, click on the "Behaviors" tab. Here, you can see all the behaviors associated with the selected distribution.

5. Check the "Viewer Protocol Policy" for each behavior. If the Viewer Protocol Policy is set to "HTTP and HTTPS" or "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS", then the CloudFront distribution is using HTTPS for secure delivery of web content. If it is set to "HTTP Only", then it is a misconfiguration as it is not using HTTPS for secure delivery of web content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all CloudFront distributions: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws cloudfront list-distributions --query 'DistributionList.Items[*].{ID:Id,Domain:DomainName,Origins:Origins.Items[*].{ID:Id,Domain:DomainName}}'
   ```
   This command will return a list of all CloudFront distributions along with their ID, domain name, and origin details.

3. Check the Viewer Protocol Policy: For each CloudFront distribution, check the Viewer Protocol Policy to see if it's set to HTTPS. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id <distribution-id> --query 'DistributionConfig.DefaultCacheBehavior.ViewerProtocolPolicy'
   ```
   Replace `<distribution-id>` with the ID of the CloudFront distribution you want to check. This command will return the Viewer Protocol Policy of the specified CloudFront distribution.

4. Analyze the output: If the Viewer Protocol Policy is set to `https-only` or `redirect-to-https`, then the CloudFront distribution is using HTTPS for secure delivery of web content. If it's set to `allow-all`, then the CloudFront distribution is not using HTTPS for secure delivery of web content, which is a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS services. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure it using AWS CLI:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, which you can get from your AWS Management Console.

2. Import necessary libraries and create a CloudFront client:
   In your Python script, you need to import Boto3 and create a CloudFront client to interact with the service.
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create CloudFront client
   cf = boto3.client('cloudfront')
   ```

3. List and check CloudFront distributions:
   Use the `list_distributions()` function to get a list of all your CloudFront distributions. Then, iterate over each distribution and check if the ViewerProtocolPolicy is set to 'https-only' or 'redirect-to-https'. If not, the distribution is misconfigured.
   ```python
   # List distributions
   distributions = cf.list_distributions()

   for distribution in distributions['DistributionList']['Items']:
       # Get the default cache behavior
       default_behavior = distribution['DefaultCacheBehavior']

       # Check the ViewerProtocolPolicy
       if default_behavior['ViewerProtocolPolicy'] not in ['https-only', 'redirect-to-https']:
           print(f"Distribution {distribution['Id']} is misconfigured.")
   ```

4. Run the script:
   Save your script and run it using Python. It will print the IDs of all misconfigured CloudFront distributions.
   ```
   python check_cloudfront.py
   ```
   If there are any misconfigured distributions, you should see their IDs printed in the console.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "CloudFront Distributions Should Use HTTPS For Secure Delivery of Web Content" in AWS using the AWS Console:

1. Login to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the CloudFront console.
3. Select the distribution(s) that you want to modify.
4. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
5. In the "General" tab, under the "Viewer Protocol Policy" section, select "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS".
6. Click on the "Yes, Edit" button to save the changes.
7. Wait for the changes to propagate.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudFront Distributions Should Use HTTPS For Secure Delivery of Web Content" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Login to your AWS account using AWS CLI.
2. Identify the CloudFront distributions that are not using HTTPS for secure delivery of web content. You can use the following command to list all the CloudFront distributions in your account:

   ```
   aws cloudfront list-distributions
   ```

3. Once you have identified the CloudFront distribution that is not using HTTPS, you can update it to use HTTPS by using the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudfront update-distribution --id <distribution_id> --distribution-config file://config.json
   ```

   Replace `<distribution_id>` with the ID of the CloudFront distribution that you want to update.

4. Create a JSON file named `config.json` and add the following code to it:

   ```
   {
       "Comment": "Update CloudFront distribution to use HTTPS",
       "Enabled": true,
       "ViewerCertificate": {

   }
   ```

   Replace `<ACM_certificate_ARN>` with the ARN of the ACM certificate that you want to use for HTTPS. Replace `<origin_id>` with the ID of the CloudFront origin that you want to use for HTTPS. Replace `<origin_domain_name>` with the domain name of the CloudFront origin that you want to use for HTTPS.

5. Save the `config.json` file and run the `aws cloudfront update-distribution` command to update the CloudFront distribution to use HTTPS.

6. Verify that the CloudFront distribution is now using HTTPS by accessing the distribution's URL in a web browser. The URL should start with `https://`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of CloudFront distributions not using HTTPS for secure delivery of web content, you can use the following Python script:

1. First, import the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) libraries:

```
import boto3
```

2. Next, create a Boto3 client for CloudFront:

```
cloudfront = boto3.client('cloudfront')
```

3. Then, use the `list_distributions()` method to get a list of all CloudFront distributions:

```
response = cloudfront.list_distributions()
```

4. Loop through the distributions and check if they are using HTTPS:

```
for distribution in response['DistributionList']['Items']:
    if distribution['ViewerCertificate']['CertificateSource'] != 'cloudfront':
        print("Distribution {} is not using a CloudFront SSL certificate".format(distribution['Id']))
    elif distribution['ViewerCertificate']['MinimumProtocolVersion'] != 'TLSv1.2_2018':
        print("Distribution {} is not using TLSv1.2_2018".format(distribution['Id']))
    elif distribution['ViewerCertificate']['SSLSupportMethod'] != 'sni-only':
        print("Distribution {} is not using SNI-only SSL".format(distribution['Id']))
    else:
        print("Distribution {} is using HTTPS".format(distribution['Id']))
```

5. If a distribution is not using HTTPS, update its configuration using the `update_distribution()` method:

```
distribution_id = 'YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID'

response = cloudfront.get_distribution_config(Id=distribution_id)
config = response['DistributionConfig']

config['ViewerCertificate']['CloudFrontDefaultCertificate'] = True
config['ViewerCertificate']['MinimumProtocolVersion'] = 'TLSv1.2_2018'
config['ViewerCertificate']['SSLSupportMethod'] = 'sni-only'

response = cloudfront.update_distribution(DistributionConfig=config, Id=distribution_id, IfMatch=response['ETag'])

print("Distribution {} has been updated to use HTTPS".format(distribution_id))
```

Note: Replace `YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID` with the ID of the distribution you want to update.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of CloudFront distributions not using HTTPS for secure delivery of web content in AWS using Python.
