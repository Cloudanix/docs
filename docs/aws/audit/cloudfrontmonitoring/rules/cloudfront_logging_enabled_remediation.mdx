<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To ensure that logging is enabled for CloudFront distributions using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **List CloudFront Distributions**:
   First, identify the CloudFront distribution for which you want to enable logging.
   ```sh
   aws cloudfront list-distributions
   ```

2. **Get Distribution Configuration**:
   Retrieve the current configuration of the specific CloudFront distribution. Replace `<DISTRIBUTION_ID>` with your actual distribution ID.
   ```sh
   aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id <DISTRIBUTION_ID>
   ```

3. **Update Distribution Configuration**:
   Modify the configuration to enable logging. You will need to create a JSON file (e.g., `distribution-config.json`) with the updated configuration. Ensure the `Logging` section is properly configured:
   ```json
   {
     "DistributionConfig": {
       "Logging": {
         "Enabled": true,
         "IncludeCookies": false,
         "Bucket": "my-logs-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com",
         "Prefix": "my-log-prefix/"
       },
       ...
     },
     "IfMatch": "<ETAG>"
   }
   ```
   Replace `<ETAG>` with the ETag value obtained from the previous step.

4. **Apply the Updated Configuration**:
   Use the updated JSON configuration file to update the CloudFront distribution.
   ```sh
   aws cloudfront update-distribution --id <DISTRIBUTION_ID> --distribution-config file://distribution-config.json
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that logging is enabled for your CloudFront distributions using the AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of not having logging enabled for CloudFront distributions using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps to ensure logging is enabled for CloudFront distributions:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**:
   Initialize the Boto3 client for CloudFront.
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('cloudfront')
   ```

3. **List CloudFront Distributions**:
   Retrieve the list of CloudFront distributions.
   ```python
   distributions = client.list_distributions()
   ```

4. **Enable Logging for Each Distribution**:
   Iterate through each distribution and ensure logging is enabled.
   ```python
   for distribution in distributions['DistributionList']['Items']:
       distribution_id = distribution['Id']
       distribution_config = client.get_distribution_config(Id=distribution_id)
       config = distribution_config['DistributionConfig']
       
       # Check if logging is enabled
       if not config['Logging']['Enabled']:
           # Enable logging
           config['Logging']['Enabled'] = True
           config['Logging']['Bucket'] = 'your-logging-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com'
           config['Logging']['Prefix'] = 'your-log-prefix/'

           # Update the distribution with the new config
           client.update_distribution(
               DistributionConfig=config,
               Id=distribution_id,
               IfMatch=distribution_config['ETag']
           )
           print(f"Enabled logging for distribution: {distribution_id}")
       else:
           print(f"Logging already enabled for distribution: {distribution_id}")
   ```

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Install Boto3**: Ensure Boto3 is installed.
2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**: Set up the CloudFront client.
3. **List CloudFront Distributions**: Retrieve all distributions.
4. **Enable Logging for Each Distribution**: Check and enable logging for each distribution if not already enabled.

This script will ensure that logging is enabled for all your CloudFront distributions, helping you prevent the misconfiguration.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the CloudFront service by typing 'CloudFront' in the search bar and selecting it from the dropdown menu.
3. In the CloudFront dashboard, you will see a list of all your CloudFront distributions. Click on the ID of the distribution you want to check.
4. In the distribution settings, click on the 'Logs' tab. Here, you can see whether logging is enabled or not. If the 'Enable Logging' checkbox is not checked, then logging is not enabled for this CloudFront distribution.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all CloudFront distributions: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws cloudfront list-distributions --query 'DistributionList.Items[*].Id' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of IDs of all the CloudFront distributions.

3. Check logging configuration for each distribution: For each distribution ID returned by the previous command, run the following command to get the logging configuration:

   ```
   aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id <distribution-id>
   ```
   Replace `<distribution-id>` with the actual ID of the distribution. This command will return the configuration of the specified CloudFront distribution.

4. Check if logging is enabled: In the output of the previous command, look for the `Logging` field under `DistributionConfig`. If the `Enabled` field under `Logging` is `false`, then logging is not enabled for that CloudFront distribution. If the `Bucket` field under `Logging` is empty, then no bucket is specified for storing the logs. Both these cases indicate a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if logging is enabled for CloudFront Distributions using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the Boto3 library in Python:**
   Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set up AWS Credentials and Region for Development:**
   Before you can begin using Boto3, you should set up authentication credentials. You can do this by creating a new IAM user in your AWS account and then set your AWS credentials in the AWS credentials file, which is located by default at `~/.aws/credentials`. At a minimum, the credentials file should specify the access key and secret access key. To specify these for the `default` profile, you can use the following format:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. **Create a Python script to check if logging is enabled for CloudFront Distributions:**
   Here is a simple Python script that uses the Boto3 library to check if logging is enabled for all CloudFront Distributions:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a CloudFront client
   cf = boto3.client('cloudfront')

   # List distributions
   distributions = cf.list_distributions()

   for distribution in distributions['DistributionList']['Items']:
       # Check if logging is enabled
       if 'Logging' in distribution['DistributionConfig'] and distribution['DistributionConfig']['Logging']['Enabled']:
           print(f"Logging is enabled for distribution {distribution['Id']}")
       else:
           print(f"Logging is NOT enabled for distribution {distribution['Id']}")
   ```

4. **Run the Python script:**
   You can run the Python script using any Python environment. The script will print out whether logging is enabled for each CloudFront Distribution in your AWS account.

Please note that this script only checks if logging is enabled, it does not enable logging if it is not already enabled.
