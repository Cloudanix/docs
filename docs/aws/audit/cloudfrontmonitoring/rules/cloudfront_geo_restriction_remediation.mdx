How to enable geo restriction for Cloudfront distributions?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Access the Amazon CloudFront Console:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the CloudFront service.
2. Select the Distribution:
   - Choose the CloudFront distribution for which you want to enable geo restriction.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "CloudFront Distributions Should Have Geo Restriction Enabled" Policy.)
3. Edit the Distribution Behavior:
   - In the distribution details page, click on the "Behaviors" tab.
   - Select the behavior for which you want to enable geo restriction, or create a new behavior if needed.
4. Configure Geo Restriction Settings:
   - Under the selected behavior, locate the "Restrict Viewer Access" section.
   - Choose the "Yes" option for "Restrict Viewer Access."
   - Select the "Whitelist" or "Blacklist" option based on your desired restriction approach.
5. Specify the Allowed or Denied Locations:
   - For "Whitelist" option: Specify the countries or geographic locations from which you want to allow access to your content.
   - For "Blacklist" option: Specify the countries or geographic locations from which you want to deny access to your content.
6. Save the Configuration:
   - Click on the "Yes, Edit" button or "Create" button (if creating a new behavior) to save the configuration changes.
7. Invalidate or Wait for Cache Invalidation (Optional):
   - If you have existing content cached in CloudFront, you may need to invalidate the cache or wait for the cache to expire before the geo restriction changes take effect.
   - To invalidate the cache, go to the "Invalidations" tab in the CloudFront distribution and create a new invalidation for the necessary files or directories.
