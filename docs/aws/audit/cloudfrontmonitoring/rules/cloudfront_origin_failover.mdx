### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the CloudFront service by typing 'CloudFront' into the search bar and selecting it from the dropdown menu.
3. In the CloudFront console, you will see a list of your distributions. Click on the ID of the distribution you want to check.
4. In the distribution settings, click on the 'Origins and Origin Groups' tab. Here, you can see if Origin Failover is enabled or not. If there are two origins listed under the 'Origin Group' with the 'Failover' status, then Origin Failover is enabled. If not, then it is not enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation: `pip install awscli`
   
   Configuration: `aws configure`

2. List CloudFront Distributions: Use the following command to list all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account:

   `aws cloudfront list-distributions --query 'DistributionList.Items[*].Id' --output text`

3. Describe CloudFront Distribution: For each distribution ID obtained from the previous step, run the following command to get detailed information about the distribution:

   `aws cloudfront get-distribution --id <distribution-id>`

4. Check Origin Failover: In the output of the above command, look for the `Origins` section. If the `FailoverCriteria` field is not present or if the `StatusCodes` field within it does not contain the HTTP status codes for which you want CloudFront to failover, then Origin Failover is not enabled for that distribution.

#### Using Python

To check if Origin Failover is enabled for CloudFront Distributions using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. Here are the steps:

1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3):**
   First, you need to set up AWS SDK (Boto3) for Python. This allows your Python scripts to interact with AWS services. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using the AWS CLI.

2. **Create a Python Script to List CloudFront Distributions:**
   Use the `list_distributions()` function to retrieve all the CloudFront distributions. Here's a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('cloudfront')

   response = client.list_distributions()

   for distribution in response['DistributionList']['Items']:
       print('Distribution ID: ', distribution['Id'])
   ```
   This script will print the ID of all your CloudFront distributions.

3. **Check Origin Failover for Each Distribution:**
   For each distribution, you need to check if Origin Failover is enabled. You can do this by checking the `Origins` attribute of each distribution. If the `Origins` attribute has more than one member, it means that Origin Failover is enabled. Here's how you can modify the above script to check this:
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('cloudfront')

   response = client.list_distributions()

   for distribution in response['DistributionList']['Items']:
       print('Distribution ID: ', distribution['Id'])
       if len(distribution['Origins']['Items']) > 1:
           print('Origin Failover is enabled')
       else:
           print('Origin Failover is not enabled')
   ```
   This script will print whether Origin Failover is enabled for each of your CloudFront distributions.

4. **Handle Pagination:**
   The `list_distributions()` function returns a maximum of 100 distributions at a time. If you have more distributions, you need to handle pagination by using the `NextMarker` element in the response. You can modify the above script to handle this:
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('cloudfront')

   paginator = client.get_paginator('list_distributions')
   for page in paginator.paginate():
       for distribution in page['DistributionList']['Items']:
           print('Distribution ID: ', distribution['Id'])
           if len(distribution['Origins']['Items']) > 1:
               print('Origin Failover is enabled')
           else:
               print('Origin Failover is not enabled')
   ```
   This script will print whether Origin Failover is enabled for all your CloudFront distributions, even if you have more than 100.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Origin Failover Should Be Enabled For CloudFront Distributions" for AWS using the AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the CloudFront service page.
3. Select the distribution for which you want to enable Origin Failover.
4. Click on the "Origins and Origin Groups" tab.
5. Select the origin for which you want to enable failover.
6. Click on the "Edit" button.
7. Scroll down to the "Origin Failover" section.
8. Click on the "Yes" radio button to enable Origin Failover.
9. Provide the alternate origin details in the "Alternate Domain Name" field.
10. Click on the "Create" button to create a new origin group.
11. Click on the "Save Changes" button to save the changes made.

Once you have followed these steps, Origin Failover will be enabled for your CloudFront distribution.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Origin Failover Should Be Enabled For CloudFront Distributions" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow the steps below:

1. Open your terminal and ensure that AWS CLI is installed and configured.

2. Run the following command to list all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account:
```
aws cloudfront list-distributions
```
3. Identify the CloudFront distribution that needs to be remediated.

4. Run the following command to update the CloudFront distribution to enable origin failover:
```
aws cloudfront update-distribution --id <cloudfront-distribution-id> --origin-failover-status-enabled
```
Replace `<cloudfront-distribution-id>` with the actual ID of the CloudFront distribution.

5. Verify that origin failover has been enabled for the CloudFront distribution by running the following command:
```
aws cloudfront get-distribution --id <cloudfront-distribution-id> --query 'Distribution.Origins.Items[].OriginFailoverCriteria.StatusCodes.Quantity' --output text
```
This command will return the number of status codes that are required to trigger a failover. If the output is greater than 0, it means that origin failover has been enabled for the CloudFront distribution.

6. Repeat the above steps for all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account that need to be remediated.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Origin Failover Should Be Enabled For CloudFront Distributions" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Origin Failover Should Be Enabled For CloudFront Distributions" for AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the required AWS SDK libraries in your Python code. You will need `boto3` and `botocore` libraries.

```
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Create a `boto3` client for CloudFront.

```
cloudfront_client = boto3.client('cloudfront')
```

3. Get the list of all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account.

```
distributions = cloudfront_client.list_distributions()['DistributionList']['Items']
```

4. Loop through all the distributions and check if the "Origin Failover" is enabled or not. If it is not enabled, enable it.

```
for distribution in distributions:
    distribution_id = distribution['Id']
    distribution_config = cloudfront_client.get_distribution_config(Id=distribution_id)['DistributionConfig']
    if not distribution_config.get('Enabled', False):
        distribution_config['Enabled'] = True
        origin_failover_config = distribution_config.get('OriginFailoverSettings', {})
        origin_failover_config['Enabled'] = True
        distribution_config['OriginFailoverSettings'] = origin_failover_config
        try:
            cloudfront_client.update_distribution(DistributionConfig=distribution_config, Id=distribution_id, IfMatch=distribution_config['ETag'])
            print(f'Origin Failover enabled for CloudFront distribution {distribution_id}')
        except ClientError as e:
            print(f'Error enabling Origin Failover for CloudFront distribution {distribution_id}: {e}')
```

5. Run the Python script to enable the "Origin Failover" for all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account.

Once the script is successfully executed, the "Origin Failover" will be enabled for all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account.
