How to enable origin failover for cloudfront distributions?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Access the Amazon CloudFront Console:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the CloudFront service.
2. Select the Distribution:
   - Choose the CloudFront distribution for which you want to enable origin failover.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Origin Failover Should Be Enabled For CloudFront Distributions" Policy.)
3. Edit the Distribution Settings:
   - In the distribution details page, click on the "Origins and Origin Groups" tab.
4. Configure Origin Groups:
   - Click on the "Create Origin Group" button to define an origin group.
   - Provide a name for the origin group.
   - Specify the primary and secondary origins for failover.
   - Set the failover criteria, such as the number of consecutive failures or the health check status.
5. Update the Default Behavior:
   - In the distribution details page, click on the "Behaviors" tab.
   - Select the default behavior or the specific behavior you want to enable failover for.
   - In the "Origin Settings" section, choose the origin group you created in the previous step from the "Origin Group" dropdown.
6. Save the Configuration:
   - Click on the "Yes, Edit" button to save the changes to the distribution settings.
7. Monitor Failover Status:
   - Once you enable origin failover, CloudFront will automatically monitor the health of your primary and secondary origins.
   - If the primary origin becomes unavailable or fails health checks, CloudFront will automatically failover to the secondary origin.
   - You can monitor the status of origin failover in the CloudFront console or through CloudFront logs and metrics.
