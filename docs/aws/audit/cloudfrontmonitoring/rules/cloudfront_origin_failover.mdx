1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the CloudFront service by typing 'CloudFront' into the search bar and selecting it from the dropdown menu.
3. In the CloudFront console, you will see a list of your distributions. Click on the ID of the distribution you want to check.
4. In the distribution settings, click on the 'Origins and Origin Groups' tab. Here, you can see if Origin Failover is enabled or not. If there are two origins listed under the 'Origin Group' with the second one marked as 'Failover', then Origin Failover is enabled. If not, then it is not enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can run any AWS CLI commands, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all CloudFront distributions: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws cloudfront list-distributions --query 'DistributionList.Items[*].Id' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of IDs for all your CloudFront distributions.

3. Check Origin Failover settings: For each CloudFront distribution ID returned by the previous command, run the following command to check the Origin Failover settings:

   ```
   aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id <distribution-id>
   ```
   Replace `<distribution-id>` with the ID of the CloudFront distribution you want to check. This command will return the configuration details of the specified CloudFront distribution.

4. Check the output: In the output of the previous command, look for the `Origins` section. If the `FailoverCriteria` and `StatusCodes` fields are present and correctly configured, then Origin Failover is enabled for the CloudFront distribution. If these fields are missing or misconfigured, then Origin Failover is not enabled.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You will need the boto3 library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can set your credentials for use by boto3 in several ways, but a common way is to use the AWS CLI. Run `aws configure` and then enter your access key, secret access key, and default region when prompted.

3. Write a Python script to check the CloudFront distributions: Here is a simple Python script that uses boto3 to retrieve all CloudFront distributions and check if Origin Failover is enabled.

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_origin_failover():
       client = boto3.client('cloudfront')
       distributions = client.list_distributions()
       for distribution in distributions['DistributionList']['Items']:
           for origin in distribution['Origins']['Items']:
               if 'OriginGroups' in distribution:
                   for group in distribution['OriginGroups']['Items']:
                       if group['FailoverCriteria']['StatusCodes']['Quantity'] > 0:
                           print(f"Origin Failover is enabled for distribution {distribution['Id']}")
                       else:
                           print(f"Origin Failover is not enabled for distribution {distribution['Id']}")
               else:
                   print(f"Origin Failover is not enabled for distribution {distribution['Id']}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_origin_failover()
   ```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using any Python interpreter. The script will print out the ID of each CloudFront distribution and whether Origin Failover is enabled or not. If Origin Failover is not enabled for a distribution, it may be a misconfiguration.

Please note that this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to list and describe CloudFront distributions. If you don't, you may need to adjust your IAM policies or roles.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Origin Failover Should Be Enabled For CloudFront Distributions" for AWS using the AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the CloudFront service page.
3. Select the distribution for which you want to enable Origin Failover.
4. Click on the "Origins and Origin Groups" tab.
5. Select the origin for which you want to enable failover.
6. Click on the "Edit" button.
7. Scroll down to the "Origin Failover" section.
8. Click on the "Yes" radio button to enable Origin Failover.
9. Provide the alternate origin details in the "Alternate Domain Name" field.
10. Click on the "Create" button to create a new origin group.
11. Click on the "Save Changes" button to save the changes made.

Once you have followed these steps, Origin Failover will be enabled for your CloudFront distribution.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Origin Failover Should Be Enabled For CloudFront Distributions" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow the steps below:

1. Open your terminal and ensure that AWS CLI is installed and configured.

2. Run the following command to list all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account:
```
aws cloudfront list-distributions
```
3. Identify the CloudFront distribution that needs to be remediated.

4. Run the following command to update the CloudFront distribution to enable origin failover:
```
aws cloudfront update-distribution --id <cloudfront-distribution-id> --origin-failover-status-enabled
```
Replace `<cloudfront-distribution-id>` with the actual ID of the CloudFront distribution.

5. Verify that origin failover has been enabled for the CloudFront distribution by running the following command:
```
aws cloudfront get-distribution --id <cloudfront-distribution-id> --query 'Distribution.Origins.Items[].OriginFailoverCriteria.StatusCodes.Quantity' --output text
```
This command will return the number of status codes that are required to trigger a failover. If the output is greater than 0, it means that origin failover has been enabled for the CloudFront distribution.

6. Repeat the above steps for all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account that need to be remediated.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Origin Failover Should Be Enabled For CloudFront Distributions" for AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Origin Failover Should Be Enabled For CloudFront Distributions" for AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the required AWS SDK libraries in your Python code. You will need `boto3` and `botocore` libraries.

```
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Create a `boto3` client for CloudFront.

```
cloudfront_client = boto3.client('cloudfront')
```

3. Get the list of all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account.

```
distributions = cloudfront_client.list_distributions()['DistributionList']['Items']
```

4. Loop through all the distributions and check if the "Origin Failover" is enabled or not. If it is not enabled, enable it.

```
for distribution in distributions:
    distribution_id = distribution['Id']
    distribution_config = cloudfront_client.get_distribution_config(Id=distribution_id)['DistributionConfig']
    if not distribution_config.get('Enabled', False):
        distribution_config['Enabled'] = True
        origin_failover_config = distribution_config.get('OriginFailoverSettings', {})
        origin_failover_config['Enabled'] = True
        distribution_config['OriginFailoverSettings'] = origin_failover_config
        try:
            cloudfront_client.update_distribution(DistributionConfig=distribution_config, Id=distribution_id, IfMatch=distribution_config['ETag'])
            print(f'Origin Failover enabled for CloudFront distribution {distribution_id}')
        except ClientError as e:
            print(f'Error enabling Origin Failover for CloudFront distribution {distribution_id}: {e}')
```

5. Run the Python script to enable the "Origin Failover" for all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account.

Once the script is successfully executed, the "Origin Failover" will be enabled for all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account.
