<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudFront service.

2. In the CloudFront dashboard, select the ID of the distribution that you want to check.

3. In the distribution settings, click on the "Behaviors" tab.

4. Check the "Viewer Protocol Policy" setting. If it is set to "HTTP and HTTPS" or "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS", then the communication with viewers is encrypted using HTTPS. If it is set to "HTTP Only", then the communication is not encrypted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the CloudFront distributions.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the CloudFront distributions using the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudfront list-distributions
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object with all the CloudFront distributions.

3. To check if communication with viewers is encrypted using HTTPS, you need to look at the ViewerProtocolPolicy under DefaultCacheBehavior. You can do this by using the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id <distribution-id>
   ```

   Replace `<distribution-id>` with the ID of the distribution you want to check. This command will return the configuration of the specified CloudFront distribution.

4. Finally, you can use a tool like `jq` to parse the JSON output and check the ViewerProtocolPolicy. The command would look something like this:

   ```
   aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id <distribution-id> | jq '.DistributionConfig.DefaultCacheBehavior.ViewerProtocolPolicy'
   ```

   If the output of this command is "redirect-to-https" or "https-only", then the communication with viewers is encrypted using HTTPS. If the output is "allow-all", then the communication is not necessarily encrypted.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You will need the boto3 library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can set your credentials for use by boto3 in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI tool. Run `aws configure` and then enter your access key, secret access key, and default region when prompted.

3. Write a Python script to check the CloudFront distributions: Here is a simple Python script that uses boto3 to retrieve all the CloudFront distributions and check if they are configured to communicate with viewers using HTTPS:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_cloudfront_https():
       client = boto3.client('cloudfront')
       distributions = client.list_distributions()
       for distribution in distributions['DistributionList']['Items']:
           if 'ViewerCertificate' in distribution and 'MinimumProtocolVersion' in distribution['ViewerCertificate']:
               if distribution['ViewerCertificate']['MinimumProtocolVersion'] != 'TLSv1.2_2018':
                   print(f"Distribution {distribution['Id']} is not configured to use HTTPS for communication with viewers.")
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_cloudfront_https()
   ```
   
   This script will print out the IDs of any distributions that are not configured to use at least TLSv1.2 for communication with viewers.

4. Run the script: You can run the script from your command line using the Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python check_cloudfront_https.py
   ```

   This will print out the IDs of any CloudFront distributions that are not configured to use HTTPS for communication with viewers. If no such distributions are found, the script will not output anything.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to your AWS console and navigate to the Amazon CloudFront service.

2. Click on the distribution ID for which you want to enable HTTPS.

3. In the distribution settings, click on the "Behaviors" tab.

4. Select the behavior for which you want to enable HTTPS and click on the "Edit" button.

5. In the "Edit Behavior" window, scroll down to the "Viewer Protocol Policy" section.

6. Select "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" from the dropdown list.

7. Click on the "Yes, Edit" button to save the changes.

8. Wait for the changes to propagate. This may take a few minutes.

9. Once the changes are propagated, your CloudFront distribution will be configured to use HTTPS for all viewer communications.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Communication With Viewers Should Be Encrypted Using HTTPS" in AWS using the AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Communication With Viewers Should Be Encrypted Using HTTPS" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine and run the following command to update the CloudFront distribution configuration:

```
aws cloudfront update-distribution --id <distribution-id> --distribution-config file://<path_to_config_file>
```

Note: Replace `<distribution-id>` with the ID of your CloudFront distribution and `<path_to_config_file>` with the path to your CloudFront distribution configuration file.

2. In the CloudFront distribution configuration file, add the following JSON code to enable HTTPS encryption for viewer communication:

```
"ViewerCertificate": {
  "CloudFrontDefaultCertificate": true,
  "MinimumProtocolVersion": "TLSv1.2_2018",
  "SSLSupportMethod": "sni-only"
}
```

3. Save the configuration file and run the update-distribution command again to apply the changes.

4. Wait for the CloudFront distribution to deploy the changes. This may take several minutes.

5. Verify that HTTPS encryption is enabled for viewer communication by accessing your CloudFront distribution using HTTPS. You can do this by visiting the domain name of your CloudFront distribution in a web browser and checking that the URL starts with "https://" and has a green padlock icon.

That's it! You have now remediated the misconfiguration "Communication With Viewers Should Be Encrypted Using HTTPS" in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Communication With Viewers Should Be Encrypted Using HTTPS" for AWS using python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS console and navigate to the CloudFront service.
2. Select the distribution for which you want to enable HTTPS.
3. Click on the "Behaviors" tab and select the behavior for which you want to enable HTTPS.
4. Click on "Edit" and then select "Yes" for the "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" option.
5. Scroll down to the "Viewer Protocol Policy" option and select "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS".
6. Save the changes.

To automate this process using Python, you can use the AWS SDK boto3. Here's a sample code:

```
import boto3

# Initialize the CloudFront client
cloudfront = boto3.client('cloudfront')

# Get the distribution ID for which you want to enable HTTPS
distribution_id = 'YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID'

# Get the current configuration for the distribution
response = cloudfront.get_distribution_config(Id=distribution_id)

# Enable HTTPS for the viewer
response['DistributionConfig']['ViewerCertificate']['MinimumProtocolVersion'] = 'TLSv1.2_2018'

# Save the updated configuration
cloudfront.update_distribution(DistributionConfig=response['DistributionConfig'], Id=distribution_id, IfMatch=response['ETag'])
```

Note: Replace `YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID` with the actual distribution ID for which you want to enable HTTPS.
