### More Info:

The communication between your Amazon CloudFront CDN distribution and its viewers (end users) should be encrypted using HTTPS in order to secure the delivery of your web application content

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

SOC2, NIST, GDPR

### Remediation

How to ensure that web content is encrypted between CloudFront distribution edge locations and your application viewers?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Use HTTPS for CloudFront Distribution:
   - Configure your CloudFront distribution to use HTTPS by specifying a valid SSL/TLS certificate. This ensures that the communication between viewers and CloudFront edge locations is encrypted.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Communication With Viewers Should Be Encrypted Using HTTPS" Policy.)
2. Viewer Protocol Policy:
   - In the CloudFront distribution settings, set the "Viewer Protocol Policy" to "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" or "HTTPS Only". This ensures that all client requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS or only accepted over HTTPS.
3. Origin Protocol Policy:
   - Configure the "Origin Protocol Policy" to use HTTPS if your origin supports it. This ensures that CloudFront communicates with your origin server over an encrypted connection.
4. HTTPS on the Origin Server:
   - If your origin server supports HTTPS, configure it to accept HTTPS requests. This ensures end-to-end encryption between CloudFront and your origin server.
5. Security Headers:
   - Implement security headers in your application, such as Content Security Policy (CSP), Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), and X-Content-Type-Options, to further enhance the security of your web content.
