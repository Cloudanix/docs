How to create and configure the required Cloudfront web distribution?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the CloudFront console:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the CloudFront service.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "AWS Account Should Use CloudFront CDN Service" Policy.)
2. Create a new web distribution:
   - Click on the "Create Distribution" button.
   - Select "Web" as the delivery method.
3. Configure the distribution settings:
   - In the "Origin Settings" section, specify the origin domain name and protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) for your backend server.
   - Choose the appropriate Origin Protocol Policy based on your requirements.
   - Configure other settings like Origin Path, Origin SSL Protocols, and Origin Read Timeout as needed.
4. Configure the default cache behavior:
   - In the "Default Cache Behavior Settings" section, configure the cache behavior for requests that don't match any defined cache behaviors.
   - Set the Viewer Protocol Policy to determine whether CloudFront responds to viewer requests with HTTP or HTTPS.
   - Configure the allowed HTTP methods, cached HTTP methods, and other cache settings as per your requirements.
5. Configure additional cache behaviors (if needed):
   - If you have specific caching requirements for different URL patterns or query strings, you can add additional cache behaviors.
   - Click on the "Add Behavior" button and configure the settings for each additional cache behavior.
6. Configure the distribution settings:
   - In the "Distribution Settings" section, specify the default root object, logging settings, and other options.
   - Choose whether to enable or disable IPv6, and whether to forward query strings to the origin server.
7. Configure SSL certificate (if needed):
   - In the "SSL Certificate" section, select the appropriate option for SSL certificate management.
   - If you want to use a custom SSL certificate, choose "Custom SSL Certificate (example.com)" and select the certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) or IAM.
8. Review and create the distribution:
   - Review all the settings on the summary page and make any necessary changes.
   - Click on the "Create Distribution" button to create the CloudFront web distribution.
9. Wait for the distribution to deploy:
   - It may take some time for the CloudFront distribution to deploy and become fully functional.
   - You can monitor the status in the CloudFront console until it shows as "Deployed."
