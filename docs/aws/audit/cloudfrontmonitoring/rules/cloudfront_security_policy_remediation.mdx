1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/.

2. In the CloudFront console, click on the ID of the distribution that you want to check.

3. In the distribution settings, click on the "Behaviors" tab.

4. In the Behaviors settings, look for the "SSL Protocol" field. This field indicates the security policy that the CloudFront distribution is using. The security policy determines the SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront uses to communicate with viewers, and the cipher that CloudFront uses to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers. 

Note: The security policy should be set to TLSv1.1_2016 or later, and the cipher should be set to ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 or stronger to ensure that the CloudFront distribution is using a security policy with an appropriate version and ciphers.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List CloudFront Distributions: Use the AWS CLI command "list-distributions" to get a list of all the CloudFront distributions in your AWS account. The command is as follows:
   ```
   aws cloudfront list-distributions
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the CloudFront distributions.

3. Extract the ViewerCertificate details: From the JSON output, you can extract the details of the ViewerCertificate for each CloudFront distribution. This can be done using the 'jq' command-line JSON processor. The command is as follows:
   ```
   aws cloudfront list-distributions | jq -r '.DistributionList.Items[].ViewerCertificate'
   ```
   This command will return the details of the ViewerCertificate for each CloudFront distribution, which includes the SSL certificate information.

4. Check the Security Policy: From the ViewerCertificate details, you can check the value of the 'MinimumProtocolVersion' field. This field indicates the security policy of the CloudFront distribution. If the value of this field is not 'TLSv1.2_2018' or 'TLSv1.2_2019', then the CloudFront distribution is using a security policy with inappropriate version and ciphers. The command to check the 'MinimumProtocolVersion' field is as follows:
   ```
   aws cloudfront list-distributions | jq -r '.DistributionList.Items[].ViewerCertificate.MinimumProtocolVersion'
   ```
   This command will return the value of the 'MinimumProtocolVersion' field for each CloudFront distribution.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You will need the boto3 library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can set your credentials via the AWS CLI, or by manually creating the files yourself. The default location for the file is `~/.aws/credentials`. At a minimum, the credentials file should look like this:

   ```bash
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Create a Python script: Now, you can create a Python script that uses the boto3 library to interact with the AWS CloudFront service. The script will list all your CloudFront distributions and check their security policies.

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('cloudfront')

   response = client.list_distributions()

   for distribution in response['DistributionList']['Items']:
       viewer_certificate = distribution['ViewerCertificate']
       if 'MinimumProtocolVersion' not in viewer_certificate or viewer_certificate['MinimumProtocolVersion'] != 'TLSv1.2_2018':
           print(f"Distribution {distribution['Id']} is using outdated or insecure TLS version")
       if 'SSLSupportMethod' not in viewer_certificate or viewer_certificate['SSLSupportMethod'] != 'sni-only':
           print(f"Distribution {distribution['Id']} is not using SNI for certificate delivery")
   ```

4. Run the Python script: Finally, you can run the Python script. It will print out the IDs of the CloudFront distributions that are using outdated or insecure TLS versions or are not using SNI for certificate delivery. If no such distributions are found, it will not print anything.

   ```bash
   python check_cloudfront_security.py
   ```
   
This script will help you identify misconfigurations in your CloudFront distributions' security policies. However, it's important to note that this is a basic script and might need to be adjusted based on your specific needs and environment.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the CloudFront Distribution Security Policy misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon CloudFront service.
3. Click on the "Distributions" tab from the left-hand menu.
4. Select the CloudFront distribution that needs to be remediated.
5. Click on the "Edit" button.
6. Scroll down to the "Security Policy" section.
7. Select the appropriate security policy version from the dropdown list. The recommended version is TLSv1.2_2018.
8. Select the appropriate ciphers from the "Cipher Suites" dropdown list. The recommended ciphers are AES128-SHA256 and AES256-SHA256.
9. Click on the "Yes, Edit" button to save the changes.

Once the changes are saved, the CloudFront distribution will use the appropriate security policies with the recommended version and ciphers.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. First, you need to create a security policy with appropriate version and ciphers that you want to use for your CloudFront distribution. You can use the following command to create a security policy:

```
aws cloudfront create-public-key --name <policy-name> --public-key-config '{"CallerReference": "<unique-id>", "Name": "<policy-name>", "PublicKey": "<public-key>", "Comment": "<comment>"}'
```

Here, `<policy-name>` is the name you want to give to your security policy, `<unique-id>` is a unique identifier for the policy, `<public-key>` is the actual public key that you want to use, and `<comment>` is an optional comment that you can add.

2. Once you have created your security policy, you need to update your CloudFront distribution to use this policy. You can use the following command to update your distribution:

```
aws cloudfront update-distribution --id <distribution-id> --distribution-config '{"ViewerCertificate": {"MinimumProtocolVersion": "<minimum-protocol-version>", "SSLSupportMethod": "<ssl-support-method>", "Certificate": "<certificate-arn>", "CertificateSource": "<certificate-source>", "SecurityPolicy": "<policy-name>"}}'
```

Here, `<distribution-id>` is the ID of your CloudFront distribution, `<minimum-protocol-version>` is the minimum TLS version that you want to use, `<ssl-support-method>` is the SSL support method that you want to use, `<certificate-arn>` is the ARN of the SSL certificate that you want to use, `<certificate-source>` is the source of the SSL certificate (either `iam` or `acm`), and `<policy-name>` is the name of the security policy that you created in step 1.

3. Finally, you should verify that your CloudFront distribution is now using the correct security policy. You can use the following command to get the details of your distribution:

```
aws cloudfront get-distribution --id <distribution-id>
```

Here, `<distribution-id>` is the ID of your CloudFront distribution. This command will return the details of your distribution, including the security policy that it is currently using.

That's it! By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of using inappropriate security policies with appropriate version and ciphers for your AWS CloudFront distributions using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudFront Distributions Should Use Security Policies With Appropriate Version And Ciphers" for AWS using python, follow the below steps:

1. Create a new security policy with appropriate version and ciphers using the AWS CLI command:

```
aws cloudfront create-security-policy --name <policy-name> --policy-config file://<policy-config-file>
```

Replace `<policy-name>` with the name you want to give to the new security policy and `<policy-config-file>` with the path to the JSON file containing the policy configuration.

2. Update the CloudFront distribution to use the new security policy using the AWS CLI command:

```
aws cloudfront update-distribution --id <distribution-id> --distribution-config file://<distribution-config-file>
```

Replace `<distribution-id>` with the ID of the CloudFront distribution you want to update and `<distribution-config-file>` with the path to the JSON file containing the distribution configuration.

3. Verify that the updated distribution is now using the new security policy with appropriate version and ciphers.

Note: You can also use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to perform the above steps programmatically.
