### Remediation

How to enable field-level encryption for CloudFront web distributions?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Generate a Key Pair:
   - Generate a public-private key pair that will be used for field-level encryption. You can use a tool like OpenSSL to generate the key pair.
2. Create a CloudFront Key Group:
   - In the CloudFront console, navigate to the "Key Groups" section and click on "Create Key Group".
   - Provide a name for the key group and select the public key that corresponds to the generated key pair.
3. Configure Field-Level Encryption Profiles:
   - In the CloudFront console, navigate to the "Field-level Encryption Profiles" section and click on "Create Field-level Encryption Profile".
   - Provide a name for the profile and configure the field-level encryption settings, including the segment field name and the key group you created in the previous step.
   - Repeat this step if you need to configure multiple profiles.
4. Update CloudFront Distribution:
   - Select the CloudFront distribution you want to enable field-level encryption for.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "CloudFront Distributions Should Have Field-Level Encryption Enabled" Policy.)
   - Click on the "Behaviors" tab and select the behavior that requires field-level encryption.
   - In the behavior settings, scroll down to the "Field-level Encryption Config" section.
   - Enable field-level encryption and select the appropriate encryption profile(s) you created in the previous step.
5. Update Your Application:
   - Modify your application to include the necessary encryption headers in the requests and handle the decryption of the responses.
