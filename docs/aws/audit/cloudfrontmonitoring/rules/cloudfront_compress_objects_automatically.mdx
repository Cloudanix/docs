<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/.

2. In the CloudFront console, in the list of distributions, choose the ID of the distribution that you want to check.

3. Under the "General" tab, click on "Edit" button.

4. In the "Distribution Settings" page, under the "Default Cache Behavior Settings" section, check the value of "Compress Objects Automatically". If it's set to "No", then the CloudFront web distribution is not configured to automatically compress web content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can run any AWS CLI commands, you need to install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided in the AWS CLI User Guide.

2. List all CloudFront distributions: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all of your CloudFront distributions:

   ```
   aws cloudfront list-distributions --query 'DistributionList.Items[*].Id' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all CloudFront distribution IDs.

3. Check the compression setting for each distribution: For each distribution ID returned by the previous command, use the following AWS CLI command to check the compression setting:

   ```
   aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id <distribution-id> --query 'DistributionConfig.DefaultCacheBehavior.Compress' --output text
   ```
   Replace `<distribution-id>` with the ID of the distribution you want to check. This command will return either `true` or `false`, indicating whether or not the distribution is configured to automatically compress web content.

4. Analyze the results: If the command returns `false` for any distribution, this means that the distribution is not configured to automatically compress web content. This is a misconfiguration that should be corrected to improve the performance of your web content delivery.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing your Python script, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3` in your terminal.

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the CloudFront client: In your Python script, you need to import the Boto3 library and initialize the CloudFront client. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import boto3

# Create a CloudFront client
cf = boto3.client('cloudfront')
```

3. Get the list of CloudFront distributions and check the compression settings: You can use the `list_distributions()` function to get a list of all CloudFront distributions. Then, you can iterate over each distribution and check if the `Compress` attribute is set to `True`. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Get the list of distributions
distributions = cf.list_distributions()

# Iterate over each distribution
for distribution in distributions['DistributionList']['Items']:
    # Get the distribution config
    config = cf.get_distribution_config(Id=distribution['Id'])
    
    # Check if the Compress attribute is set to True
    if not config['DistributionConfig']['DefaultCacheBehavior']['Compress']:
        print(f"Distribution {distribution['Id']} does not have automatic compression enabled.")
```

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run your Python script. If there are any CloudFront distributions that do not have automatic compression enabled, their IDs will be printed to the console. If no such distributions are found, nothing will be printed.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of CloudFront web distributions not automatically compressing web content in AWS using the AWS console, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudFront service.

2. Select the distribution that needs to be remediated.

3. Click on the "Behaviors" tab.

4. Click on the "Create Behavior" button.

5. In the "Create Behavior" dialog box, set the following values:

- Path Pattern: *
- Viewer Protocol Policy: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- Allowed HTTP Methods: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE
- Compress Objects Automatically: Yes
- Cache Based on Selected Request Headers: None

6. Click on the "Create" button to create the new behavior.

7. Wait for the distribution to update and propagate the changes.

After following these steps, CloudFront web distributions will automatically compress web content.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudFront Web Distributions Should Automatically Compress Web Content" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to get the ID of the distribution for which you want to enable automatic compression:

   ```
   aws cloudfront list-distributions --query "DistributionList.Items[].{Id:Id,DomainName:DomainName}"
   ```

   This will return a list of all your CloudFront distributions along with their IDs and domain names.

3. Once you have the distribution ID, run the following command to update the distribution configuration to enable automatic compression:

   ```
   aws cloudfront update-distribution --id <distribution-id> --distribution-config '{"Enabled":true,"Compress":true,"DefaultCacheBehavior":{"Compress":true}}'
   ```

   Replace `<distribution-id>` with the ID of the distribution you want to update.

4. After running the above command, the distribution configuration will be updated to enable automatic compression for web content.

5. Verify the changes by running the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudfront get-distribution --id <distribution-id> --query "Distribution.DistributionConfig.DefaultCacheBehavior"
   ```

   This will return the configuration of the default cache behavior for the distribution, which should now have the "Compress" property set to true.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "CloudFront Web Distributions Should Automatically Compress Web Content" for AWS using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of CloudFront web distributions not automatically compressing web content in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the required AWS SDK modules using the following code:

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Create a boto3 client for CloudFront using the following code:

```python
client = boto3.client('cloudfront')
```

3. Get a list of all CloudFront distributions using the following code:

```python
try:
    response = client.list_distributions()
    distributions = response['DistributionList']['Items']
except ClientError as e:
    print(e)
```

4. Iterate through each distribution and check if it has a default cache behavior with a gzip compression enabled using the following code:

```python
for distribution in distributions:
    try:
        response = client.get_distribution_config(Id=distribution['Id'])
        config = response['DistributionConfig']
        if config['DefaultCacheBehavior']['Compress']:
            print(f"Gzip compression is already enabled for {distribution['Id']}")
        else:
            config['DefaultCacheBehavior']['Compress'] = True
            response = client.update_distribution(
                DistributionConfig=config,
                Id=distribution['Id'],
                IfMatch=response['ETag']
            )
            print(f"Gzip compression enabled for {distribution['Id']}")
    except ClientError as e:
        print(e)
```

5. Save the Python script and run it to remediate the misconfiguration.

This script will enable gzip compression for all CloudFront distributions that do not have it enabled by updating the default cache behavior of each distribution.
