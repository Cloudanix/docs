How to ensure Cloudfront distributions automatically compresses web content?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Access the Amazon CloudFront Console:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the CloudFront service.
2. Select the Distribution:
   - Choose the CloudFront distribution for which you want to enable automatic content compression.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "CloudFront Web Distributions Should Automatically Compress Web Content" Policy.)
3. Edit the Distribution Behavior:
   - In the distribution details page, click on the "Behaviors" tab.
   - Select the behavior for which you want to enable content compression, or create a new behavior if needed.
4. Configure Compression Settings:
   - Under the selected behavior, locate the "Compress Objects Automatically" setting.
   - Enable this option to instruct CloudFront to automatically compress eligible web content.
5. Save the Configuration:
   - Click on the "Yes, Edit" button or "Create" button (if creating a new behavior) to save the configuration changes.
6. Invalidate or Wait for Cache Invalidation (Optional):
   - If you have existing content cached in CloudFront, you may need to invalidate the cache or wait for the cache to expire before the compression changes take effect.
   - To invalidate the cache, go to the "Invalidations" tab in the CloudFront distribution and create a new invalidation for the necessary files or directories.
