#### Using AWS Console

- Step 3: From the Dashboard top menu, click the Distribution Settings. Go to the behaviors tab and select the distribution default behavior.

- Step 6: Set the Viewer Protocol Policy attribute to HTTPS Only so that your application viewers can only access your web content using HTTPS.
