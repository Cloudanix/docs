How to enable logging for Cloudfront Distributions?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Access the Amazon CloudFront Console:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the CloudFront service.
2. Select the Distribution:
   - Choose the CloudFront distribution for which you want to enable logging.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Logging Should Be Enabled For CloudFront Distributions" Policy.)
3. Edit the Distribution Settings:
   - In the distribution details page, click on the "Logging" tab.
4. Configure Logging:
   - Select the "On" option for "Logging."
   - Specify the Amazon S3 bucket where you want to store the access logs. You can choose an existing bucket or create a new one.
   - Optionally, provide a prefix to organize the log files within the bucket.
5. Choose Whether to Include Cookies (Optional):
   - By default, CloudFront includes the cookies in the access logs. If you want to exclude cookies from the logs, uncheck the "Include Cookies" option.
6. Save the Configuration:
   - Click on the "Yes, Edit" button to save the logging configuration changes.
7. Grant CloudFront Permissions to Write Logs:
   - If you have selected a new S3 bucket for storing the logs, CloudFront requires permission to write the logs to that bucket. You need to grant the necessary permissions to CloudFront.
   - You can either update the bucket policy or configure an IAM role for CloudFront to access the bucket. Choose the appropriate method based on your requirements.
8. Wait for Logs to Generate:
   - Once you enable logging, CloudFront will start generating access logs for the requests made to your distribution.
   - It may take some time for the logs to appear in the specified S3 bucket, depending on the traffic volume.
