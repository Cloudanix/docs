   - Locate and select the CloudFront distribution for which you want to remove the SSLv3 protocol.
3. Edit the distribution:
   - Click on the "Distribution Settings" tab.
   - Click on the "Edit" button to modify the distribution settings.
4. Update the origin settings:
   - Scroll down to the "Origins and Origin Groups" section.
   - Select the origin for which you want to remove the SSLv3 protocol.
   - Click on the "Edit" button next to the selected origin.
5. Configure SSL/TLS settings:
   - In the "Origin Settings" section, scroll down to the "Origin Protocol Policy" option.
   - Choose the appropriate policy that supports modern, secure SSL/TLS protocols (such as TLSv1.2 or higher).
   - Ensure that SSLv3 is not selected or allowed.
6. Save the changes:
   - Click on the "Save Changes" button to update the origin settings.
