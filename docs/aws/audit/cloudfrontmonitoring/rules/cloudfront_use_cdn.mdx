How to ensure CDN is used for web applications in Cloudfront?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Create a CloudFront Distribution:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the CloudFront service.
   - Click on the "Create Distribution" button.
   - Choose the appropriate distribution type based on your requirements (e.g., Web, RTMP, etc.).
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Web Applications Should Use CDNs" Policy.)
2. Configure the Distribution:
   - In the "Create Distribution" wizard, select the "Web" distribution type.
   - Configure the following settings:
     - Origin Settings: Specify the origin of your web application (e.g., an S3 bucket or an HTTP server).
     - Default Cache Behavior Settings: Define the caching behavior, such as cache TTL (Time to Live), query string handling, and cookies.
     - Distribution Settings: Set the domain name, SSL certificate, and other configuration options.
3. Update DNS Configuration:
   - After creating the CloudFront distribution, you will be provided with a CloudFront domain name (e.g., xxxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net).
   - Update your DNS configuration to point your domain name (e.g., www.example.com) to the CloudFront domain name.
   - This can be done by creating a CNAME record in your DNS provider's settings.
4. Test and Verify:
   - Wait for the DNS changes to propagate, which can take some time depending on your DNS provider.
   - Access your web application using the domain name associated with the CloudFront distribution (e.g., www.example.com).
   - Verify that the web application is being served through CloudFront by checking the response headers, which should include the CloudFront-related headers.
