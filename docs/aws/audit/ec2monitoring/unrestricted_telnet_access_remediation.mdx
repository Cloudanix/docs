How to determine if your EC2 security groups allow unrestricted Telnet access?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the left navigation panel, under NETWORK & SECURITY section, choose Security Groups.

- Step 2: Click inside the attributes filter box located under the dashboard top menu and select the following options from the dropdown list:
  A: Choose Protocol and select TCP from the protocols list.
  B: Choose Port Range, type 23 as input for the port number then press Enter.
- Step 3: Select an EC2 security group returned as result, and Select the Inbound tab from the dashboard bottom panel.

- Step 4: Verify the value available in the Source column for any inbound/ingress rules with the Port Range set to 23. If one or more rules have the source set to 0.0.0.0/0 or::/0 (Anywhere), the selected security group allows unrestricted traffic on port 23, therefore the Telnet access to the associated EC2 instance(s) is not secured.
