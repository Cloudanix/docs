### Remediation

How to ensure that the EC2 instances in your AWS account are not associated with default security groups created with your VPCs?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the navigation panel, under NETWORK & SECURITY section, choose Security Groups.

- Step 2: Click inside the attributes filter box located under the dashboard top menu, choose Group Name from the dropdown list and enter default to return the EC2 default security group. Select the default security group returned as result.

- Step 3: To replace the default security group assigned to your instance(s), create a new custom security group and transfer any existing inbound/outbound rules to it. To create the necessary security group, perform the following actions:
  A: Click the Actions dropdown button from the dashboard top menu and select Copy to new.
  B: In the Create Security Group dialog box, provide the following details:
  a. In the Security group name box, enter a name for your new custom security group.
  b. In the Description box, provide a description to reflect the security group usage.
  c. From the VPC dropdown list, select the appropriate VPC ID/name.
  d. Inside the Inbound tab, review and configure the ingress rules copied automatically from the default security group.
  e. Inside the Outbound tab, review and configure the egress rules copied automatically from the default security group.
  f. Click Create button to create the custom EC2 security group.

- Step 4: Now that the inbound and outbound rules are transferred to the new security group it is safe to replace the default security group with the custom one within the EC2 instance(s) network configuration. To replace it, perform the following actions:
  A: In the navigation panel, under INSTANCES section, choose Instances.
  B: Select the EC2 instance that you want to configure (see Audit section part I to identify the appropriate instances).
  C: Click the Actions dropdown button from the dashboard top menu, select Networking and click Change Security Group.
  D: In the Change Security Groups dialog box, uncheck the default security group and check the new custom security group.
  E: Click Assign Security Groups to apply the changes.
  F: Repeat steps b â€“ e to replace the default security group for other EC2 instances available in the current region.
