<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of SSM (AWS Systems Manager) session length being too long in EC2 using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create or Update an SSM Session Manager Preferences Document:**
   - First, you need to create or update an SSM document that specifies the session preferences, including the maximum session duration.
   - Use the following command to create a new document or update an existing one:

     ```sh
     aws ssm create-document \
       --name "SSM-SessionManager-Preferences" \
       --document-type "Session" \
       --content '{
         "schemaVersion": "1.0",
         "description": "SSM Session Manager Preferences",
         "sessionPreferences": {
           "idleSessionTimeout": "PT1H"  # Set the desired session length, e.g., 1 hour
         }
       }' \
       --document-format "JSON"
     ```

2. **Attach the SSM Document to the Instance Profile:**
   - Ensure that the instance profile associated with your EC2 instances has the necessary permissions to use the SSM document.
   - Use the following command to attach the document to the instance profile:

     ```sh
     aws iam put-role-policy \
       --role-name YourInstanceProfileRoleName \
       --policy-name SSM-SessionManager-Preferences-Policy \
       --policy-document '{
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
           {
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Action": [
               "ssm:StartSession",
               "ssm:TerminateSession",
               "ssm:ResumeSession"
             ],
             "Resource": "*"
           },
           {
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Action": "ssm:GetDocument",
             "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:region:account-id:document/SSM-SessionManager-Preferences"
           }
         ]
       }'
     ```

3. **Update the SSM Agent Configuration on EC2 Instances:**
   - Ensure that the SSM Agent on your EC2 instances is configured to use the session preferences document.
   - Use the following command to update the SSM Agent configuration:

     ```sh
     aws ssm send-command \
       --instance-ids "i-0123456789abcdef0" \
       --document-name "AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage" \
       --parameters '{"action":["Install"],"installationType":["Uninstall and reinstall"],"name":["AmazonCloudWatchAgent"]}'
     ```

4. **Verify the Configuration:**
   - Verify that the SSM session preferences have been applied correctly by starting a session and checking the session timeout.
   - Use the following command to start a session and observe the timeout behavior:

     ```sh
     aws ssm start-session --target "i-0123456789abcdef0"
     ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that the SSM session length is configured to a minimum duration, thereby preventing the misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of SSM (AWS Systems Manager) Session Length being too long in EC2 instances using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   - Ensure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
     ```bash
     pip install boto3
     ```

2. **Create a Python Script to Configure SSM Session Manager:**
   - Use Boto3 to interact with AWS Systems Manager and set the session length. Below is a sample script to set the session length to a minimum value (e.g., 1 hour).

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon SSM
   ssm_client = boto3.client('ssm')

   # Define the minimum session length in seconds (e.g., 1 hour = 3600 seconds)
   minimum_session_length = 3600

   # Update the SSM Session Manager preferences
   response = ssm_client.update_document(
       Name='SSM-SessionManagerRunShell',
       DocumentVersion='$LATEST',
       DocumentFormat='JSON',
       Content={
           "schemaVersion": "2.2",
           "description": "SSM Session Manager Run Shell",
           "sessionType": "Standard_Stream",
           "parameters": {
               "maxSessionDuration": {
                   "type": "String",
                   "default": str(minimum_session_length),
                   "description": "The maximum session duration in seconds."
               }
           }
       }
   )

   print("SSM Session Manager preferences updated successfully.")
   ```

3. **Validate the Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the configuration has been applied correctly by retrieving the document and checking the session length.

   ```python
   response = ssm_client.get_document(
       Name='SSM-SessionManagerRunShell',
       DocumentVersion='$LATEST'
   )

   document_content = response['Content']
   print("Current SSM Session Manager configuration:")
   print(document_content)
   ```

4. **Automate the Script Execution:**
   - To ensure that the session length remains compliant, you can automate the execution of this script using AWS Lambda or a scheduled task (e.g., using AWS CloudWatch Events or AWS EventBridge).

   ```python
   import boto3
   import json

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       ssm_client = boto3.client('ssm')

       minimum_session_length = 3600

       response = ssm_client.update_document(
           Name='SSM-SessionManagerRunShell',
           DocumentVersion='$LATEST',
           DocumentFormat='JSON',
           Content=json.dumps({
               "schemaVersion": "2.2",
               "description": "SSM Session Manager Run Shell",
               "sessionType": "Standard_Stream",
               "parameters": {
                   "maxSessionDuration": {
                       "type": "String",
                       "default": str(minimum_session_length),
                       "description": "The maximum session duration in seconds."
                   }
               }
           })
       )

       return {
           'statusCode': 200,
           'body': json.dumps('SSM Session Manager preferences updated successfully.')
       }
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that the SSM Session Length is set to a minimum value, thereby preventing the misconfiguration.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Systems Manager home page.

2. In the navigation pane, choose Session Manager. This will open the Session Manager dashboard.

3. In the Session Manager dashboard, select Preferences from the left-hand side menu. This will open the Preferences page where you can view and edit your Session Manager preferences.

4. In the Preferences page, look for the Session expiration field. This field indicates the maximum length of time that a session can remain active. If the session length is not set to a minimum (as per your organization's security policy), then it is a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all SSM documents: You can list all the SSM documents in your AWS account by running the following command:
   ```
   aws ssm list-documents
   ```
   This command will return a list of all SSM documents along with their details.

3. Describe SSM document: To check the session length of a specific SSM document, you need to describe it using the following command:
   ```
   aws ssm describe-document --name "document-name"
   ```
   Replace "document-name" with the name of the SSM document you want to check. This command will return the details of the specified SSM document.

4. Check Session Length: In the output of the previous command, look for the "SessionDuration" field. This field indicates the maximum length of time that a session can run on the specified SSM document. If the value of this field is less than the minimum required session length, then it indicates a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. Boto3 allows you to directly create, update, and delete AWS services from your Python scripts.

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS using your access keys.

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Use the `describe_instances` method to get a list of all EC2 instances. Then, for each instance, use the `describe_instance_attribute` method to get the `UserData` attribute, which contains the SSM session length.

```python
ec2 = session.resource('ec2')

for instance in ec2.instances.all():
    response = ec2.describe_instance_attribute(
        InstanceId=instance.id,
        Attribute='userData'
    )
    ssm_session_length = response['UserData']
    print(f'Instance ID: {instance.id}, SSM Session Length: {ssm_session_length}')
```

4. Now, you can check if the SSM session length is less than the minimum required length. If it is, print a warning message.

```python
min_length = 60  # replace with your minimum required length

for instance in ec2.instances.all():
    response = ec2.describe_instance_attribute(
        InstanceId=instance.id,
        Attribute='userData'
    )
    ssm_session_length = response['UserData']
    if ssm_session_length < min_length:
        print(f'WARNING: Instance {instance.id} has SSM session length {ssm_session_length}, which is less than the minimum required length {min_length}.')
```

Please note that you need to replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'`, `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'`, and `'us-west-2'` with your actual AWS access key, secret key, and region respectively. Also, replace `60` with your actual minimum required SSM session length.

#
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The SSM Session Length should be set to a minimum for security reasons. To remediate this for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to update the SSM Document:

```
aws ssm update-document --name "AWS-StartSSHSession" --content "{\"schemaVersion\":\"1.0\",\"description\":\"AWS Systems Manager document to start an SSH session to an instance\",\"parameters\":{\"portNumber\":{\"type\":\"String\",\"description\":\"The port number on which the SSH service is listening (usually 22)\",\"default\":\"22\"},\"sessionLength\":{\"type\":\"String\",\"description\":\"The duration of the session (in seconds)\",\"default\":\"3600\"}},\"mainSteps\":[{\"action\":\"aws:runShellScript\",\"name\":\"runShellScript\",\"inputs\":{\"runCommand\":[\"sudo sed -i 's/\\#   ClientAliveInterval 0/ClientAliveInterval 300/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\",\"sudo sed -i 's/\\#   ClientAliveCountMax 3/ClientAliveCountMax 0/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\",\"sudo service sshd restart\"]}}]}"
```

2. This command will update the SSM Document with a new session length of 3600 seconds (1 hour). If you want to set a different session length, change the value of the `sessionLength` parameter in the command.

3. After the SSM Document is updated, you can use it to start an SSH session to an instance with the new session length. To start an SSH session, run the following command:

```
aws ssm start-session --target instance-id --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters '{"portNumber":["22"],"sessionLength":["3600"]}'
```

4. Replace `instance-id` with the ID of the instance you want to connect to.

5. This command will start an SSH session with a session length of 3600 seconds (1 hour). If you want to set a different session length, change the value of the `sessionLength` parameter in the command.

6. After the SSH session is started, you can use it to perform any necessary actions on the instance.

By following these steps, you can remediate the SSM Session Length misconfiguration in AWS.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of SSM session length being minimum in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.

2. Select the instance for which you want to remediate the SSM session length.

3. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Instance Settings" and then "Modify IAM Role".

4. In the "Modify IAM Role" window, select the IAM role that has the required permissions to modify the SSM session length.

5. Once you have selected the IAM role, click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

6. Now, open your Python IDE and import the required libraries.

```python
import boto3
```

7. Create a boto3 session object and specify the region where your instance is located.

session = boto3.Session(region_name='us-east-1')
```

8. Create an SSM client object using the session object.

```python
ssm_client = session.client('ssm')
```

9. Use the modify_instance_information() method to modify the SSM session length.

```python
response = ssm_client.modify_instance_information(
    InstanceId='instance-id',
    InstanceInformation={
        'SSMActivationId': 'activation-id',
        'SSMActivationCode': 'activation-code',
        'AgentVersion': 'LATEST',
        'PingStatus': 'Online',
        'PlatformType': 'Linux',
        'PlatformName': 'Amazon Linux AMI',
        'PlatformVersion': '2018.03',
        'HostName': 'ec2-xx-xx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com',
        'IPAddress': 'xx.xx.xxx.xxx',
        'ComputerName': 'ip-xx-xx-xxx-xxx',

        'AssociationOverview': {
            'DetailedStatus': 'Success',
            'InstanceAssociationStatusAggregatedCount': {
                'Failed': 0,
                'InProgress': 0,
                'Success': 1,
                'TimedOut': 0,
                'NoStatus': 0
            }
        }
    },
    DesiredInstanceInformation={
        'SsmSessionDurationSeconds': 3600
    }
)
```

10. In the above code, replace the 'instance-id' with the ID of your instance and 'activation-id' and 'activation-code' with the activation ID and activation code of your SSM agent.

11. Also, modify the 'SsmSessionDurationSeconds' according to your requirement.
