### More Info:

Ensure that all active sessions in the AWS Session Manager do not exceed the period of time set in the rule settings. Sessions that are active for longer than expected could be the result of suspicious activity. Session manager gives users the ability to open a shell into EC2 instances or execute commands on containers running in ECS.

How to ensure SSM session length is minimum in EC2

#### Using AWS Console

To ensure that the Session Manager session length is kept to a minimum in EC2 instances, you can configure the session timeout setting in the Systems Manager (SSM) preferences. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Systems Manager service.

2. In the left navigation pane, choose "Session Manager" under the "Instances & Nodes" section.

3. On the Session Manager page, click on "Preferences" in the top-right corner.

4. In the Preferences page, you'll find the "Session Timeout" setting. Adjust this setting to your desired session length. The default session length is 1 hour (3600 seconds).

5. Modify the session timeout value to a lower value, such as 15 minutes (900 seconds) or any other appropriate duration.

6. Click on the "Save preferences" button to apply the changes.

By setting a lower session timeout value, you ensure that the Session Manager sessions on EC2 instances will automatically terminate after the specified duration of inactivity. This helps minimize the risk of leaving active sessions open for an extended period of time, improving security and resource management.
