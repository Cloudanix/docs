### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the left navigation pane, under the "Network & Security" section, click on "Security Groups".
3. In the Security Groups page, you will see a list of all the security groups associated with your EC2 instances. Click on the security group that you want to check.
4. In the details pane at the bottom, click on the "Inbound" tab. Here, you can see all the inbound rules for the selected security group. If there is a rule that allows unrestricted FTP access (i.e., the protocol is FTP (port 20-21) and the source is set to 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0), then the EC2 instance has a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all security groups: The next step is to list all the security groups in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query "SecurityGroups[*].{Name:GroupName,ID:GroupId}"
   ```
   This command will return a list of all security groups along with their names and IDs.

3. Check for unrestricted FTP access: Now, for each security group, you need to check if it allows unrestricted FTP access. FTP uses port 21, so you need to check if this port is open to the world (0.0.0.0/0). You can do this by running the following command for each security group:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query "SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions[*].{FromPort:FromPort,ToPort:ToPort,IpRanges:IpRanges[*].CidrIp}"
   ```
   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group you want to check. This command will return a list of all IP permissions for the specified security group.

4. Analyze the output: If the output of the previous command includes an entry where `FromPort` is 21, `ToPort` is 21, and `IpRanges` includes 0.0.0.0/0, then the security group allows unrestricted FTP access. If there is no such entry, then the security group does not allow unrestricted FTP access.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and import the necessary Python libraries. You will need the boto3 library, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc.

```python
pip install boto3
import boto3
```

2. Create an EC2 resource object using the boto3 library. This object will allow you to interact with your EC2 instances.

```python
ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
```

3. Iterate over all security groups associated with your EC2 instances. For each security group, check the inbound rules to see if any allow unrestricted FTP access (port 21 open to 0.0.0.0/0).

```python
for security_group in ec2.security_groups.all():
    for permission in security_group.ip_permissions:
        for ip_range in permission['IpRanges']:
            if '0.0.0.0/0' in ip_range['CidrIp'] and permission['FromPort'] <= 21 and permission['ToPort'] >= 21:
                print(f"Security Group {security_group.id} allows unrestricted FTP access.")
```

4. If the script prints out any security group IDs, those are the groups that have misconfigurations allowing unrestricted FTP access. You should investigate these security groups further and modify their inbound rules as necessary to restrict FTP access.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the unrestricted FTP access issue in AWS, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Select the EC2 instance(s) that have unrestricted FTP access.
4. Click on the "Security Groups" tab at the bottom of the page.
5. Identify the security group that is associated with the instance(s) and click on it.
6. Click on the "Inbound Rules" tab.
7. Locate the rule that allows unrestricted FTP access (port 21) and select it.
8. Click on the "Delete" button to remove the rule.
9. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, the unrestricted FTP access issue will be remediated for the selected EC2 instance(s).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the unrestricted FTP access issue in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the security groups in your AWS account:
```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups
```

3. Identify the security group that has unrestricted FTP access.

4. Run the following command to remove the unrestricted FTP access from the identified security group:
```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 21 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```
Note: Replace `<security-group-id>` with the actual ID of the security group that needs to be updated.

5. Verify that the FTP access has been removed by running the following command:
```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>
```
Note: Replace `<security-group-id>` with the actual ID of the security group that was updated.

6. Repeat the above steps for all the security groups in your AWS account to ensure that unrestricted FTP access is not allowed in any of them.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the unrestricted FTP access issue in AWS using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate unrestricted FTP access in AWS, you can use the following steps in Python:

Step 1: Identify the Security Group with unrestricted FTP access
```
import boto3
aws_account_id = 'YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID'
region = 'YOUR_AWS_REGION'
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region)
response = ec2.describe_security_groups()
for sg in response['SecurityGroups']:
    for ip_permission in sg['IpPermissions']:
        if 'FromPort' in ip_permission and ip_permission['FromPort'] == 21 and 'IpRanges' in ip_permission:
            for ip_range in ip_permission['IpRanges']:
                if ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                    print('Security Group ID: ', sg['GroupId'])
```
This code will list all the security groups that have unrestricted FTP access.

Step 2: Update the Security Group to restrict FTP access
```
import boto3
aws_account_id = 'YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID'
region = 'YOUR_AWS_REGION'
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region)
security_group_id = 'YOUR_SECURITY_GROUP_ID'
response = ec2.revoke_security_group_ingress(
    GroupId=security_group_id,
    IpPermissions=[
        {
            'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
            'FromPort': 21,
            'ToPort': 21,
            'IpRanges': [
                {
                    'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'
                },
            ],
        },
    ],
)
```
This code will restrict FTP access to the specified security group.

Step 3: Verify that FTP access is restricted
```
import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.settimeout(5)
try:
    s.connect(('FTP_SERVER_IP', 21))
    print('FTP access is still unrestricted')
except:
    print('FTP access is restricted')
s.close()
```
This code will verify that FTP access is restricted by attempting to connect to the FTP server. If the connection fails, it means that FTP access is restricted.
