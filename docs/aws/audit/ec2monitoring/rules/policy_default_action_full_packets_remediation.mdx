### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the VPC Dashboard.
2. In the left navigation pane, select "Security Groups" under the "Security" section.
3. Select the security group you want to inspect. In the details pane at the bottom, select the "Inbound Rules" tab.
4. Check the rules listed. If there is a rule that allows all traffic (0.0.0.0/0) on all protocols (ALL) and all ports (0-65535), then the Network Firewall Policy Default Action is not set for full packets.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```

   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all Network ACLs: Once your AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the Network ACLs in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-network-acls
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object that contains information about all the Network ACLs in your account.

3. Parse the output: You can parse the output of the previous command to check the default action for each Network ACL. You can do this by using the `jq` command-line JSON processor. Here is an example command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-network-acls | jq -r '.NetworkAcls[].Entries[] | select(.RuleAction=="deny" and .Egress==false and .RuleNumber==32767)'
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the Network ACLs that have their default action set to deny for inbound traffic.

4. Check for Full Packets: To check if the default action is set for full packets, you need to check if the `CidrBlock` is set to `0.0.0.0/0`. You can do this by modifying the previous command as follows:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-network-acls | jq -r '.NetworkAcls[].Entries[] | select(.RuleAction=="deny" and .Egress==false and .RuleNumber==32767 and .CidrBlock=="0.0.0.0/0")'
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the Network ACLs that have their default action set to deny for inbound traffic and are set for full packets.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key'
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_key'
   ```

3. Write the Python script: The following Python script uses Boto3 to retrieve all the network ACLs in your AWS account and checks if the default action is set to allow all traffic:

   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

   # Retrieve all network ACLs
   network_acls = ec2.network_acls.all()

   for acl in network_acls:
       # Check the inbound rules
       for entry in acl.entries:
           if entry['RuleAction'] == 'allow' and entry['CidrBlock'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
               print(f"Network ACL {acl.id} allows all inbound traffic.")

       # Check the outbound rules
       for entry in acl.entries:
           if entry['RuleAction'] == 'allow' and entry['CidrBlock'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
               print(f"Network ACL {acl.id} allows all outbound traffic.")
   ```

4. Run the Python script: You can run the Python script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python check_network_acl.py
   ```

   This will print out the IDs of the network ACLs that allow all inbound and outbound traffic. If no such ACLs are found, it means that the default action is not set to allow all traffic, which is a good security practice.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the network firewall policy default action for full packets in AWS EC2 using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. **Login to the AWS Management Console**: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to the VPC Dashboard**: In the AWS Management Console, go to the VPC dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu and then clicking on "VPC" under the Networking & Content Delivery section.

3. **Select the VPC**: From the VPC dashboard, select the VPC where the EC2 instance with the misconfigured network firewall policy is located.

4. **Navigate to the Network ACLs**: In the VPC dashboard, click on "Network ACLs" in the left-hand menu to view the list of network access control lists associated with the selected VPC.

5. **Identify the Network ACL**: Identify the network ACL associated with the subnet where the misconfigured EC2 instance resides. Click on the relevant network ACL to view its details.

6. **Edit the Network ACL**: In the network ACL details page, identify the inbound and outbound rules that need to be modified to set the default action for full packets.

7. **Update the Default Action**: Locate the default action rule in the inbound and outbound rules sections of the network ACL. Edit the default action rule to allow full packets by specifying the appropriate protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP) and port range.

8. **Save the Changes**: Once you have updated the default action rule to allow full packets, save the changes to apply the new configuration to the network ACL.

9. **Verify the Configuration**: Verify that the default action for full packets has been successfully set in the network ACL associated with the subnet where the EC2 instance is located.

By following these steps, you can remediate the network firewall policy default action for full packets in AWS EC2 using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of the network firewall policy default action in AWS EC2 using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Security Group**: First, identify the security group associated with the EC2 instance that needs to be remediated. You can do this by either checking the EC2 instance details in the AWS Management Console or by using the following AWS CLI command:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids YOUR_INSTANCE_ID --query "Reservations[].Instances[].SecurityGroups[].GroupId" --output text
   ```

2. **Update the Security Group**: Once you have identified the security group, you can update the network firewall policy default action to "deny" for all inbound and outbound traffic using the following AWS CLI command:
   ```
   aws ec2 update-security-group-rule-descriptions-ingress --group-id YOUR_SECURITY_GROUP_ID --ip-permissions '[{"IpProtocol": "-1", "PrefixListIds": [], "IpRanges": [], "UserIdGroupPairs": [], "Ipv6Ranges": [], "FromPort": -1, "ToPort": -1, "Description": "Deny all inbound traffic"}]'
   ```

   ```
   aws ec2 update-security-group-rule-descriptions-egress --group-id YOUR_SECURITY_GROUP_ID --ip-permissions '[{"IpProtocol": "-1", "PrefixListIds": [], "IpRanges": [], "UserIdGroupPairs": [], "Ipv6Ranges": [], "FromPort": -1, "ToPort": -1, "Description": "Deny all outbound traffic"}]'
   ```

3. **Verify the Changes**: You can verify that the default action for full packets is now set to "deny" for both inbound and outbound traffic by checking the security group rules in the AWS Management Console or by using the following AWS CLI command:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids YOUR_SECURITY_GROUP_ID
   ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of the network firewall policy default action in AWS EC2 using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the network firewall policy default action setting for AWS EC2 using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update the Network ACL associated with the VPC. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this misconfiguration:

Step 1: Install Boto3
Ensure that you have Boto3 installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

Step 2: Write Python script
Create a Python script with the following code to update the Network ACL default action for full packets:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the EC2 client
ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

# Specify the VPC ID
vpc_id = 'YOUR_VPC_ID'

# Specify the Network ACL ID
network_acl_id = 'YOUR_NETWORK_ACL_ID'

# Update the Network ACL entry to set the default action for full packets
response = ec2_client.create_network_acl_entry(
    CidrBlock='0.0.0.0/0',
    Egress=False,
    NetworkAclId=network_acl_id,
    Protocol='-1',
    RuleAction='allow',
    RuleNumber=100
)

print("Network ACL default action updated successfully.")
```

Replace `YOUR_VPC_ID` and `YOUR_NETWORK_ACL_ID` with the actual VPC ID and Network ACL ID where the misconfiguration exists.

Step 3: Run the Python script
Save the Python script and run it using the Python interpreter. This script will update the Network ACL entry to set the default action for full packets.

```bash
python remediate_network_acl.py
```

After running this script, the default action for full packets in the Network ACL should be set, remediating the misconfiguration.
