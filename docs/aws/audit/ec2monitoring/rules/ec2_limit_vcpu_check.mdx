title: EC2 Instances Should Not Reach vCPU Limit
---

### More Info:

Monitoring vCPU-based limits for on-demand EC2 instances avoids resource starvation. Service Quotas is an AWS service that enables you to view and manage your quotas from a central location. Quotas, also referred to as limits, are the maximum value for your resources, actions, and items in your AWS account.

3. In the "Service Quotas" page, click on the "vCPUs" link.
4. You will see a table that lists the vCPU limits for each EC2 instance family.
