How to update security group inbound or ingress configuration to restrict RPC TCP port 135 access to specific entities?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Select the Security Group that needs to be updated.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Unrestricted RPC Access Should Not Be Allowed" Policy.)
4. Click on the "Inbound Rules" tab.
5. Locate the rule that allows access to TCP port 135.
6. Click on the "Edit" button next to the rule.
7. In the "Source" field, enter the IP address or range of IP addresses that should be allowed access to this port. For example, if you want to allow access only from a specific IP address, enter that IP address in the "Source" field. If you want to allow access from a range of IP addresses, enter the range in CIDR notation.
8. Click on the "Save" button to update the security group.
9. Verify that the change has been applied by testing connectivity to TCP port 135 from a source IP address that should be allowed access.
