### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the EC2 dashboard, select the 'Instances' option from the left-hand side menu. This will display a list of all the EC2 instances that are currently running.
3. Select the EC2 instance you want to check for non-specified applications. In the 'Description' tab at the bottom of the page, you can find details about the instance, including the AMI ID, instance type, and security groups.
4. To check for non-specified applications, you need to connect to the instance. You can do this by selecting the 'Connect' button at the top of the page. This will open a new window where you can choose your preferred connection method (SSH, EC2 Instance Connect, or a standalone SSH client). Once connected, you can run commands to list all installed applications and check for any that should not be installed.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Once you have AWS CLI installed and configured, you can proceed to the next steps.

2. List all the EC2 instances in your AWS account using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with details about all your EC2 instances.

3. To check the applications installed on an instance, you need to SSH into the instance. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com
   ```

   Replace "/path/my-key-pair.pem" with the path to your private key file and "ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com" with the public DNS of your EC2 instance.

4. Once you are logged into the instance, you can check the installed applications by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo yum list installed
   ```

   This command will list all the installed packages on the instance. You can look through this list to check if any non-specified applications are installed.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```
Then, configure your AWS credentials either via environment variables or via AWS CLI.

2. Import the necessary modules and create an EC2 resource object:

```python
import boto3

# Create an EC2 resource object using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)
ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
```

3. Iterate over all EC2 instances and check for installed applications:

```python
# Get information for all running instances
running_instances = ec2.instances.filter(Filters=[{
    'Name': 'instance-state-name',
    'Values': ['running']}])

for instance in running_instances:
    # Connect to the instance
    ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
    ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
    ssh.connect(instance.public_dns_name, username='ec2-user', key_filename='path_to_your_pem_file')

    # Execute the command to get the list of installed applications
    stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command("dpkg --get-selections")

    # Read the output and check for the application
    output = stdout.readlines()
    for line in output:
        if "none" in line:
            print(f"None specified application found on instance {instance.id}")
```

4. Handle exceptions: It's important to handle exceptions in your script to avoid unexpected crashes. You can use Python's built-in exception handling mechanisms for this:

```python
try:
    # Your code here
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

Please note that this script assumes that you are using a Linux-based EC2 instance and that you have the necessary permissions to connect to the instance and execute commands. Also, replace 'path_to_your_pem_file' with the actual path to your .pem file.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of having unspecified applications installed on an AWS EC2 instance, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Identify Installed Applications**:
   - Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH or RDP.
   - Use commands like `dpkg -l` for Debian-based systems or `rpm -qa` for Red Hat-based systems to list all installed packages.

2. **Remove Unspecified Applications**:
   - Identify any applications that are not supposed to be installed on the instance.
   - Use the appropriate package manager (`apt` for Debian-based systems, `yum` for Red Hat-based systems) to uninstall the unwanted applications. For example:
     - Debian-based systems: `sudo apt-get remove <package_name>`
     - Red Hat-based systems: `sudo yum remove <package_name>`

3. **Update Security Groups**:
   - Ensure that the security groups associated with the EC2 instance only allow necessary inbound and outbound traffic. Restrict access to only required ports and protocols.

4. **Implement IAM Policies**:
   - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to enforce policies that restrict users' ability to install applications on EC2 instances.

5. **Enable AWS Config Rules**:
   - Set up AWS Config Rules to monitor and enforce compliance with your desired configuration standards. This can help prevent unauthorized applications from being installed on EC2 instances.

6. **Regularly Monitor and Audit**:
   - Regularly monitor the instances for any unauthorized changes and audit the installed applications to ensure compliance with organizational policies.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of having unspecified applications installed on an AWS EC2 instance and ensure that only approved applications are running on your instances.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of having unspecified applications installed on an AWS EC2 instance using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Installed Applications:** First, you need to identify the applications that are installed on the EC2 instance. You can SSH into the instance and manually check the installed applications or use a configuration management tool like Ansible to gather this information.

2. **Remove Unspecified Applications:** Once you have identified the applications that are not supposed to be installed on the instance, you can remove them using the following command:
   
   ```
   sudo yum remove <package_name>
   ```

   Replace `<package_name>` with the name of the package you want to remove. You may need to run this command for each unwanted package.

3. **Update Security Groups:** If the applications were accessed over the network, you should also update the security groups associated with the EC2 instance to restrict access to only necessary ports and protocols.

4. **Create an AMI:** After removing the unwanted applications, you may want to create a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the instance. This will ensure that any new instances launched from this AMI do not have the unwanted applications installed.

5. **Terminate and Replace Instance:** If removing the unwanted applications is not feasible or if the instance is heavily compromised, you may consider terminating the instance and launching a new instance from the updated AMI.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having unspecified applications installed on an AWS EC2 instance using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of having unspecified applications installed on an AWS EC2 instance using Python, you can use the AWS Systems Manager Run Command to execute a script that will uninstall any unwanted applications.

Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this issue:

1. **Identify Unspecified Applications**:
   - Use the following Python script to list all installed applications on the EC2 instance:
     ```python
     import subprocess
     installed_apps = subprocess.check_output("dpkg --get-selections", shell=True).decode()
     print(installed_apps)
     ```
   - Review the list of installed applications to identify the unspecified ones that need to be uninstalled.

2. **Create a Python Script to Uninstall Unspecified Applications**:
   - Create a Python script that will uninstall the identified unspecified applications. For example:
     ```python
     import subprocess
     apps_to_uninstall = ["app1", "app2"]  # List of unspecified applications to uninstall
     for app in apps_to_uninstall:
         subprocess.call(f"sudo apt-get remove --purge {app} -y", shell=True)
     ```

3. **Install AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)**:
   - If you haven't already, install the Boto3 library for Python using pip:
     ```
     pip install boto3
     ```

4. **Use Boto3 to Execute the Script on EC2 Instance**:
   - Use the following Python script to execute the uninstallation script on the EC2 instance:
     ```python
     import boto3

     # Specify the EC2 instance ID
     instance_id = 'your_instance_id'

     # Specify the path to the uninstall script on the EC2 instance
     script_path = '/path/to/uninstall_script.py'

     ssm_client = boto3.client('ssm')

     response = ssm_client.send_command(
         InstanceIds=[instance_id],
         DocumentName="AWS-RunShellScript",
         Parameters={'commands': [f'python {script_path}']}
     )

     print(response)
     ```

5. **Review the Execution**:
   - Monitor the execution of the script using the response from the `send_command` function to ensure that the unspecified applications are successfully uninstalled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having unspecified applications installed on an AWS EC2 instance using Python and AWS Systems Manager Run Command.
