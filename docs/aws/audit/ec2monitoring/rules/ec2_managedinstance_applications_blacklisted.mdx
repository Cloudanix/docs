### More Info:

This rule checks if none of the specified applications are installed on the instance. Optionally, specify the version. Newer versions will not be denylisted. Optionally, specify the platform to apply the rule only to instances running that platform.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of having unspecified applications installed on an AWS EC2 instance, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Identify Installed Applications**:
   - Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH or RDP.
   - Use commands like `dpkg -l` for Debian-based systems or `rpm -qa` for Red Hat-based systems to list all installed packages.

2. **Remove Unspecified Applications**:
   - Identify any applications that are not supposed to be installed on the instance.
   - Use the appropriate package manager (`apt` for Debian-based systems, `yum` for Red Hat-based systems) to uninstall the unwanted applications. For example:
     - Debian-based systems: `sudo apt-get remove <package_name>`
     - Red Hat-based systems: `sudo yum remove <package_name>`

3. **Update Security Groups**:
   - Ensure that the security groups associated with the EC2 instance only allow necessary inbound and outbound traffic. Restrict access to only required ports and protocols.

4. **Implement IAM Policies**:
   - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to enforce policies that restrict users' ability to install applications on EC2 instances.

5. **Enable AWS Config Rules**:
   - Set up AWS Config Rules to monitor and enforce compliance with your desired configuration standards. This can help prevent unauthorized applications from being installed on EC2 instances.

6. **Regularly Monitor and Audit**:
   - Regularly monitor the instances for any unauthorized changes and audit the installed applications to ensure compliance with organizational policies.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of having unspecified applications installed on an AWS EC2 instance and ensure that only approved applications are running on your instances.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of having unspecified applications installed on an AWS EC2 instance using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Installed Applications:** First, you need to identify the applications that are installed on the EC2 instance. You can SSH into the instance and manually check the installed applications or use a configuration management tool like Ansible to gather this information.

2. **Remove Unspecified Applications:** Once you have identified the applications that are not supposed to be installed on the instance, you can remove them using the following command:
   
   ```
   sudo yum remove <package_name>
   ```

   Replace `<package_name>` with the name of the package you want to remove. You may need to run this command for each unwanted package.

3. **Update Security Groups:** If the applications were accessed over the network, you should also update the security groups associated with the EC2 instance to restrict access to only necessary ports and protocols.

4. **Create an AMI:** After removing the unwanted applications, you may want to create a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the instance. This will ensure that any new instances launched from this AMI do not have the unwanted applications installed.

5. **Terminate and Replace Instance:** If removing the unwanted applications is not feasible or if the instance is heavily compromised, you may consider terminating the instance and launching a new instance from the updated AMI.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having unspecified applications installed on an AWS EC2 instance using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of having unspecified applications installed on an AWS EC2 instance using Python, you can use the AWS Systems Manager Run Command to execute a script that will uninstall any unwanted applications.

Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this issue:

1. **Identify Unspecified Applications**:
   - Use the following Python script to list all installed applications on the EC2 instance:
     ```python
     import subprocess
     installed_apps = subprocess.check_output("dpkg --get-selections", shell=True).decode()
     print(installed_apps)
     ```
   - Review the list of installed applications to identify the unspecified ones that need to be uninstalled.

2. **Create a Python Script to Uninstall Unspecified Applications**:
   - Create a Python script that will uninstall the identified unspecified applications. For example:
     ```python
     import subprocess
     apps_to_uninstall = ["app1", "app2"]  # List of unspecified applications to uninstall
     for app in apps_to_uninstall:
         subprocess.call(f"sudo apt-get remove --purge {app} -y", shell=True)
     ```

3. **Install AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)**:
   - If you haven't already, install the Boto3 library for Python using pip:
     ```
     pip install boto3
     ```

4. **Use Boto3 to Execute the Script on EC2 Instance**:
   - Use the following Python script to execute the uninstallation script on the EC2 instance:
     ```python
     import boto3

     # Specify the EC2 instance ID
     instance_id = 'your_instance_id'

     # Specify the path to the uninstall script on the EC2 instance
     script_path = '/path/to/uninstall_script.py'

     ssm_client = boto3.client('ssm')

     response = ssm_client.send_command(
         InstanceIds=[instance_id],
         DocumentName="AWS-RunShellScript",
         Parameters={'commands': [f'python {script_path}']}
     )

     print(response)
     ```

5. **Review the Execution**:
   - Monitor the execution of the script using the response from the `send_command` function to ensure that the unspecified applications are successfully uninstalled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having unspecified applications installed on an AWS EC2 instance using Python and AWS Systems Manager Run Command.
