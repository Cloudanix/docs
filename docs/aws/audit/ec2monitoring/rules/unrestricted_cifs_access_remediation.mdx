1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the left navigation pane, under the "NETWORK & SECURITY" section, click on "Security Groups".
3. In the "Security Groups" page, you will see a list of all security groups associated with your EC2 instances. Select the security group you want to inspect.
4. In the lower panel, click on the "Inbound" tab to view the inbound rules. Look for rules where the "Type" is set to "All traffic" or "CIFS" (Common Internet File System). If the "Source" is set to "0.0.0.0/0" or "::/0", it means that CIFS access is unrestricted.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```

   During the configuration process, you will be asked to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all security groups: Once your AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the security groups in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query "SecurityGroups[*].{Name:GroupName,ID:GroupId}"
   ```

   This command will return a list of all security groups along with their names and IDs.

3. Check for unrestricted CIFS access: For each security group, you need to check if it allows unrestricted CIFS access. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query 'SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions[*].{FromPort:FromPort,ToPort:ToPort,IpRanges:IpRanges[*].CidrIp}'
   ```

   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group you want to check. This command will return a list of all IP permissions for the specified security group.

4. Analyze the output: In the output of the previous command, look for any permissions that have `FromPort` set to 445 (the port used by CIFS) and `IpRanges` set to `0.0.0.0/0` (which represents unrestricted access). If you find any such permissions, it means that unrestricted CIFS access is allowed.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You can set up your AWS credentials in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI tool to store them in ~/.aws/credentials. You can install AWS CLI using pip:

```python
pip install awscli
aws configure
```

3. Write a Python script to check for unrestricted CIFS access: 

```python
import boto3

def check_cifs_access():
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
    security_groups = ec2.security_groups.all()

    for group in security_groups:
        if group.ip_permissions:
            for perm in group.ip_permissions:
                if perm['IpProtocol'] == 'tcp' and 'FromPort' in perm and 'ToPort' in perm:
                    if perm['FromPort'] <= 445 and perm['ToPort'] >= 445:
                        for range in perm['IpRanges']:
                            if range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                                print(f"Security Group {group.id} allows unrestricted CIFS access")

check_cifs_access()
```

4. Run the script: This script will print out the IDs of any security groups that allow unrestricted CIFS access. You can run the script from your command line like so:

```python
python check_cifs_access.py
```

This script works by fetching all of your EC2 security groups, then checking each one to see if it has any inbound rules that allow TCP traffic on port 445 (the port used by CIFS) from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0). If it finds any such rules, it prints out the ID of the security group.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the unrestricted CIFS access issue in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Select the Security Group associated with the EC2 instance that has unrestricted CIFS access.
4. Click on the "Inbound Rules" tab.
5. Locate the rule that allows unrestricted CIFS access and select it.
6. Click on the "Edit" button.
7. Change the source IP range to only allow access from trusted IP addresses or a specific IP range.
8. Save the changes.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the unrestricted CIFS access issue in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of unrestricted CIFS access in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to list all the Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems in your AWS account:

```
aws efs describe-file-systems
```

3. Identify the file system that has unrestricted CIFS access.

4. Run the following command to modify the file system policy to restrict CIFS access:

```
aws efs put-file-system-policy --file-system-id fs-12345678 --policy "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"RestrictCIFSAccess\",\"Effect\":\"Deny\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"*\"},\"Action\":[\"elasticfilesystem:ClientMount\",\"elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite\"],\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:us-east-1:123456789012:file-system/fs-12345678\",\"Condition\":{\"Bool\":{\"aws:SecureTransport\":\"false\"}}}]}"
```

Replace `fs-12345678` with the ID of the file system that has unrestricted CIFS access.

5. Verify that the policy has been updated by running the following command:

```
aws efs describe-file-system-policy --file-system-id fs-12345678
```

This command should return the updated policy for the file system.

6. Test the file system to ensure that CIFS access has been restricted.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate unrestricted CIFS access in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
import boto3
```

2. Create an Amazon S3 client:

```
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
```

3. Retrieve the current bucket policy:

```
bucket_policy = s3.get_bucket_policy(Bucket='your-bucket-name')
```

4. Check if the policy allows unrestricted CIFS access:

```
if 'CIFS' in bucket_policy['Policy']:
    # Remove the CIFS permission
    new_policy = bucket_policy['Policy'].replace('CIFS', '')
    # Update the bucket policy
    s3.put_bucket_policy(Bucket='your-bucket-name', Policy=new_policy)
```

5. If the policy allows unrestricted CIFS access, remove the CIFS permission from the policy:

```
new_policy = bucket_policy['Policy'].replace('CIFS', '')
```

6. Update the bucket policy:

```
s3.put_bucket_policy(Bucket='your-bucket-name', Policy=new_policy)
```

By following these steps, you can remediate unrestricted CIFS access in AWS using Python.
