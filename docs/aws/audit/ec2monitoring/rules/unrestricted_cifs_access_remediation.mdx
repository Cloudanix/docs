<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of unrestricted CIFS access in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to list all the Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems in your AWS account:

```
aws efs describe-file-systems
```

3. Identify the file system that has unrestricted CIFS access.

4. Run the following command to modify the file system policy to restrict CIFS access:

```
aws efs put-file-system-policy --file-system-id fs-12345678 --policy "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"RestrictCIFSAccess\",\"Effect\":\"Deny\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"*\"},\"Action\":[\"elasticfilesystem:ClientMount\",\"elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite\"],\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:us-east-1:123456789012:file-system/fs-12345678\",\"Condition\":{\"Bool\":{\"aws:SecureTransport\":\"false\"}}}]}"
```

Replace `fs-12345678` with the ID of the file system that has unrestricted CIFS access.

5. Verify that the policy has been updated by running the following command:

```
aws efs describe-file-system-policy --file-system-id fs-12345678
```

This command should return the updated policy for the file system.

6. Test the file system to ensure that CIFS access has been restricted.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate unrestricted CIFS access in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
import boto3
```

2. Create an Amazon S3 client:

```
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
```

3. Retrieve the current bucket policy:

```
bucket_policy = s3.get_bucket_policy(Bucket='your-bucket-name')
```

4. Check if the policy allows unrestricted CIFS access:

```
if 'CIFS' in bucket_policy['Policy']:
    # Remove the CIFS permission
    new_policy = bucket_policy['Policy'].replace('CIFS', '')
    # Update the bucket policy
    s3.put_bucket_policy(Bucket='your-bucket-name', Policy=new_policy)
```

5. If the policy allows unrestricted CIFS access, remove the CIFS permission from the policy:

```
new_policy = bucket_policy['Policy'].replace('CIFS', '')
```

6. Update the bucket policy:

```
s3.put_bucket_policy(Bucket='your-bucket-name', Policy=new_policy)
```

By following these steps, you can remediate unrestricted CIFS access in AWS using Python.
