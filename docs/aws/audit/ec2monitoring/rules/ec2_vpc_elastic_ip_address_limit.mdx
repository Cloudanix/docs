### Remediation

How to remediate if EC2-VPC elastic IP address limit is reached

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
2. From the left navigation pane, click on "Elastic IPs" to view the list of Elastic IP addresses.
3. Verify that you have reached the limit of EC2-VPC Elastic IP addresses. The "Account limit" column will display the maximum number of Elastic IP addresses allowed for your account.
4. Determine if you need additional Elastic IP addresses in EC2-VPC or if you can optimize your IP address usage:
   - If you require additional Elastic IP addresses, proceed to step 5.
   - If you can optimize your IP address usage, review your existing Elastic IP addresses and check if any are unused or no longer needed. Select the unused Elastic IP addresses and click on the "Release Elastic IPs" button above the list to free up capacity. Confirm the release when prompted.
5. Request a limit increase for the EC2-VPC Elastic IP addresses by clicking on the "Request limit increase" link in the "Account limit" column. Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information to request the increase. AWS will review the request, and if approved, you will be able to allocate more Elastic IP addresses in EC2-VPC.
6. While waiting for the limit increase, consider using Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) with private IP addresses instead of Elastic IP addresses where possible. ENIs can be associated with instances in your VPC and provide additional networking capabilities.
7. If you require additional IP addresses urgently and cannot wait for the limit increase, you may consider releasing any unused or unnecessary Elastic IP addresses and then associating them with the instances that require IP connectivity.
8. Once the limit increase is approved, you can allocate new Elastic IP addresses by clicking on the "Allocate new address" button in the Elastic IPs console. Specify the number of addresses you need and click "Allocate".
9. Associate the newly allocated Elastic IP addresses with the desired instances in your VPC. Select the Elastic IP address and click on the "Associate Elastic IP address" button. Follow the prompts to associate the address with the desired instance in the VPC.
