### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, select "Managed Instances" under "Systems Manager Shared Resources".
3. In the Managed Instances page, select the instance you want to check.
4. In the instance details pane, under the "Inventory" tab, check if the "AWS:Application" inventory type is enabled and collecting data. If it is not, then EC2 Systems Manager is not configured to collect blacklisted inventory.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "describe-instance-information" command to list all your EC2 instances. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws ssm describe-instance-information
   ```

3. To check if EC2 Systems Manager is configured to collect blacklisted inventory, you need to use the "get-inventory" command. This command returns a list of your inventory types, or inventory items, that are currently being tracked by Systems Manager Inventory. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws ssm get-inventory --filters "Key=AWS:Application,Values=Blacklisted"
   ```

4. If the command returns an empty list, it means that EC2 Systems Manager is not configured to collect blacklisted inventory. If it returns a list of instances, it means that EC2 Systems Manager is configured to collect blacklisted inventory.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) on your local machine. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3`. After installing Boto3, you need to configure it with your AWS credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. Import necessary libraries and create a session:
   In your Python script, you need to import the necessary libraries and create a session. Here is an example:

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ```

3. Connect to the EC2 service and get the list of all instances:
   Next, you need to connect to the EC2 service and get the list of all instances. Here is an example:

   ```python
   ec2 = session.resource('ec2')
   instances = ec2.instances.all()
   ```

4. Check the EC2 Systems Manager configuration:
   Finally, you need to check the EC2 Systems Manager configuration for each instance. You can do this by calling the `describe_instance_information` method on the `ssm` client. Here is an example:

   ```python
   ssm = session.client('ssm')
   for instance in instances:
       response = ssm.describe_instance_information(
           InstanceInformationFilterList=[
               {
                   'key': 'InstanceIds',
                   'valueSet': [
                       instance.id,
                   ]
               },
           ]
       )
       for instance_info in response['InstanceInformationList']:
           if 'AWS:BlacklistedEvents' in instance_info['InstanceInformation']:
               print(f"Instance {instance.id} is configured to collect blacklisted inventory.")
           else:
               print(f"Instance {instance.id} is not configured to collect blacklisted inventory.")
   ```
   
Please note that the above script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to call the `describe_instance_information` method on the `ssm` client. If you don't have these permissions, you will need to update your IAM policy accordingly.

1. **Access AWS Systems Manager Console**: 
   - Log in to your AWS account and navigate to the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the Systems Manager service by searching for it in the search bar.

2. **Navigate to Inventory Explorer**:
   - In the Systems Manager console, navigate to the 'Explorer' section from the left-hand menu.

3. **Identify Blacklisted Inventory**:
   - In the Inventory Explorer, you will be able to see a list of all the managed instances and the collected inventory details.
   - Identify the blacklisted inventory items that are being collected by EC2 Systems Manager.

4. **Update Inventory Collection Configuration**:
   - Click on 'Inventory Setup' in the Systems Manager console.
   - Review the inventory collection configuration settings to identify the blacklisted items.
   - Click on 'Edit Inventory Schema' to modify the inventory collection configuration.

5. **Remove Blacklisted Items**:
   - In the inventory schema, locate the blacklisted inventory items that are being collected.
   - Remove the blacklisted items from the inventory schema by deselecting them or deleting them from the configuration.

6. **Save Changes**:
   - Once you have removed the blacklisted items from the inventory collection configuration, click on 'Save' to apply the changes.

7. **Verify Configuration**:
   - Go back to the Inventory Explorer and verify that the blacklisted inventory items are no longer being collected.

8. **Monitor for Compliance**:
   - Regularly monitor the inventory collection configuration to ensure that blacklisted items are not being collected in the future.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration where EC2 Systems Manager is configured to collect blacklisted inventory in AWS, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. **Identify the Blacklisted Inventory Configuration**: First, you need to identify the blacklisted inventory configuration in the EC2 Systems Manager. This can be done by checking the Systems Manager Inventory configuration settings.

2. **Update the Inventory Configuration**: You will need to update the inventory configuration to remove the blacklisted items. This can be done by modifying the Systems Manager Inventory configuration using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).

3. **Install Boto3**: If you haven't already, install the Boto3 library in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install boto3
    ```

4. **Write Python Script**: Write a Python script that uses Boto3 to update the Systems Manager Inventory configuration. Here is an example script that removes the blacklisted inventory items:
    ```python
    import boto3

    # Initialize the EC2 client
    ssm_client = boto3.client('ssm')

    # Get the current inventory configuration
    response = ssm_client.get_inventory_configuration(
        InstanceId='your-instance-id-here'
    )

    # Remove the blacklisted items from the inventory configuration
    inventory_configuration = response['InventoryConfiguration']
    blacklisted_items = ['blacklisted-item1', 'blacklisted-item2']  # Add the blacklisted items here
    updated_inventory = [item for item in inventory_configuration if item not in blacklisted_items]

    # Update the inventory configuration
    response = ssm_client.put_inventory_configuration(
        InstanceId='your-instance-id-here',
        InventoryConfiguration=updated_inventory
    )

    print('Inventory configuration updated successfully.')
    ```

5. **Replace 'your-instance-id-here' and 'blacklisted-itemX'**: Replace 'your-instance-id-here' with the actual EC2 instance ID and add the blacklisted items to be removed from the inventory configuration.

6. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script in your environment. This will update the Systems Manager Inventory configuration to remove the blacklisted items.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration where EC2 Systems Manager is configured to collect blacklisted inventory in AWS using Python.
