How to ensure security group allows inbound traffic from RFC 1918 CIDRs?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
2. From the left navigation pane, click on "Security Groups" under the "Network & Security" section.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Security Groups Should Not Allow Inbound Traffic From RFC 1918" Policy.)
3. Review the list of existing security groups and identify the security group that you want to modify.
4. Select the desired security group.
5. In the "Inbound rules" tab, review the existing inbound rules.
6. If there are any inbound rules that allow traffic from any source or from specific IP ranges, make sure to note them down for later reference.
7. Delete any existing inbound rules that allow unrestricted or specific IP range traffic. To delete a rule, select it and click on the "Remove" button.
8. Click on the "Add Rule" button to add a new inbound rule.
9. In the "Type" dropdown menu, select the appropriate protocol (e.g., HTTP, SSH, RDP) that you want to allow inbound access for.
10. In the "Source" field, enter the RFC 1918 CIDR blocks that you want to allow inbound traffic from. The commonly used RFC 1918 CIDR blocks are:
    - 10.0.0.0/8
    - 172.16.0.0/12
    - 192.168.0.0/16
11. Repeat steps 8-10 for each protocol or port you want to allow inbound access for from RFC 1918 CIDRs.
12. Review the new inbound rules and ensure that they only allow traffic from the specified RFC 1918 CIDR blocks.
13. Click on the "Save rules" button to apply the changes to the security group.
