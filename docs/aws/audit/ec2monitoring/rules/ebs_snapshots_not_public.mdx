### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, below are the step by step instructions to remediate this misconfiguration for AWS using the AWS console:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.

2. Click on the "Snapshots" option from the left-hand side menu.

3. Select the snapshot that you want to remediate and click on the "Modify Permissions" option from the "Actions" dropdown menu.

4. In the "Modify Snapshot Permissions" dialog box, uncheck the "Public" checkbox.

5. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

6. Repeat the above steps for all the snapshots that are public.

7. You can also ensure that all future snapshots are not public by modifying the default permissions. For this, click on the "Set Permissions" option from the "Actions" dropdown menu.

8. In the "Set Default Permissions" dialog box, uncheck the "Public" checkbox.

9. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

That's it! By following the above steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of public EC2 instance snapshots in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Instance Snapshots Should Not Be Public" for AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

Step 2: Run the following command to list all the snapshots that are public:

```
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --owner-ids self --query "Snapshots[?Public==true].{ID:SnapshotId,Status:State,Encrypted:Encrypted,Volume:VolumeId}"
```

Step 3: Identify the snapshot ID that is public and needs to be remediated.

Step 4: Run the following command to modify the snapshot attribute and make it private:

```
aws ec2 modify-snapshot-attribute --snapshot-id <snapshot-id> --attribute createVolumePermission --operation-type remove --user-ids all
```

Note: Replace `<snapshot-id>` with the actual snapshot ID that needs to be remediated.

Step 5: Verify that the snapshot is no longer public by running the command in step 2 again.

Step 6: Repeat steps 3-5 for all the snapshots that are public and need to be remediated.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Instance Snapshots Should Not Be Public" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of EC2 Instance Snapshots being public in AWS using python, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and go to the EC2 dashboard.
2. Click on the "Snapshots" option on the left-hand side menu.
3. Select the snapshot that is public and click on the "Modify Permissions" option from the "Actions" dropdown.
4. In the "Modify Snapshot Permissions" window, uncheck the "Public" option and add the appropriate AWS account IDs or IAM users to whom you want to grant access to the snapshot.
5. Click on the "Add Permission" button to add the selected AWS account IDs or IAM users.
6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

To automate this process using python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here's the code snippet:

```python
import boto3

# Create an EC2 client
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Specify the snapshot ID
snapshot_id = 'your-snapshot-id'

# Modify the snapshot permissions
response = ec2.modify_snapshot_attribute(
    Attribute='createVolumePermission',
    SnapshotId=snapshot_id,
    OperationType='remove',
    UserIds=['all'],
    GroupNames=[]
)

print(response)
```

This code removes the "createVolumePermission" attribute for the specified snapshot ID, which effectively makes the snapshot private. You can customize the code as per your requirements.
