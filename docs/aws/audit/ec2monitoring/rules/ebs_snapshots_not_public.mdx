How to fix EC2 snapshots publicly accessible?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon EC2 service by searching for "EC2" in the AWS services search bar and selecting "EC2" from the results.
3. In the EC2 dashboard, click on "Snapshots" in the left sidebar.
4. Locate the snapshot(s) that are marked as public or that you want to secure.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "EC2 Instance Snapshots Should Not Be Public" Policy.)
5. Select the checkbox next to the snapshot(s) you want to modify.
6. At the top of the snapshots list, click on the "Actions" button.
7. From the dropdown menu, choose "Modify Permissions."
8. In the "Modify Snapshot Permissions" dialog box, uncheck the box next to "Public."
9. Click on the "Add Permission" button to specify who should have access to the snapshot.
10. In the "Add Permission" dialog box, select the appropriate entity type (AWS account, IAM role, or IAM user) from the "Grantee" dropdown menu.
11. Enter the necessary information for the selected entity type (e.g., AWS account ID or IAM user/role ARN) in the corresponding field.
12. Choose the desired permissions to grant to the entity from the "Permissions" dropdown menu. Typically, "Create volume," "Delete volume," and "Attach volume" permissions are sufficient.
13. Click on the "Add Permission" button to add the permission for the specified entity.
14. Repeat steps 10-13 for each entity that should have access to the snapshot.
15. Once you have added all the necessary permissions, click on the "Save" button to apply the modifications.
16. The public access to the selected snapshot(s) will be revoked, and they will only be accessible to the entities you specified.
