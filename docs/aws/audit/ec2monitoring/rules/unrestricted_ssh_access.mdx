### Remediation

How to update security group inbound or ingress configuration to restrict SSH TCP port 22 access to specific entities?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. From the left-hand menu, select "Security Groups" under the "Network & Security" category.
3. Select the security group that you want to modify.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Unrestricted SSH Access Should Not Be Allowed" Policy.)
4. Click on the "Inbound Rules" tab.
5. Locate the rule that allows SSH TCP port 22 access. It should have a source of "0.0.0.0/0" which means it allows access from any IP address.
6. Click on the "Edit" button next to the rule.
7. In the "Source" field, enter the IP address or range of IP addresses that you want to allow SSH access from. For example, if you want to allow access from a specific IP address, enter the IP address in the "Source" field. If you want to allow access from a range of IP addresses, enter the IP address range in CIDR notation (e.g. 192.168.0.0/16).
8. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.
9. Verify that the changes have been applied by attempting to SSH into the instance from an IP address that is not on the allowed list. The connection should be refused.
