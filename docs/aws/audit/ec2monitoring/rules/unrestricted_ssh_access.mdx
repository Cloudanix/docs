### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent unrestricted SSH access in EC2 using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Security Groups:**
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - In the navigation pane, choose "Security Groups" under the "Network & Security" section.

2. **Select the Security Group:**
   - Identify and select the security group associated with your EC2 instance that you want to modify.

3. **Edit Inbound Rules:**
   - In the "Inbound rules" tab, click on the "Edit inbound rules" button.
   - Locate the rule that allows SSH (port 22) access.

4. **Restrict SSH Access:**
   - Modify the SSH rule to restrict access. Instead of allowing access from "0.0.0.0/0" (which allows access from any IP address), specify a more restrictive IP range or a specific IP address that should have SSH access.
   - Click "Save rules" to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you can ensure that SSH access to your EC2 instances is restricted to only trusted IP addresses, thereby enhancing the security of your instances.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent unrestricted SSH access to EC2 instances using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Security Group:**
   First, identify the security group associated with your EC2 instance. You can list all security groups and find the relevant one using the following command:
   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query "SecurityGroups[*].{ID:GroupId,Name:GroupName}"
   ```

2. **Check Existing Rules:**
   Check the existing inbound rules for the identified security group to see if there are any rules allowing unrestricted SSH access (port 22 from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0).
   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query "SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions"
   ```

3. **Revoke Unrestricted SSH Access:**
   If you find any rules allowing unrestricted SSH access, revoke them. Replace `<security-group-id>` with your actual security group ID.
   ```sh
   aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
   aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr ::/0
   ```

4. **Add Restricted SSH Access:**
   Add a more restrictive rule to allow SSH access only from specific IP addresses or IP ranges. Replace `<your-ip-range>` with the specific IP range you want to allow.
   ```sh
   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr <your-ip-range>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that SSH access to your EC2 instances is restricted to specific IP addresses, thereby preventing unrestricted SSH access.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent unrestricted SSH access in EC2 using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Install Boto3 Library**:
   Ensure you have the Boto3 library installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by creating a `~/.aws/credentials` file.

3. **Create a Python Script to Modify Security Groups**:
   Write a Python script to find and update security groups that allow unrestricted SSH access (port 22). The script will revoke any inbound rules that allow SSH access from `0.0.0.0/0`.

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to apply the changes.

Here is a sample Python script to prevent unrestricted SSH access:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize a session using Amazon EC2
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Describe all security groups
response = ec2.describe_security_groups()

# Iterate over each security group
for sg in response['SecurityGroups']:
    group_id = sg['GroupId']
    group_name = sg['GroupName']
    
    # Iterate over each inbound rule
    for permission in sg['IpPermissions']:
        if permission['IpProtocol'] == 'tcp' and permission['FromPort'] == 22 and permission['ToPort'] == 22:
            for ip_range in permission['IpRanges']:
                if ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                    print(f"Revoking unrestricted SSH access for Security Group: {group_name} ({group_id})")
                    
                    # Revoke the rule
                    ec2.revoke_security_group_ingress(
                        GroupId=group_id,
                        IpProtocol='tcp',
                        FromPort=22,
                        ToPort=22,
                        CidrIp='0.0.0.0/0'
                    )

print("Unrestricted SSH access has been revoked where applicable.")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialize Boto3 Client**:
   ```python
   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
   ```
   This initializes the EC2 client using Boto3.

2. **Describe Security Groups**:
   ```python
   response = ec2.describe_security_groups()
   ```
   This retrieves all security groups in your AWS account.

3. **Iterate and Check for Unrestricted SSH Access**:
   The script iterates over each security group and its inbound rules to check if there is a rule allowing SSH access from `0.0.0.0/0`.

4. **Revoke Unrestricted SSH Access**:
   If such a rule is found, the script revokes it using the `revoke_security_group_ingress` method.

By running this script, you can ensure that no security group in your AWS account allows unrestricted SSH access, thereby enhancing the security of your EC2 instances.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the left navigation pane, under the "Network & Security" section, click on "Security Groups".
3. In the Security Groups page, you will see a list of all the security groups associated with your EC2 instances. Click on the security group that you want to check.
4. In the details pane at the bottom, click on the "Inbound" tab. Here, you can see all the inbound rules for the selected security group. If there is a rule that allows SSH (port 22) access from '0.0.0.0/0' or '::/0', it means unrestricted SSH access is allowed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all security groups: The first step to detect unrestricted SSH access is to list all the security groups in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following command: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query "SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId]" --output text`

3. Check security group rules: For each security group, you need to check the inbound rules to see if any of them allow unrestricted SSH access. You can do this by running the following command for each security group: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query "SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions[*].{FromPort:FromPort,ToPort:ToPort,IpRanges:IpRanges}" --output text`

4. Detect unrestricted SSH access: If any security group has an inbound rule that allows SSH (port 22) access from 0.0.0.0/0, then it means that unrestricted SSH access is allowed. You can detect this by looking at the output of the previous command. If you see an entry with FromPort and ToPort both set to 22 and IpRanges set to 0.0.0.0/0, then it means that unrestricted SSH access is allowed.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   First, you need to install Boto3. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3`. After installing Boto3, you need to configure it. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. Import necessary libraries and establish a session:
   You need to import the Boto3 library and establish a session with AWS. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ec2 = session.resource('ec2')
   ```

3. Get all security groups and check for unrestricted SSH access:
   You can get all security groups using the `security_groups` function and then check if they allow unrestricted SSH access. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   for security_group in ec2.security_groups.all():
       for permission in security_group.ip_permissions:
           if permission['FromPort'] == 22 and permission['ToPort'] == 22:
               for ip_range in permission['IpRanges']:
                   if ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                       print(f"Security Group {security_group.id} allows unrestricted SSH access.")
   ```

4. Run the script:
   Save the script in a file, for example, `check_ssh.py`, and then run it using the command `python check_ssh.py`. If there are any security groups that allow unrestricted SSH access, their IDs will be printed on the console.

Please replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your actual AWS access key and secret key.

7. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, the unrestricted SSH access misconfiguration will be remediated and the instance(s) will be more secure.

#
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate unrestricted SSH access in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the security groups in your AWS account:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups
```

3. Identify the security group that allows unrestricted SSH access. You can look for a security group that has a rule allowing SSH traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 (any IP address) or ::/0 (any IPv6 address).

4. Once you have identified the security group, note down its Group ID.

5. Run the following command to revoke the SSH access rule from the security group:

```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

Replace `<security-group-id>` with the Group ID of the security group that allows unrestricted SSH access.

6. Verify that the SSH access rule has been revoked by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>
```

Replace `<security-group-id>` with the Group ID of the security group that allows unrestricted SSH access.

7. Repeat the above steps for all the security groups in your AWS account to ensure that SSH access is not allowed from any unauthorized IP addresses.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the unrestricted SSH access issue in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDKs and libraries in your Python script. You will need to import the `boto3` library to interact with AWS services.

```
import boto3
```

2. Create a client session for EC2 using `boto3.client()`. 

```
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Use the `describe_security_groups()` method to retrieve all the security groups in your AWS account.

```
security_groups = ec2.describe_security_groups()
```

4. Loop through each security group and check if it has any inbound rules allowing SSH access from any IP address (`0.0.0.0/0`).

```
for sg in security_groups['SecurityGroups']:
    for rule in sg['IpPermissions']:
        if rule['IpProtocol'] == 'tcp' and rule['FromPort'] <= 22 and rule['ToPort'] >= 22:
            for ip_range in rule['IpRanges']:
                if ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                    print(f"Security group {sg['GroupId']} allows unrestricted SSH access.")
```

5. If any security group is found to have unrestricted SSH access, use the `revoke_security_group_ingress()` method to remove the rule allowing SSH access from any IP address.

```
ec2.revoke_security_group_ingress(
    GroupId=sg['GroupId'],
    IpPermissions=[
        {
            'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
            'FromPort': 22,
            'ToPort': 22,
            'IpRanges': [
                {
                    'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
```

6. Run the Python script to remediate the unrestricted SSH access issue in your AWS account.

Note: Make sure to run the script with appropriate AWS credentials and permissions.
