1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the left navigation pane, under the "Network & Security" section, click on "Security Groups".
3. In the Security Groups page, you will see a list of all the security groups associated with your EC2 instances. Click on the security group that you want to check.
4. In the details pane at the bottom, click on the "Inbound" tab. Here, you can see all the inbound rules for the selected security group. If there is a rule that allows SSH (port 22) access from '0.0.0.0/0' or '::/0', it means unrestricted SSH access is allowed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all security groups: The first step to detect unrestricted SSH access is to list all the security groups in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following command: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query "SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId]" --output text`

3. Check security group rules: For each security group, you need to check the inbound rules to see if any of them allow unrestricted SSH access. You can do this by running the following command for each security group: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query "SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions[*].{FromPort:FromPort,ToPort:ToPort,IpRanges:IpRanges}" --output text`

4. Detect unrestricted SSH access: If any security group has an inbound rule that allows SSH (port 22) access from 0.0.0.0/0, then it means that unrestricted SSH access is allowed. You can detect this by looking at the output of the previous command. If you see an entry with FromPort and ToPort both set to 22 and IpRanges set to 0.0.0.0/0, then it means that unrestricted SSH access is allowed.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   First, you need to install Boto3. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3`. After installing Boto3, you need to configure it. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. Import necessary libraries and establish a session:
   You need to import the Boto3 library and establish a session with AWS. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ec2 = session.resource('ec2')
   ```

3. Get all security groups and check for unrestricted SSH access:
   You can get all security groups using the `security_groups` function and then check if they allow unrestricted SSH access. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   for security_group in ec2.security_groups.all():
       for permission in security_group.ip_permissions:
           if permission['FromPort'] == 22 and permission['ToPort'] == 22:
               for ip_range in permission['IpRanges']:
                   if ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                       print(f"Security Group {security_group.id} allows unrestricted SSH access.")
   ```

4. Run the script:
   Save the script in a file, for example, `check_ssh.py`, and then run it using the command `python check_ssh.py`. If there are any security groups that allow unrestricted SSH access, their IDs will be printed on the console.

Please replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your actual AWS access key and secret key.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the unrestricted SSH access misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 service.
3. Select the EC2 instance(s) that have unrestricted SSH access.
4. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Networking" and then "Change Security Groups".
5. In the "Change Security Groups" window, select the security group associated with the instance(s) and click "Edit".
6. In the "Edit inbound rules" window, locate the SSH rule (port 22) and remove it or restrict it to only allow traffic from specific IP addresses or ranges.
7. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, the unrestricted SSH access misconfiguration will be remediated and the instance(s) will be more secure.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate unrestricted SSH access in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the security groups in your AWS account:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups
```

3. Identify the security group that allows unrestricted SSH access. You can look for a security group that has a rule allowing SSH traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 (any IP address) or ::/0 (any IPv6 address).

4. Once you have identified the security group, note down its Group ID.

5. Run the following command to revoke the SSH access rule from the security group:

```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

Replace `<security-group-id>` with the Group ID of the security group that allows unrestricted SSH access.

6. Verify that the SSH access rule has been revoked by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>
```

Replace `<security-group-id>` with the Group ID of the security group that allows unrestricted SSH access.

7. Repeat the above steps for all the security groups in your AWS account to ensure that SSH access is not allowed from any unauthorized IP addresses.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the unrestricted SSH access issue in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDKs and libraries in your Python script. You will need to import the `boto3` library to interact with AWS services.

```
import boto3
```

2. Create a client session for EC2 using `boto3.client()`. 

```
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Use the `describe_security_groups()` method to retrieve all the security groups in your AWS account.

```
security_groups = ec2.describe_security_groups()
```

4. Loop through each security group and check if it has any inbound rules allowing SSH access from any IP address (`0.0.0.0/0`).

```
for sg in security_groups['SecurityGroups']:
    for rule in sg['IpPermissions']:
        if rule['IpProtocol'] == 'tcp' and rule['FromPort'] <= 22 and rule['ToPort'] >= 22:
            for ip_range in rule['IpRanges']:
                if ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                    print(f"Security group {sg['GroupId']} allows unrestricted SSH access.")
```

5. If any security group is found to have unrestricted SSH access, use the `revoke_security_group_ingress()` method to remove the rule allowing SSH access from any IP address.

```
ec2.revoke_security_group_ingress(
    GroupId=sg['GroupId'],
    IpPermissions=[
        {
            'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
            'FromPort': 22,
            'ToPort': 22,
            'IpRanges': [
                {
                    'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
```

6. Run the Python script to remediate the unrestricted SSH access issue in your AWS account.

Note: Make sure to run the script with appropriate AWS credentials and permissions.
