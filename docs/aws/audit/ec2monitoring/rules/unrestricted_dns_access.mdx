1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the EC2 dashboard, select "Security Groups" under the "Network & Security" section.
3. In the Security Groups page, select the security group you want to inspect for unrestricted DNS access.
4. In the details pane at the bottom, check the "Inbound" and "Outbound" rules. If there are any rules that allow unrestricted (0.0.0.0/0) access to port 53 (DNS), then unrestricted DNS access is allowed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all security groups: The first step to detect unrestricted DNS access is to list all the security groups in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following command: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query "SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId]" --output text`

3. Check security group rules: For each security group, you need to check the inbound and outbound rules. You can do this by running the following command for each security group: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>`. Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group you want to check.

4. Detect unrestricted DNS access: In the output of the previous command, look for rules that allow unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) to port 53 (DNS). If such a rule exists, then unrestricted DNS access is allowed. The rule will look something like this:

```
{
    "IpProtocol": "tcp",
    "FromPort": 53,
    "ToPort": 53,
    "IpRanges": [
        {
            "CidrIp": "0.0.0.0/0"
        }
    ]
}
```

If you find such a rule, then the security group allows unrestricted DNS access.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You will need the boto3 library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can configure credentials by using the AWS CLI or by directly placing them in the ~/.aws/credentials file. 

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. Python Script: Now, you can use the following Python script to check if unrestricted DNS access is allowed in EC2. This script retrieves all security groups and checks if they have inbound rules that allow unrestricted (0.0.0.0/0) access to port 53 (DNS).

   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

   def check_unrestricted_dns_access():
       security_groups = ec2.security_groups.all()
       for sg in security_groups:
           for permission in sg.ip_permissions:
               for ip_range in permission['IpRanges']:
                   if ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0' and permission['FromPort'] <= 53 and permission['ToPort'] >= 53:
                       print(f"Security Group {sg.id} allows unrestricted DNS access")

   check_unrestricted_dns_access()
   ```

4. Run the Script: Finally, run the script using your Python interpreter. If there are any security groups that allow unrestricted DNS access, their IDs will be printed to the console. If no output is produced, then no such security groups were found.

   ```bash
   python check_dns_access.py
   ```
   
Remember, this script only checks for unrestricted access over IPv4. If your security groups also include IPv6 ranges, you would need to modify the script to also check the 'Ipv6Ranges' field in the ip_permissions.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the unrestricted DNS access issue in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to the AWS console and navigate to the Route 53 service.
2. Click on the Hosted Zones option in the left-hand menu.
3. Select the hosted zone for which you want to restrict DNS access.
4. Click on the "Create Record Set" button to create a new record set.
5. In the "Name" field, enter the domain name for which you want to restrict DNS access.
6. In the "Type" field, select the appropriate DNS record type (such as A, CNAME, etc.).
7. In the "Value" field, enter the IP address or domain name of the resource that the DNS record should point to.
8. Scroll down to the "Routing Policy" section and select "Simple" routing policy.
9. In the "Alias" section, select "No" to disable the alias feature.
10. Click on the "Create" button to create the record set.

By following these steps, you have created a new DNS record set that restricts access to the specified resource. Only authorized users will be able to access the resource through the DNS record.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the unrestricted DNS access issue in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the Route 53 hosted zones in your account:

   ```
   aws route53 list-hosted-zones
   ```

3. Identify the hosted zone that has unrestricted DNS access and make a note of its ID.

4. Run the following command to update the hosted zone to restrict DNS access:

   ```
   aws route53 update-hosted-zone-Comment \
   --id <hosted-zone-id> \
   --comment "Restricted DNS Access"
   ```

   Note: Replace `<hosted-zone-id>` with the ID of the hosted zone identified in step 3.

5. Run the following command to verify that the hosted zone has been updated:

   ```
   aws route53 get-hosted-zone \
   --id <hosted-zone-id>
   ```

   Note: Replace `<hosted-zone-id>` with the ID of the hosted zone identified in step 3.

6. Verify that the DNS access has been restricted by checking the DNS settings in the AWS Management Console.

   Note: The DNS access should now be restricted to authorized users only.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the unrestricted DNS access misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Connect to the AWS account using the Boto3 library in Python.
2. Get a list of all Route53 hosted zones using the `list_hosted_zones()` method.
3. For each hosted zone, get a list of all the record sets using the `list_resource_record_sets()` method.
4. Check each record set for any entries that have an empty or wildcard `Name` field and an `A` or `CNAME` record type.
5. If any such record sets are found, remove them using the `change_resource_record_sets()` method.

Here's a sample Python code that implements the above steps:

```python
import boto3

# Connect to AWS account
client = boto3.client('route53')

# Get a list of all hosted zones
response = client.list_hosted_zones()
hosted_zones = response['HostedZones']

# Loop through each hosted zone
for zone in hosted_zones:
    zone_id = zone['Id']
    zone_name = zone['Name']

    # Get a list of all record sets in the zone
    response = client.list_resource_record_sets(HostedZoneId=zone_id)
    record_sets = response['ResourceRecordSets']

    # Loop through each record set
    for record_set in record_sets:
        # Check if the record set has an empty or wildcard name and an A or CNAME record type
        if (record_set['Name'] == '' or record_set['Name'].startswith('*.')) and \
           (record_set['Type'] == 'A' or record_set['Type'] == 'CNAME'):
            # Remove the record set
            change_batch = {
                'Changes': [
                    {
                        'Action': 'DELETE',
                        'ResourceRecordSet': record_set
                    }
                ]
            }
            client.change_resource_record_sets(HostedZoneId=zone_id, ChangeBatch=change_batch)
```

Note: This code only removes the record sets that match the criteria mentioned in step 4. You may want to modify it to suit your specific requirements. Also, make sure to test the code thoroughly before running it in a production environment.
