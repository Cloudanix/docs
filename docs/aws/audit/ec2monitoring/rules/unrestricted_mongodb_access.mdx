How to update security group inbound configuration to restrict MongoDB Database access to specific entities?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. Select the security group that is associated with your MongoDB instance.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Unrestricted MongoDB Access Should Not Be Allowed" Policy.)
3. In the inbound rules section, locate the rule that allows access to the MongoDB port (default is 27017).
4. Edit the rule and change the source IP address to the specific IP addresses or CIDR blocks that you want to allow access from. 
Note: It is recommended to use CIDR blocks instead of individual IP addresses to allow access to a group of entities.
5. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.
6. Verify that the changes have been applied by testing the connectivity to the MongoDB instance from the allowed entities.
