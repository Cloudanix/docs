1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, select 'Security Groups' under the 'Network & Security' section.
3. In the 'Security Groups' page, select the security group associated with your MySQL instance.
4. In the 'Inbound rules' tab, check for any rules that allow unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0) to MySQL port (default 3306). If such a rule exists, it indicates that unrestricted MySQL access is allowed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all security groups: The first step to detect unrestricted MySQL access is to list all the security groups in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following command: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query "SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId]" --output text`

3. Check for unrestricted access: For each security group, you need to check if it allows unrestricted access to MySQL (port 3306). You can do this by running the following command for each security group: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query "SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions[*].{FromPort:FromPort,ToPort:ToPort,IpRanges:IpRanges[*].CidrIp}" --output text`

4. Analyze the output: If the output of the above command includes '0.0.0.0/0' for the CIDR IP and '3306' for the FromPort or ToPort, then the security group allows unrestricted MySQL access. If not, then the security group does not allow unrestricted MySQL access.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   First, you need to install Boto3. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3`. After installing Boto3, you need to configure it. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. Get a list of all EC2 instances:
   You can use the `describe_instances()` function to get a list of all EC2 instances. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   response = ec2.describe_instances()

   for reservation in response["Reservations"]:
       for instance in reservation["Instances"]:
           print(instance["InstanceId"])
   ```

3. Check the security groups of each EC2 instance:
   For each EC2 instance, you need to check its security groups. You can do this by using the `describe_security_groups()` function. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   response = ec2.describe_security_groups()

   for security_group in response["SecurityGroups"]:
       print(security_group["GroupId"])
   ```

4. Check if MySQL access is unrestricted:
   For each security group, you need to check if it allows unrestricted MySQL access. You can do this by checking if the security group has an inbound rule that allows TCP traffic on port 3306 from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   response = ec2.describe_security_groups()

   for security_group in response["SecurityGroups"]:
       for ip_permission in security_group["IpPermissions"]:
           for ip_range in ip_permission["IpRanges"]:
               if ip_permission["IpProtocol"] == "tcp" and ip_permission["FromPort"] == 3306 and ip_permission["ToPort"] == 3306 and (ip_range["CidrIp"] == "0.0.0.0/0" or ip_range["CidrIpv6"] == "::/0"):
                   print("Unrestricted MySQL access detected in security group " + security_group["GroupId"])
   ```
   
This script will print the ID of each security group that allows unrestricted MySQL access.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the unrestricted MySQL access issue in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to AWS console.
2. Go to the RDS service.
3. Select the DB instance with unrestricted MySQL access.
4. Click on the "Modify" button.
5. Scroll down to the "Network & Security" section.
6. In the "Security Group" section, select the security group associated with the DB instance.
7. Click on the "Remove" button to remove the inbound rule that allows unrestricted access to MySQL.
8. Add a new inbound rule to the security group that allows access only from specific IP addresses or CIDR blocks.
9. Click on the "Save Changes" button to apply the changes.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the unrestricted MySQL access issue in AWS and ensure that your database is secure.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the unrestricted MySQL access issue in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to list all the security groups in your AWS account:
```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups
```
Step 2: Identify the security group that has unrestricted MySQL access. You can filter the results using the following command:
```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=ip-permission.protocol,Values=tcp Name=ip-permission.to-port,Values=3306 Name=ip-permission.cidr,Values='0.0.0.0/0'
```
This command will list all the security groups that have unrestricted MySQL access.

Step 3: Once you have identified the security group, run the following command to revoke the MySQL access:
```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 3306 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```
Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group that you want to remediate.

Step 4: Verify that the MySQL access has been revoked by running the following command:
```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>
```
This command will list the details of the security group that you have remediated.

That's it. You have successfully remediated the unrestricted MySQL access issue in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate unrestricted MySQL access in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Create an AWS client for the RDS service:

```
rds = boto3.client('rds')
```

3. Get a list of all RDS instances:

```
try:
    response = rds.describe_db_instances()
    instances = response['DBInstances']
except ClientError as e:
    print(e)
    exit(1)
```

4. Loop through each RDS instance and modify its security group to remove unrestricted MySQL access:

```
for instance in instances:
    db_instance_identifier = instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']
    db_security_groups = instance['DBSecurityGroups']
    for security_group in db_security_groups:
        if security_group['DBSecurityGroupName'] == 'default':
            try:
                response = rds.revoke_db_security_group_ingress(
                    DBSecurityGroupName='default',
                    EC2SecurityGroupId=security_group['EC2SecurityGroups'][0]['EC2SecurityGroupId'],
                    CIDRIP='0.0.0.0/0',
                    DBProtocol='tcp',
                    DBPortNumber=3306
                )
                print(f"Revoked unrestricted MySQL access for {db_instance_identifier}")
            except ClientError as e:
                print(e)
                exit(1)
```

This code will loop through each RDS instance and its associated security groups. If the default security group is found, it will revoke any inbound rules that allow unrestricted MySQL access (i.e. from any IP address). The code will print a message for each instance where unrestricted MySQL access was revoked.
