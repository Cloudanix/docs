2. Click on the "Security Groups" option in the left-hand menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Unrestricted MySQL Access Should Not Be Allowed" Policy.)
3. Select the security group that needs to be updated.
4. Click on the "Inbound Rules" tab.

6. Change the source of the rule to the specific entities that should have access to MySQL (e.g. IP addresses or security group IDs).

8. Click the "Save" button to apply the changes.
