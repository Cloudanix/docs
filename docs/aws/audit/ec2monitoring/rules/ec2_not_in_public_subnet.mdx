1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under the "NETWORK & SECURITY" section, click on "Subnets". This will display a list of all the subnets in your AWS environment.
3. Click on the subnet ID that you want to check. This will open the details page for that subnet.
4. In the details page, look for the "Auto-assign public IPv4 address" setting. If this setting is enabled, it means that any EC2 instance launched in this subnet will automatically be assigned a public IP address, indicating that the EC2 instance is in a public subnet.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Once you have AWS CLI installed and configured, you can start using it to interact with your AWS services.

2. To check if an EC2 instance is in a public subnet, you first need to list all the instances in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with information about all your EC2 instances.

3. Next, you need to identify the subnet of each instance. You can do this by parsing the JSON output from the previous command. Look for the "SubnetId" field in the output. This field contains the ID of the subnet that the instance is in.

4. Once you have the subnet ID, you can check if it's a public subnet by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-subnets --subnet-ids <subnet-id>
   ```
   Replace `<subnet-id>` with the ID of the subnet you want to check. This command will return a JSON output with information about the subnet. Look for the "MapPublicIpOnLaunch" field in the output. If this field is set to "true", then the subnet is a public subnet. If it's set to "false", then the subnet is a private subnet.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3, AWS EC2, and more. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```
After installation, you need to configure it. You can do this in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```
This will prompt you for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, AWS Region. These are used to make programmatic calls to AWS from your machine.

2. Use Boto3 to interact with AWS EC2: You can use Boto3 to create, configure, and manage AWS services using Python script. Here is a simple script to list all EC2 instances in a specific region:

```python
import boto3

def list_instances(region):
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2', region_name=region)
    for instance in ec2.instances.all():
        print(instance.id, instance.state)

list_instances('us-west-1')
```

3. Check if EC2 instance is in a public subnet: You can check if an EC2 instance is in a public subnet by checking the 'PublicIpAddress' attribute of the instance. If this attribute is not None, then the instance is in a public subnet.

```python
import boto3

def check_public_subnet(region):
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2', region_name=region)
    for instance in ec2.instances.all():
        if instance.public_ip_address is not None:
            print(f"Instance {instance.id} is in a public subnet")

check_public_subnet('us-west-1')
```

4. Check if EC2 instance has a public IP address: You can also check if an EC2 instance has a public IP address by checking the 'PublicIpAddress' attribute of the instance. If this attribute is not None, then the instance has a public IP address.

```python
import boto3

def check_public_ip(region):
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2', region_name=region)
    for instance in ec2.instances.all():
        if instance.public_ip_address is not None:
            print(f"Instance {instance.id} has a public IP address")

check_public_ip('us-west-1')
```

These scripts will help you detect if an EC2 instance is in a public subnet or has a public IP address.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the EC2 instance in a public subnet in AWS, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the VPC dashboard.

2. Select the VPC containing the public subnet that the EC2 instance is in.

3. Select the Subnets tab and then select the public subnet that the EC2 instance is in.

4. Select the Route Table tab and then select the route table associated with the public subnet.

5. Remove the route that allows traffic to the internet gateway. This will prevent any traffic from the internet from reaching the EC2 instance.

6. Create a new route table and associate it with the public subnet.

7. Add a route to the new route table that allows traffic to reach the internet gateway. This will allow any traffic from the EC2 instance to reach the internet.

8. Launch a new EC2 instance in a private subnet and associate it with the new route table. This will ensure that the EC2 instance is not accessible from the internet.

9. Terminate the old EC2 instance in the public subnet.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having an EC2 instance in a public subnet in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of having an EC2 instance in a public subnet in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the public subnet in which the EC2 instance is running. You can do this by checking the subnet's route table and confirming that it has a route to an Internet Gateway.

2. Create a new private subnet in the same VPC as the public subnet. This new subnet should have a non-overlapping CIDR block and should not have a route to an Internet Gateway.

3. Stop the EC2 instance that is running in the public subnet.

4. Modify the instance's network interface to move it from the public subnet to the new private subnet. You can do this using the following command:

```
aws ec2 modify-network-interface-attribute --network-interface-id <network-interface-id> --subnet-id <new-private-subnet-id>
```

Replace `<network-interface-id>` with the ID of the network interface attached to the EC2 instance, and `<new-private-subnet-id>` with the ID of the new private subnet you created.

5. Start the EC2 instance.

6. Verify that the EC2 instance now has a private IP address in the new private subnet and does not have a public IP address. You can do this by checking the instance's network interface settings.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of an EC2 instance in a public subnet in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to identify the EC2 instances that are in the public subnet. You can do this by using the `describe_instances` method of the `boto3` library in Python.

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.describe_instances(
    Filters=[
        {
            'Name': 'subnet-id',
            'Values': [
                'subnet-0123456789abcdef0',
            ]
        },
    ]
)

for reservation in response['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        print(instance['InstanceId'])
```

Replace the `subnet-id` with the ID of the public subnet.

2. Once you have identified the instances, you need to move them to a private subnet. To do this, you can modify the network interface of the instance and attach it to a private subnet. You can use the `modify_network_interface_attribute` method of the `boto3` library to do this.

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.modify_network_interface_attribute(
    NetworkInterfaceId='eni-0123456789abcdef0',
    Groups=[
        'sg-0123456789abcdef0',
    ],
    Description={
        'Value': 'Modified description'
    }
)

print(response)
```

Replace the `NetworkInterfaceId` with the ID of the network interface of the instance that you want to modify. Also, replace the `sg-0123456789abcdef0` with the ID of the security group that you want to attach to the network interface.

3. After modifying the network interface, you need to verify that the instance is now in the private subnet. You can do this by checking the `SubnetId` attribute of the instance using the `describe_instances` method.

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.describe_instances(
    InstanceIds=[
        'i-0123456789abcdef0',
    ],
)

for reservation in response['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        print(instance['SubnetId'])
```

Replace the `i-0123456789abcdef0` with the ID of the instance that you want to check.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of an EC2 instance in a public subnet in AWS using Python.
