1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the EC2 dashboard, click on "AMIs" under the "Images" section in the left-hand navigation pane.
3. Here, you will see a list of all the AMIs available in your account. Each AMI has a "Creation Date" associated with it.
4. To check if the AMI age exceeds the configured age, compare the "Creation Date" of each AMI with the current date. If the difference exceeds the configured age, then the AMI has a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by using the command `pip install awscli`. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account using `aws configure` command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all AMIs: Use the following command to list all the AMIs available in your account. This command will return a JSON object containing all the AMIs.
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-images --owners self
   ```

3. Extract the creation date: From the JSON object returned in the previous step, you can extract the creation date of each AMI using the `jq` command. The following command will return the creation date of each AMI.
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-images --owners self | jq -r '.Images[] | .CreationDate'
   ```

4. Compare the creation date with the current date: Now, you can compare the creation date of each AMI with the current date to check if the AMI age exceeds the configured age. You can do this using a simple script. Here is an example of how you can do it in Python.
   ```python
   import datetime
   import subprocess

   # Get the current date
   current_date = datetime.datetime.now()

   # Get the creation date of each AMI
   command = "aws ec2 describe-images --owners self | jq -r '.Images[] | .CreationDate'"
   creation_dates = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True)

   # Compare the creation date with the current date
   for creation_date in creation_dates.split('\n'):
       creation_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(creation_date, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')
       age = (current_date - creation_date).days
       if age > configured_age:
           print("AMI age exceeds the configured age")
   ```
   Replace `configured_age` with the age you have configured.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Import the necessary libraries: You will need the boto3 library, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc.

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

2. Create a session using your AWS credentials. Replace 'aws_access_key_id', 'aws_secret_access_key', and 'region_name' with your AWS credentials and the region you want to check.

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Create an EC2 resource object using the session from step 2. Then, get all the AMIs owned by your account.

```python
ec2_resource = session.resource('ec2')
images = ec2_resource.images.filter(Owners=['self'])
```

4. Iterate over the images and check the creation date of each AMI. If the creation date is older than the configured age, print the AMI ID. Replace 'configured_age' with the maximum age you want for your AMIs.

```python
for image in images:
    creation_date = image.creation_date
    creation_date = datetime.strptime(creation_date, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ")
    if creation_date < datetime.now() - timedelta(days=configured_age):
        print(f"AMI {image.id} is older than the configured age.")
```

This script will print the IDs of all AMIs that are older than the configured age.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
The AMI age should not exceed the configured age is a common misconfiguration in AWS. You can remediate this issue by following the below steps:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
3. Click on the "AMIs" option from the left-hand navigation panel.
4. Identify the AMI which has exceeded the configured age.
5. Select the AMI and click on the "Actions" button.
6. Choose the "Deregister" option from the drop-down list.
7. Confirm the deregistration by clicking on the "Deregister" button in the confirmation dialog box.
8. Once the AMI is deregistered, you can create a new AMI with the latest updates and configurations.

By following these steps, you can remediate the AMI age misconfiguration in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the "AMI Age Should Not Exceed the Configured Age" misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. First, identify the AMIs that have exceeded the configured age by running the below command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-images --owners self --query 'Images[?CreationDate<=`<configured_age>`].[ImageId,CreationDate]' --output text
   ```

   Note: Replace `<configured_age>` with the age limit in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`.

2. Once you have identified the AMIs, you can deregister them using the below command:

   ```
   aws ec2 deregister-image --image-id <image_id>
   ```

   Note: Replace `<image_id>` with the ID of the AMI that you want to deregister.

3. Finally, to automate this process, you can create a Lambda function that runs the above commands on a scheduled basis to ensure that AMIs do not exceed the configured age limit.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the AMI Age misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow the steps below:

1. Identify the misconfigured AMIs by checking their age against the configured age.

2. Create a Lambda function in AWS that uses the Boto3 library to identify the misconfigured AMIs.

3. Use the EC2 client in Boto3 to get a list of all the AMIs in your AWS account.

4. Loop through the list of AMIs and check the age of each one against the configured age.

5. If an AMI is older than the configured age, deregister it using the EC2 client.

6. Set up a CloudWatch event to trigger the Lambda function at a regular interval to ensure that all misconfigured AMIs are remediated in a timely manner.

Here's some sample Python code that can be used to identify and deregister misconfigured AMIs:

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Set the configured age of AMIs in days
configured_age = 30

# Create an EC2 client
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Get a list of all the AMIs in the account
response = ec2.describe_images(Owners=['self'])

# Loop through the list of AMIs and check their age
for image in response['Images']:
    creation_date = datetime.strptime(image['CreationDate'], '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')
    age_in_days = (datetime.now() - creation_date).days
    if age_in_days > configured_age:
        # Deregister the AMI
        ec2.deregister_image(ImageId=image['ImageId'])
```

Note: This is just a sample code and it may need to be modified based on your specific requirements. Also, make sure to test the code thoroughly before running it in a production environment.
