How to ensure age of AMIs is not more than the configured days.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Config service.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "AMI Age Should Not Exceed the Configured Age" Policy.)
2. In the AWS Config console, click on "Rules" in the left navigation pane.
3. Click on the "Add rule" button to create a new rule.
4. In the "Add rule" wizard, select the "AWS managed rule" option.
5. Search for and select the "ec2-image-age-check" rule. This rule checks the age of EC2 images (AMIs).
6. Configure the rule parameters:
   - Specify the maximum age in days for the AMI using the "maximumAgeInDays" parameter.
   - Choose whether to include or exclude shared AMIs by selecting the appropriate option.
   - Optionally, specify tags to include or exclude specific AMIs based on tags.
7. Review the rule configuration and click on the "Save" button to create the rule.
8. AWS Config will start evaluating your environment against the rule. After evaluation, you will see the compliance status of your AMIs based on their age.
9. To view the non-compliant AMIs, go to the "Resources" tab in the AWS Config console and filter the results by the "ec2-image-age-check" rule.
10. If any AMIs are found to exceed the configured age, review them and take appropriate action, such as removing or updating them.
