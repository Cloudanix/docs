### Remediation

How to update security groups inbound configuration in order to restrict NetBIOS access to specific entities?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the EC2 service by selecting "EC2" from the services menu.
3. In the EC2 dashboard, click on "Security Groups" in the left navigation pane.
4. Identify the security group(s) that have unrestricted NetBIOS access.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Unrestricted Netbios Access Should Not Be Allowed" Policy.)
5. Take note of the specific security group identifier(s) that need remediation.
6. Select the checkbox next to the security group(s) you want to remediate.
7. Above the list of security groups, click on the "Actions" button.
8. In the dropdown menu, click on "Edit inbound rules" or "Edit outbound rules" based on your requirement.
   - If the unrestricted NetBIOS access is in the inbound rules, select "Edit inbound rules".
   - If the unrestricted NetBIOS access is in the outbound rules, select "Edit outbound rules".
9. In the rule editor, locate the rule that allows unrestricted NetBIOS access.
   - NetBIOS typically uses ports 137 (UDP), 138 (UDP), and 139 (TCP).
10. Select the rule that allows NetBIOS access and click on the "Delete" or "Remove" button to remove the rule.
11. Review the remaining rules to ensure that the necessary and secure access is maintained.
12. Click on the "Save rules" or "Save" button to apply the changes to the security group.
13. Monitor the status of the rule update to ensure it is successfully applied to the security group(s).
14. Repeat these steps for each security group that has unrestricted NetBIOS access until all groups have been remediated.
