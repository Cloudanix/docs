<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of FSx not having a backup plan in EC2 using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Backup Plan:**
   First, create a backup plan using the AWS Backup service. This plan will define the backup rules and schedules.

   ```sh
   aws backup create-backup-plan --backup-plan '{
       "BackupPlanName": "MyFSxBackupPlan",
       "Rules": [
           {
               "RuleName": "DailyBackup",
               "TargetBackupVaultName": "Default",
               "ScheduleExpression": "cron(0 12 * * ? *)",
               "StartWindowMinutes": 60,
               "CompletionWindowMinutes": 180,
               "Lifecycle": {
                   "MoveToColdStorageAfterDays": 30,
                   "DeleteAfterDays": 365
               }
           }
       ]
   }'
   ```

2. **Assign Resources to the Backup Plan:**
   Assign the FSx file system to the backup plan by creating a backup selection.

   ```sh
   aws backup create-backup-selection --backup-plan-id <your-backup-plan-id> --backup-selection '{
       "SelectionName": "MyFSxBackupSelection",
       "IamRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::<your-account-id>:role/service-role/AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole",
       "Resources": [
           "arn:aws:fsx:<region>:<account-id>:file-system/<fsx-id>"
       ]
   }'
   ```

3. **Enable Backup for FSx:**
   Ensure that the FSx file system is configured to allow backups. This can be done by setting the `Backup` parameter when creating or modifying the FSx file system.

   ```sh
   aws fsx create-file-system --file-system-type WINDOWS --storage-capacity 300 --subnet-ids subnet-12345678 --windows-configuration '{
       "ThroughputCapacity": 8,
       "WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime": "1:05:00",
       "DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime": "05:00",
       "AutomaticBackupRetentionDays": 7,
       "CopyTagsToBackups": true
   }'
   ```

4. **Verify Backup Configuration:**
   Verify that the backup plan and selection are correctly configured and associated with the FSx file system.

   ```sh
   aws backup list-backup-plans
   aws backup list-backup-selections --backup-plan-id <your-backup-plan-id>
   aws backup list-protected-resources
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your FSx file systems have a proper backup plan in place, thereby preventing the misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of FSx (Amazon FSx) not having a backup plan in EC2 using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have the `boto3` library installed, which is the AWS SDK for Python. You can install it using pip if you haven't already.

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### Step 2: Set Up AWS Credentials
Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by setting environment variables.

```bash
aws configure
```

### Step 3: Create a Python Script to Check and Create Backup Plans

Here's a Python script that checks for existing FSx file systems and ensures they have a backup plan. If a backup plan does not exist, it creates one.

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError

def ensure_fsx_backup():
    try:
        # Initialize a session using Amazon FSx
        session = boto3.Session()
        fsx_client = session.client('fsx')
        backup_client = session.client('backup')

        # List all FSx file systems
        file_systems = fsx_client.describe_file_systems()
        
        for fs in file_systems['FileSystems']:
            fs_id = fs['FileSystemId']
            print(f"Checking backup plan for FSx FileSystem: {fs_id}")

            # Check if a backup plan exists for the FSx file system
            backup_plans = backup_client.list_backup_plans()
            backup_plan_exists = False

            for plan in backup_plans['BackupPlansList']:
                plan_id = plan['BackupPlanId']
                plan_details = backup_client.get_backup_plan(BackupPlanId=plan_id)
                for rule in plan_details['BackupPlan']['Rules']:
                    if 'ResourceType' in rule and rule['ResourceType'] == 'FSx':
                        backup_plan_exists = True
                        break

            if not backup_plan_exists:
                print(f"No backup plan found for FSx FileSystem: {fs_id}. Creating a new backup plan.")
                # Create a backup plan
                backup_plan = {
                    'BackupPlanName': f'FSxBackupPlan-{fs_id}',
                    'Rules': [
                        {
                            'RuleName': 'DailyBackup',
                            'TargetBackupVaultName': 'Default',
                            'ScheduleExpression': 'cron(0 12 * * ? *)',  # Daily at 12:00 UTC
                            'StartWindowMinutes': 60,
                            'CompletionWindowMinutes': 180,
                            'Lifecycle': {
                                'MoveToColdStorageAfterDays': 30,
                                'DeleteAfterDays': 365
                            },
                            'RecoveryPointTags': {
                                'CreatedBy': 'FSxBackupScript'
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }

                response = backup_client.create_backup_plan(BackupPlan=backup_plan)
                print(f"Backup plan created: {response['BackupPlanId']}")

    except (NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError) as e:
        print("Error: AWS credentials not found or incomplete.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ensure_fsx_backup()
```

### Step 4: Run the Script
Execute the script to ensure all FSx file systems have a backup plan.

```bash
python ensure_fsx_backup.py
```

### Summary
1. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure `boto3` is installed.
2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**: Configure your AWS credentials.
3. **Create a Python Script**: Write a script to check and create backup plans for FSx file systems.
4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to enforce backup plans.

This script will help you automate the process of ensuring that all FSx file systems have a backup plan, thereby preventing the misconfiguration.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon FSx console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "File systems". This will display a list of all your FSx file systems.

3. Select the FSx file system you want to check for backup plan. 

4. In the details pane, look for the "Backups" section. If there are no backups listed or the backup frequency is not as per your organization's policy, then it indicates that the FSx does not have a proper backup plan.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all FSx file systems: Use the following command to list all the FSx file systems in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws fsx describe-file-systems
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the FSx file systems.

3. Check backup policy: For each FSx file system, check if it has a backup policy. This can be done by using the following command:

   ```
   aws fsx describe-backup-policy --file-system-id <file-system-id>
   ```
   Replace `<file-system-id>` with the ID of the FSx file system you want to check. This command will return a JSON output with the details of the backup policy.

4. Analyze the output: If the backup policy is not enabled or not configured properly, then the FSx file system is misconfigured. You need to manually analyze the output of the above command to determine this. If the `WindowsConfiguration` field is null or the `AutomaticBackupRetentionDays` is less than the desired value, then the FSx file system is misconfigured.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3, AWS EC2, and more. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```
After installation, you need to configure it. You can do this in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```
This will prompt you for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, AWS Region. These are required for Boto3 to interact with AWS services.

2. Import the necessary libraries and create an AWS FSx client:

```python
import boto3

fsx = boto3.client('fsx')
```
3. Use the `describe_backups` function to retrieve information about the backups of your FSx file systems:

```python
response = fsx.describe_backups()

for backup in response['Backups']:
    print('BackupId: ', backup['BackupId'])
    print('Lifecycle: ', backup['Lifecycle'])
    print('Type: ', backup['Type'])
    print('ProgressPercent: ', backup['ProgressPercent'])
    print('CreationTime: ', backup['CreationTime'])
    print('KmsKeyId: ', backup['KmsKeyId'])
    print('ResourceARN: ', backup['ResourceARN'])
    print('Tags: ', backup['Tags'])
```
4. Analyze the output: The script will print out the details of each backup. If a file system does not have a backup, it means it is misconfigured. You can modify the script to raise an alert or take other actions when it detects a file system without a backup.
