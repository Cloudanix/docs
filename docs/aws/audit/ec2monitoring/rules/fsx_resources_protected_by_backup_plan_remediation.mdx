### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon FSx console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "File systems". This will display a list of all your FSx file systems.

3. Select the FSx file system you want to check. This will open the details page for the selected file system.

4. In the "Backups" section, check if there is a backup plan in place. If there are no backups listed or the backup frequency is not as per your organization's policy, then it is a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, make sure you have AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions. You can install it using pip:
   
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Then configure it using:
   
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be asked to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all FSx file systems: Use the following command to list all FSx file systems in your account:

   ```
   aws fsx describe-file-systems
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details about all your FSx file systems.

3. Check backup policy: Unfortunately, AWS CLI does not provide a direct command to check the backup policy of FSx file systems. However, you can use the output from the previous command to manually check if a backup policy is set for each file system. Look for the "AutomaticBackupRetentionDays" field in the output. If it's set to 0, it means no backup plan is set.

4. Use a script to automate the process: Since manually checking each file system can be tedious, especially if you have many, you can use a Python script to automate the process. Here is a simple script that uses the boto3 library to check the backup policy of all FSx file systems:

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('fsx')

   response = client.describe_file_systems()

   for fs in response['FileSystems']:
       if fs['AutomaticBackupRetentionDays'] == 0:
           print(f"File system {fs['FileSystemId']} does not have a backup plan.")
   ```
   This script will print the ID of each file system that does not have a backup plan.

#### Using Python

To check if FSx has a backup plan in EC2 using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to directly interact with AWS services, including FSx. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary libraries**: You need to import Boto3, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python.

    ```python
    import boto3
    ```

2. **Create a session**: You need to create a session using your AWS credentials.

    ```python
    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
        region_name='YOUR_REGION_NAME'
    )
    ```

3. **Create an FSx client**: Use the session to create an FSx client.

    ```python
    fsx = session.client('fsx')
    ```

4. **Check for backup plans**: Use the FSx client to list all the file systems and check if they have a backup plan. If a file system does not have a backup plan, print its ID.

    ```python
    response = fsx.describe_file_systems()
    for file_system in response['FileSystems']:
        backups_response = fsx.describe_backups(
            Filters=[
                {
                    'Name': 'file-system-id',
                    'Values': [
                        file_system['FileSystemId'],
                    ]
                },
            ]
        )
        if not backups_response['Backups']:
            print(f"File system {file_system['FileSystemId']} does not have a backup plan.")
    ```

This script will print the IDs of all FSx file systems that do not have a backup plan. Please replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', and 'YOUR_REGION_NAME' with your actual AWS credentials and region name.

   - Select the backup plan that you just created from the dropdown menu and click on the "Associate" button to assign the backup plan to the FSx file system.

6. **Verify Backup Plan**:
   - Once the backup plan is associated with the FSx file system, verify that the backup plan is active and running as expected.
   - Monitor the backup status and ensure that backups are being taken according to the defined schedule.

By following these steps, you will successfully remediate the misconfiguration of FSx not having a backup plan for your AWS EC2 instances using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of not having a backup plan for FSx on AWS EC2 using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI:**
   If you haven't already installed and configured the AWS CLI, you can do so by following the instructions provided in the AWS documentation: [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).

2. **Enable Backup for FSx File Systems:**
   You can enable backup for your FSx file systems using the AWS CLI by running the following command:
   ```
   aws fsx update-file-system --file-system-id fs-1234567890abcdef0 --backup-id backup-0abcdef1234567890 --windows-configuration AutomaticBackupRetentionDays=30,ThroughputCapacity=8
   ```
   Replace `fs-1234567890abcdef0` with the ID of your FSx file system and `backup-0abcdef1234567890` with the ID of the backup you want to associate with the file system. You can adjust the `AutomaticBackupRetentionDays` and `ThroughputCapacity` values as needed.

3. **Verify Backup Configuration:**
   To ensure that backup has been successfully enabled for your FSx file system, you can run the following command:
   ```
   aws fsx describe-file-systems --file-system-ids fs-1234567890abcdef0
   ```
   This command will provide detailed information about your FSx file system, including its backup configuration.

4. **Automate Backup Scheduling (Optional):**
   If you want to automate the scheduling of backups for your FSx file system, you can create a backup policy using the AWS CLI. Here is an example command to create a backup policy:
   ```
   aws fsx create-backup-policy --file-system-id fs-1234567890abcdef0 --daily-backup-start-time 01:00:00 --automatic-backup-retention-days 30
   ```
   This command will create a backup policy for the specified file system that triggers a daily backup at 01:00:00 UTC and retains the backups for 30 days.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not having a backup plan for FSx on AWS EC2 using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of not having a backup plan for FSx in AWS, you can create a backup plan using Python Boto3 library. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this issue:

1. Install Boto3 library:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials:
   Ensure that you have configured your AWS credentials either by setting environment variables or using AWS CLI `aws configure` command.

3. Use the following Python script to create a backup plan for FSx in AWS EC2:

```python
import boto3

def create_fsx_backup_plan(fsx_id, backup_name):
    client = boto3.client('fsx')

    response = client.create_backup_plan(
        ClientRequestToken='string',
        Name=backup_name,
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'Name',
                'Value': backup_name
            },
        ],
        BackupPlan={
            'BackupPlanName': backup_name,
            'BackupPlanRules': [
                {
                    'RuleName': 'DailyBackup',
                    'ScheduleExpression': 'cron(0 0 * * ? *)',
                    'TargetBackupVault': 'string',
                    'StartWindowMinutes': 60,
                    'CompletionWindowMinutes': 60,
                    'Lifecycle': {
                        'DeleteAfterDays': 30
                    },
                    'CopyActions': [
                        {
                            'DestinationBackupVault': 'string'
                        },
                    ]
                },
            ]
        }
    )

    print("Backup plan created successfully with BackupPlanId:", response['BackupPlanId'])

# Replace 'fsx_id' with your FSx file system ID and 'backup_name' with the desired backup plan name
create_fsx_backup_plan('fs-1234567890abcdef0', 'MyBackupPlan')
```

4. Replace `'fsx_id'` with the FSx file system ID for which you want to create a backup plan, and `'backup_name'` with the desired name for the backup plan.

5. Run the Python script to create the backup plan for the specified FSx file system.

By following these steps and executing the Python script, you will be able to create a backup plan for FSx in AWS EC2, thereby remediating the misconfiguration of not having a backup plan.
