1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "Instances", click on "Instances".
3. In the "Instances" page, you will see a list of all your EC2 instances. Check the "Instance type" column for each instance.
4. If the instance type is not of the latest generation (for example, it starts with "t1", "m1", "m2", "c1", "cc1", "cg1", "cr1", "hs1", "m3", "c3", "r3", "i2", "d2"), then it is a misconfiguration as it is not using the latest generation instance type.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 instances: Use the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 describe-instances` to list all the EC2 instances in your account. This command will return a JSON output with details about all your EC2 instances.

3. Extract instance types and instance IDs: From the JSON output, you can extract the instance types and instance IDs using the command `aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId, InstanceType]' --output text`. This command will return a list of instance IDs and their corresponding instance types.

4. Check if instances are of the latest generation: Now, you need to manually check if the instance types returned in the previous step are of the latest generation or not. You can do this by referring to the official AWS documentation which lists all the latest generation instance types. If any of your instances are not of the latest generation, then it is a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the Boto3 library. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials: Before you can interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a file at ~/.aws/credentials. At the very least, the contents of the file should be:

   ```bash
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Create a Python script: The following script will list all EC2 instances and their instance types. It will then check if the instance type is of the latest generation or not.

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_ec2_instance_type():
       ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
       instances = ec2.instances.all()

       for instance in instances:
           instance_type = instance.instance_type
           print(f'Instance ID: {instance.id}, Instance Type: {instance_type}')

           if not instance_type.startswith('m5') and not instance_type.startswith('c5'):
               print(f'Instance {instance.id} is not using the latest generation instance type.')

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       check_ec2_instance_type()
   ```
   This script assumes that m5 and c5 are the latest generation instance types. You should replace these with the actual latest generation instance types.

4. Run the Python script: You can run the Python script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python check_ec2_instance_type.py
   ```
   
This script will print out the instance ID and instance type of all EC2 instances. If an instance is not using the latest generation instance type, it will print a warning message.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Instances Should Use Latest Generation" for AWS using AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Login to your AWS console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Click on the "Instances" option from the left-hand side menu.
4. Identify the instances that are not using the latest generation.
5. Stop the instances by selecting them and clicking on the "Instance State" option from the top menu, then selecting "Stop".
6. Once the instances are stopped, select them again and click on the "Actions" button from the top menu, then select "Instance Settings" and "Change Instance Type".
7. Select the latest generation instance type from the list and click on "Apply".
8. Start the instances again by selecting them and clicking on the "Instance State" option from the top menu, then selecting "Start".

After completing these steps, your EC2 instances will be using the latest generation.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Instances Should Use Latest Generation" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the EC2 instances in your AWS account:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances
```

3. Identify the instances that are not using the latest generation.

4. Stop the instance using the following command:

```
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```

Make sure to replace `<instance-id>` with the actual ID of the instance that needs to be stopped.

5. Once the instance is stopped, update the instance type to the latest generation using the following command:

```
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --instance-type <instance-type>
```

Replace `<instance-id>` with the actual ID of the instance that needs to be updated, and `<instance-type>` with the latest generation instance type.

6. Start the instance using the following command:

```
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```

Make sure to replace `<instance-id>` with the actual ID of the instance that needs to be started.

7. Verify that the instance is running and using the latest generation instance type.

Repeat the above steps for all the instances that are not using the latest generation.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the EC2 Instances Should Use Latest Generation misconfiguration for AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify all the EC2 instances running in your AWS account that are not using the latest generation.

2. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to create a list of all the instances that are not using the latest generation.

3. Use the Boto3 EC2 client to stop the instances that are not using the latest generation.

4. Use the Boto3 EC2 client to modify the instance type to the latest generation.

5. Use the Boto3 EC2 client to start the instances again.

Here is a sample Python code that can be used to remediate the EC2 Instances Should Use Latest Generation misconfiguration in AWS:

```python
import boto3

# Create a Boto3 EC2 client
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Get a list of all the instances in the account
response = ec2.describe_instances()

# Loop through all the instances and check if they are using the latest generation
for reservation in response['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        instance_type = instance['InstanceType']
        latest_generation_instance_types = ['t3', 'm5', 'c5', 'r5']
        if not any(instance_type.startswith(prefix) for prefix in latest_generation_instance_types):
            instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
            # Stop the instance
            ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
            # Modify the instance type to the latest generation
            ec2.modify_instance_attribute(InstanceId=instance_id, Attribute='instanceType', Value='t3.micro')
            # Start the instance
            ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
```

Note: This code assumes that the latest generation instance type is `t3.micro`. You may need to modify the instance type value based on your specific requirements.
