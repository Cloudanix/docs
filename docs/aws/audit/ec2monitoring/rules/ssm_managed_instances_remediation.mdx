1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, select "Instances" to view all the EC2 instances.
3. For each instance, check the "Tags" section. If the instance is managed by SSM, it should have a tag with the key "SSM-Managed" and the value "True". If such a tag is not present, the instance is not managed by SSM.
4. Alternatively, you can navigate to the Systems Manager dashboard and select "Managed Instances" in the navigation pane. If an EC2 instance is not listed here, it is not managed by SSM.

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all EC2 instances: Use the AWS CLI command `describe-instances` to list all the EC2 instances in your account. This command will return a JSON output with the details of all your instances.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances
   ```
3. List all managed instances: Use the AWS CLI command `describe-instance-information` to list all the instances that are managed by SSM. This command will return a JSON output with the details of all your managed instances.

   ```
   aws ssm describe-instance-information
   ```
4. Compare the instances: Now, you need to compare the instances from step 2 and step 3. If there are instances in step 2 that are not present in step 3, those instances are not managed by SSM. You can do this comparison using a Python script or any other method you prefer.

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   To interact with AWS services, you need to install Boto3. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing Boto3, you need to configure it. You can do this by using the AWS CLI:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be asked to provide your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, which you can get from your AWS Management Console.

2. Import the necessary modules and create an EC2 resource object:
   You need to import Boto3 and create an EC2 resource object to interact with your EC2 instances.
   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
   ```

3. Get the list of all EC2 instances and check if they are managed by SSM:
   You can get the list of all EC2 instances using the `instances.all()` method. Then, for each instance, you can check if it is managed by SSM by checking if the `SSM:ManagedInstance` tag is present.
   ```python
   for instance in ec2.instances.all():
       tags = instance.tags
       is_managed_by_ssm = False
       for tag in tags:
           if tag['Key'] == 'SSM:ManagedInstance':
               is_managed_by_ssm = True
               break
       if not is_managed_by_ssm:
           print(f"Instance {instance.id} is not managed by SSM")
   ```

4. Handle exceptions:
   It's a good practice to handle exceptions in your script. You can do this by using a try-except block. For example, you can catch the `botocore.exceptions.NoCredentialsError` exception which is raised when Boto3 can't find your AWS credentials.
   ```python
   try:
       for instance in ec2.instances.all():
           # ...
   except botocore.exceptions.NoCredentialsError:
       print("No AWS credentials found")
   ```
   This way, if your script can't find your AWS credentials, it will print a helpful error message instead of a traceback.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Instances Should Be Managed By SSM" in AWS using the AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. Select the EC2 instance that needs to be managed by SSM.
3. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Instance Settings" and then click on "Attach/Replace IAM Role".
4. In the "Attach/Replace IAM Role" window, select the option "SSMManagedInstanceCore" in the "IAM Role" drop-down menu.
5. Click on "Apply" to attach the IAM role to the EC2 instance.
6. Once the IAM role is attached, navigate to the SSM dashboard.
7. Select "Managed Instances" from the left-hand menu.
8. Verify that the EC2 instance is listed as a managed instance. If it is not listed, select "Register instances" to add the EC2 instance to SSM.
9. After registering the instance, select the instance and click on "Actions" and then select "Run Command".
10. In the "Run a Command" window, select the "AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage" document.
11. In the "Command Parameters" section, select the "Install" option for the "action" parameter.
12. Click on "Run" to install the SSM agent on the EC2 instance.
13. Once the SSM agent is installed, the EC2 instance will be managed by SSM.

By following the above steps, the misconfiguration "EC2 Instances Should Be Managed By SSM" can be remediated for AWS using the AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Instances Should Be Managed By SSM" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine.

Step 2: Run the following command to identify the EC2 instances that are not managed by SSM:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value|[0], [not contains(Tags[?Key==`aws: ssm: managed`, Value==`true`)], InstanceId]]' --output text
```

Step 3: The above command will output a list of all EC2 instances that are not managed by SSM. Identify the instances that need to be remediated.

Step 4: Run the following command to enable SSM management for the identified EC2 instances:

```
aws ssm send-command --document-name "AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage" --document-version "1" --targets "Key=InstanceIds,Values=<Instance-ID>" --parameters '{"action":["Install"],"installationType":["Uninstall and reinstall"],"name":["AmazonCloudWatchAgent"],"version":["latest"]}' --timeout-seconds 600 --max-concurrency "50" --max-errors "0" --output-s3-bucket-name "<S3-Bucket-Name>" --output-s3-key-prefix "output" --region "<Region>"
```

Note: Replace `<Instance-ID>`, `<S3-Bucket-Name>`, and `<Region>` with the appropriate values.

Step 5: Repeat Step 4 for all the identified EC2 instances.

Step 6: Verify that SSM management is enabled for the EC2 instances by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value|[0], [not contains(Tags[?Key==`aws: ssm: managed`, Value==`true`)], InstanceId]]' --output text
```

The above command should not return any output, indicating that all EC2 instances are now managed by SSM.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Instances Should Be Managed By SSM" in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using pip: `pip install boto3`

2. Create an AWS SSM client object using the following code:

```python
import boto3

ssm_client = boto3.client('ssm')
```

3. Retrieve a list of all EC2 instances in the AWS account using the following code:

```python
import boto3

ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2_client.describe_instances()
instances = []

for reservation in response['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        instances.append(instance['InstanceId'])
```

4. For each EC2 instance, check if it is already managed by SSM using the following code:

```python
import boto3

ssm_client = boto3.client('ssm')

response = ssm_client.describe_instance_information(
    InstanceInformationFilterList=[
        {
            'key': 'InstanceIds',
            'valueSet': [
                'INSTANCE_ID'
            ]
        },
    ]
)

if len(response['InstanceInformationList']) > 0:
    print('Instance is already managed by SSM')
else:
    print('Instance is not managed by SSM')
```

Replace `INSTANCE_ID` with the ID of the EC2 instance you want to check.

5. If the EC2 instance is not already managed by SSM, you can remediate the misconfiguration by running the following command:

```python
import boto3

ssm_client = boto3.client('ssm')

response = ssm_client.send_command(
    InstanceIds=[
        'INSTANCE_ID',
    ],
    DocumentName='AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage',
    Parameters={
        'action': ['Install'],
        'name': ['AmazonCloudWatchAgent'],
    }
)

command_id = response['Command']['CommandId']
```

Replace `INSTANCE_ID` with the ID of the EC2 instance you want to remediate.

This command will install the Amazon CloudWatch agent on the EC2 instance and configure it to be managed by SSM. You can monitor the progress of the command using the `command_id` returned by the `send_command` method.
