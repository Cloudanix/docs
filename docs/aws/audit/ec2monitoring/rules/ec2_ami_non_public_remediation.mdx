### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose 'AMIs'. 

3. In the table, find the AMI that you want to check. The 'Visibility' column indicates whether the AMI is public or private. If the visibility is set to 'Public', then the AMI is publicly accessible.

4. For a more detailed view, select the AMI and then choose 'Permissions' from the 'Actions' dropdown. If 'All' is listed in the 'AMI Permissions' section, then the AMI is publicly accessible.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all AMIs: Use the `describe-images` command to list all AMIs. This command returns information about the AMIs available to you. Here is the command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-images --owners self
   ```

3. Check the permissions of each AMI: The `describe-image-attribute` command can be used to check the permissions of each AMI. If the `all` group has `read` permission, then the AMI is public. Here is the command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-image-attribute --image-id <image-id> --attribute launchPermission
   ```

4. Analyze the output: If the output of the above command includes a group with the value `all`, then the AMI is public. If not, the AMI is private. You need to repeat step 3 for each AMI listed in step 2.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the Boto3 library. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to interact with AWS services. You can configure it in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   Then, input your access key, secret access key, and default region when prompted.

3. Create a Python script: The script will use Boto3 to interact with the EC2 service, retrieve all AMIs, and check if they are public. Here is a simple script that does this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_public_amis():
       ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
       amis = ec2.images.filter(Owners=['self'])
       for ami in amis:
           if ami.public == True:
               print(f"AMI {ami.id} is public")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_public_amis()
   ```

   This script first creates a connection to the EC2 service. Then, it retrieves all AMIs owned by the account (Owners=['self']). For each AMI, it checks if it is public (ami.public == True). If it is, it prints a message with the AMI ID.

4. Run the script: You can run the script using the Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python check_public_amis.py
   ```

   The script will print a message for each public AMI it finds. If it doesn't print anything, it means that there are no public AMIs in your account.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the steps to remediate the issue of EC2 AMIs being public in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Login to your AWS console.

2. Go to the EC2 dashboard.

3. Click on the "AMIs" option in the left-hand menu.

4. Select the AMI that you want to remediate.

5. Click on the "Modify Image Permissions" button.

6. In the "Modify Image Permissions" dialog box, select "Private" as the new permission.

7. Click on the "Save" button to apply the new permission.

8. Repeat the above steps for all the public AMIs that you want to remediate.

9. Once you have changed the permissions for all the public AMIs, verify that they are no longer public by checking the "Permissions" column in the AMIs dashboard.

10. If any AMIs are still public, repeat the above steps for those AMIs.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the issue of EC2 AMIs being public in AWS and ensure that your AMIs are only accessible to authorized users.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 AMIs Should Not Be Public" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AWS account and open the AWS CLI.

2. Run the following command to check if there are any public AMIs in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-images --owners self --filters "Name=is-public,Values=true"
   ```

3. If there are any public AMIs, you can make them private by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 modify-image-attribute --image-id <image-id> --launch-permission "{\"Remove\": [{\"Group\":\"all\"}]}"
   ```

   Replace `<image-id>` with the ID of the AMI you want to make private.

4. After running the command, verify that the AMI is no longer public by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-images --owners self --filters "Name=image-id,Values=<image-id>" "Name=is-public,Values=false"
   ```

   Replace `<image-id>` with the ID of the AMI you just made private.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all public AMIs in your AWS account.

6. Once you have made all the necessary AMIs private, you can prevent future public AMIs by setting the default AMI permissions to private. Run the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 modify-image-attribute --attribute launchPermission --value "{\"Add\": [{\"Group\":\"self\"}]}" --image-id ami-00000000000000000
   ```

   Replace `ami-00000000000000000` with the ID of any private AMI in your account.

7. After running the command, verify that the default AMI permissions have been set to private by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-image-attribute --attribute launchPermission --image-id ami-00000000000000000
   ```

   Replace `ami-00000000000000000` with the ID of the AMI you used in step 6.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "EC2 AMIs Should Not Be Public" misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of EC2 AMIs being public in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Identify the public EC2 AMIs in your AWS account using boto3 library in Python. 

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.describe_images(
    Filters=[
        {
            'Name': 'is-public',
            'Values': [
                'true',
            ]
        },
    ]
)

for image in response['Images']:
    print('Public AMI ID: ' + image['ImageId'])
```

Step 2: Deregister the public EC2 AMIs using the `deregister_image()` method.

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.describe_images(
    Filters=[
        {
            'Name': 'is-public',
            'Values': [
                'true',
            ]
        },
    ]
)

for image in response['Images']:
    print('Deregistering public AMI ID: ' + image['ImageId'])
    ec2.deregister_image(ImageId=image['ImageId'])
```

Step 3: Modify the EC2 AMI permissions to make them private using the `modify_image_attribute()` method.

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.describe_images(
    Filters=[
        {
            'Name': 'is-public',
            'Values': [
                'true',
            ]
        },
    ]
)

for image in response['Images']:
    print('Making private AMI ID: ' + image['ImageId'])
    ec2.modify_image_attribute(
        ImageId=image['ImageId'],
        LaunchPermission={
            'Remove': [
                {
                    'Group': 'all',
                },
            ],
        },
    )
```

Note: Before making any changes to your AWS account, it is recommended to test the code in a non-production environment and ensure that it is working as expected.
