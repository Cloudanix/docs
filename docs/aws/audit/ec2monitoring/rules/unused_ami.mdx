<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "Images", click on "AMIs". This will display a list of all available AMIs.
3. To identify unused AMIs, check the "Launch Time" column. If an AMI hasn't been used for a long time, it's likely that it's unused.
4. Additionally, you can check the "Usage" column. If the value is "Not used", it means that the AMI is not associated with any running instances.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can install AWS CLI by following the instructions provided in the official AWS documentation. Once installed, you can configure it by running the command `aws configure` and providing your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all AMIs: You can list all the AMIs available in your AWS account by running the following command: `aws ec2 describe-images --owners self`. This command will return a JSON object containing details of all the AMIs owned by your AWS account.

3. Check for unused AMIs: To check for unused AMIs, you need to compare the list of AMIs obtained in the previous step with the list of AMIs currently in use by your EC2 instances. You can get the list of AMIs currently in use by running the following command: `aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].ImageId' --output text`. Any AMI that is in the first list but not in the second list is an unused AMI.

4. Filter unused AMIs: To make the process of identifying unused AMIs easier, you can use the `jq` command-line JSON processor. The following command will return a list of AMIs that are not in use: `aws ec2 describe-images --owners self | jq -r '.Images[].ImageId' | grep -v -f <(aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].ImageId' --output text)`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You can configure your AWS credentials in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI tool to store them in ~/.aws/credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

3. Write a Python script to list all AMIs: You can use the `describe_images` method from the EC2 client in Boto3 to list all AMIs. You can filter the AMIs by the owner to list only the AMIs owned by your account.

```python
import boto3

def list_amis():
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    response = ec2.describe_images(Owners=['self'])
    for image in response['Images']:
        print("Image ID: ", image['ImageId'])

list_amis()
```

4. Check if the AMIs are in use: To check if an AMI is in use, you can describe the instances in your account and check if the `ImageId` of any instance matches the `ImageId` of the AMI. If an AMI is not used by any instance, it is unused.

```python
def check_unused_amis():
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    amis = ec2.describe_images(Owners=['self'])
    instances = ec2.describe_instances()
    used_amis = set(instance['Instances'][0]['ImageId'] for instance in instances['Reservations'])
    for ami in amis['Images']:
        if ami['ImageId'] not in used_amis:
            print("Unused AMI: ", ami['ImageId'])

check_unused_amis()
```

This script will print the IDs of all unused AMIs.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the unused AMIs issue in AWS using AWS console:

1. Login to your AWS console.
2. Go to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Click on the "AMIs" option from the left-hand menu.
4. Sort the AMIs by the "Creation Date" column to identify the oldest and unused AMIs.
5. Select the unused AMIs that you want to remove.
6. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Deregister" from the dropdown menu.
7. Confirm the deregistration by clicking on the "Deregister" button in the confirmation window.
8. Once the AMI is deregistered, you can delete the associated EBS snapshots by selecting the AMI and clicking on the "Snapshots" tab.
9. Select the associated EBS snapshot(s) and click on the "Actions" button.
10. From the dropdown menu, select "Delete" and confirm the deletion.

By following these steps, you can remediate the unused AMIs issue in AWS and ensure that your cloud resources are optimized for cost and efficiency.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of unused AMIs in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI in your terminal or command prompt.

2. List all the AMIs that are not in use by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-images --owners self --filters "Name=state,Values=available" "Name=tag-key,Values=Name" --query 'Images[*].{ID:ImageId,Name:Tags[0].Value}'
```
This command will list all the AMIs that are not in use and have a Name tag.

3. Identify the AMIs that are not required anymore and make a note of their IDs.

4. Deregister the unused AMIs by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 deregister-image --image-id <AMI-ID>
```
Replace `<AMI-ID>` with the actual ID of the unused AMI.

5. Verify that the AMI has been deregistered by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-images --image-ids <AMI-ID>
```
Replace `<AMI-ID>` with the actual ID of the unused AMI. If the command returns an error stating that the AMI does not exist, then it has been successfully deregistered.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of unused AMIs in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the unused AMIs misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Boto3 library for Python using pip: `pip install boto3`

2. Create an AWS session using the `boto3.Session()` method.

3. Use the `ec2` resource in Boto3 to get a list of all the AMIs currently available in your AWS account. You can use the `filter()` method to filter out only the unused AMIs by checking their `state` attribute. For example:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session()

ec2 = session.resource('ec2')
unused_amis = []

for ami in ec2.images.filter(Owners=['self']):
    if ami.state == 'available' and len(ami.block_device_mappings) == 0:
        unused_amis.append(ami.id)
```

4. Once you have the list of unused AMIs, you can use the `deregister_image()` method to remove them from your AWS account. For example:

```python
for ami_id in unused_amis:
    ami = ec2.Image(ami_id)
    ami.deregister()
```

This will deregister all the unused AMIs in your AWS account. Make sure to test this code in a non-production environment before running it in a production environment.
