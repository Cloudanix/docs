<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, select "Instances" to open the instances dashboard.
3. Here, you can see all your instances. To check if an instance is idle, you need to monitor its CPU utilization. Select the instance you want to check, then click on the "Monitoring" tab.
4. In the Monitoring tab, you can see various metrics related to the instance. Look for the "CPU Utilization" metric. If the CPU Utilization is consistently low (close to 0%) over a long period of time, the instance might be idle.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by downloading the appropriate installer from the AWS CLI website. Once installed, you can configure it by running `aws configure` and providing your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all EC2 instances: Use the following command to list all EC2 instances in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId]' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all EC2 instance IDs.

3. Check CPU utilization: For each instance ID, you can check the CPU utilization using the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/EC2 --metric-name CPUUtilization --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=<instance-id> --start-time <start-time> --end-time <end-time> --period 3600 --statistics Maximum --unit Percent
   ```
   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance you want to check, and `<start-time>` and `<end-time>` with the time period you want to check. This command will return the maximum CPU utilization for the specified instance during the specified time period.

4. Analyze the results: If the CPU utilization is consistently low (for example, less than 10%) over a long period of time (for example, over a week), the instance may be idle. You may need to adjust the thresholds based on your specific use case.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You can use pip to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and other necessary libraries. Here is the command to install Boto3:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a file named `.aws/credentials` at the root of your user directory. The file should contain the following:

   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check for idle EC2 instances: Here is a simple Python script that uses Boto3 to check for idle EC2 instances:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a session using your AWS credentials
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )

   # Create an EC2 resource object using the session
   ec2_resource = session.resource('ec2')

   # Iterate over all your EC2 instances
   for instance in ec2_resource.instances.all():
       # Check the CPU utilization of the instance
       cloudwatch = session.client('cloudwatch')
       response = cloudwatch.get_metric_statistics(
           Namespace='AWS/EC2',
           MetricName='CPUUtilization',
           Dimensions=[
               {
                   'Name': 'InstanceId',
                   'Value': instance.id
               },
           ],
           StartTime=datetime.datetime.utcnow() - datetime.timedelta(seconds=600),
           EndTime=datetime.datetime.utcnow(),
           Period=300,
           Statistics=['Average']
       )
       # If the average CPU utilization is less than 1%, the instance is idle
       if response['Datapoints'] and response['Datapoints'][0]['Average'] < 1:
           print(f"Instance {instance.id} is idle")
   ```

4. Run the Python script: You can run the Python script using the following command:

   ```
   python check_idle_ec2.py
   ```

   This will print out the IDs of all idle EC2 instances.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
The best way to remediate this issue is to stop the idle instances. Here are the step by step instructions to remediate this issue in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Click on the EC2 service.
3. Select the instances that are idle.
4. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Instance State" and then click "Stop".
5. In the confirmation dialog box, click "Yes, Stop".
6. Wait for the instances to stop.
7. Once the instances have stopped, select them again.
8. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Instance Settings" and then click "Change Shutdown Behavior".
9. In the "Change Shutdown Behavior" dialog box, select "Terminate" and then click "Save".
10. Start the instances again when they are required.

By following these steps, you can remediate the EC2 instances that are idle in AWS and ensure that you are not being charged unnecessarily for instances that are not being used.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the EC2 Instances should not be idle misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the running instances in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --filters Name=instance-state-name,Values=running
   ```

3. Identify the idle instances that have been running for a long time and need to be remediated.

4. To stop the idle instances, run the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the idle instance that you want to stop.

5. Confirm the action by entering `y` when prompted.

6. After the instance has been stopped, you can start it again using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the stopped instance that you want to start.

7. Confirm the action by entering `y` when prompted.

8. Repeat steps 4-7 for any other idle instances that need to be remediated.

9. To prevent this misconfiguration from occurring in the future, you can set up CloudWatch alarms to monitor the CPU utilization of your instances and take action if it falls below a certain threshold.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of idle EC2 instances in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Create a Lambda function in Python that will identify and terminate idle EC2 instances. 

2. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to access the AWS EC2 service and retrieve the list of instances.

3. For each instance, check its CPU utilization using CloudWatch metrics. If the CPU utilization is below a certain threshold (e.g., 10%), then terminate the instance using the terminate_instances() method.

4. Schedule the Lambda function to run periodically using AWS CloudWatch Events. 

Here's a sample Python code to get you started:

```
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    cw = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
    idle_threshold = 10 # Set the idle threshold to 10%
    
    # Get a list of all running instances
    instances = ec2.describe_instances(
        Filters=[
            {'Name': 'instance-state-name', 'Values': ['running']}
        ]
    )
    
    # Check CPU utilization for each instance
    for reservation in instances['Reservations']:
        for instance in reservation['Instances']:
            instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
            cpu_utilization = cw.get_metric_statistics(
                Namespace='AWS/EC2',
                MetricName='CPUUtilization',
                Dimensions=[
                    {'Name': 'InstanceId', 'Value': instance_id}
                ],
                StartTime='2022-02-01T00:00:00Z',
                EndTime='2022-02-01T23:59:59Z',
                Period=3600,
                Statistics=['Average']
            )['Datapoints'][0]['Average']
            
            # Terminate idle instances
            if cpu_utilization < idle_threshold:
                ec2.terminate_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
                print(f"Terminated instance {instance_id}")
```

Note: This is just a sample code and you may need to modify it according to your specific requirements.
