How to remediate idle EC2 instances?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify Idle EC2 Instances:
   - Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
   - From the left navigation pane, click on "Instances" under the "Instances" section.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "EC2 Instances Should Not Be Idle" Policy.)
   - Review the list of existing EC2 instances and identify instances that are consistently experiencing low CPU utilization or minimal network traffic.
2. Analyze the Utilization:
   - Select the idle EC2 instance.
   - Click on the "Monitoring" tab to view the CPU and network utilization graphs over time.
   - Confirm that the instance is indeed idle and not just experiencing temporary low utilization.
3. Implement Remediation Measures:
   - Option 1: Stop the Instance:
     - If the idle instance is not required for immediate use, you can stop the instance to save costs.
     - Select the idle EC2 instance.
     - Click on the "Actions" button and choose "Instance State" > "Stop".
     - Confirm the action to stop the instance. This action will release the associated Elastic IP (if any) and free up resources.
   - Option 2: Schedule Auto Scaling:
     - If the idle period is predictable, you can set up an Auto Scaling schedule to automatically start and stop instances based on specific time intervals or demand patterns.
     - Create a new Auto Scaling group or modify an existing one to include the idle instance.
     - Configure the Auto Scaling group to start the instance during periods of expected activity and stop it during idle periods.
   - Option 3: Utilize Spot Instances or Reserved Instances:
     - Consider utilizing Spot Instances or Reserved Instances for workloads that are non-critical or have flexible scheduling requirements.
     - Spot Instances can provide significant cost savings, while Reserved Instances offer discounted pricing for longer-term commitments.
4. Monitor and Validate:
   - After implementing the remediation measures, monitor the performance and utilization of the EC2 instances to ensure that idle instances are effectively managed.
   - Regularly review your resource utilization, billing reports, and monitoring metrics to validate the impact of the remediation measures on cost savings.
