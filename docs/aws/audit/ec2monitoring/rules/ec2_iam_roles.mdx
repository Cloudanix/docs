### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard by clicking on "Services" at the top of the screen, then selecting "EC2" under the "Compute" category.
3. In the EC2 Dashboard, click on "Instances" in the left-hand navigation pane.
4. In the Instances screen, you will see a list of all your EC2 instances. For each instance, check the "IAM role" column. If the IAM role column is empty for an instance, it means that IAM roles are not being used for that EC2 instance.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the commands.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the EC2 instances in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId]' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all EC2 instance IDs.

3. For each instance ID, you can describe the instance attributes to check if an IAM role is associated with it. Run the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id> --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].IamInstanceProfile'
   ```
   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance you want to check. This command will return the IAM role associated with the instance, if any.

4. If the command returns `None` or no output, it means that the EC2 instance does not have an IAM role associated with it. This is a misconfiguration as it is a best practice to use IAM roles for EC2 instances to manage permissions.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. You can configure it in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws configure
   ```

   Then input your AWS credentials (Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, Default output format).

3. Write the Python script: The following Python script lists all EC2 instances and checks if they have an IAM role attached:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_ec2_iam_roles():
       ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
       instances = ec2.instances.all()

       for instance in instances:
           if instance.iam_instance_profile is None:
               print(f"EC2 instance {instance.id} does not have an IAM role attached.")
           else:
               print(f"EC2 instance {instance.id} has IAM role {instance.iam_instance_profile['Arn']} attached.")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_ec2_iam_roles()
   ```

4. Run the Python script: You can run the Python script using the following command:

   ```
   python check_ec2_iam_roles.py
   ```

   This will print out the ID of each EC2 instance and whether it has an IAM role attached. If an instance does not have an IAM role attached, it may be a misconfiguration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 IAM Roles Should Be Used" for AWS using the AWS console, please follow the below steps:

1. Login to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Select the EC2 instance for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.
4. Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Instance Settings" and then click on "Attach/Replace IAM Role".
5. In the "Attach/Replace IAM Role" window, select the IAM role that you want to attach to the EC2 instance.
6. Click on the "Apply" button to attach the selected IAM role to the EC2 instance.

By following the above steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "EC2 IAM Roles Should Be Used" for AWS. Now the EC2 instance is associated with an IAM role, which provides temporary security credentials to applications that run on the instance. This helps to improve the security of your AWS infrastructure by reducing the risk of unauthorized access to resources.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of not using EC2 IAM roles in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Create an IAM role with the required permissions that the EC2 instance needs. You can create this role using the AWS CLI command "aws iam create-role".

2. Attach the required policies to the IAM role. You can attach policies using the AWS CLI command "aws iam attach-role-policy".

3. Launch an EC2 instance and specify the IAM role created in step 1. You can do this using the AWS CLI command "aws ec2 run-instances" with the parameter "--iam-instance-profile".

4. Verify that the IAM role is being used by the EC2 instance by logging into the instance and running the command "curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/info". This command should return the IAM role ARN.

5. Once verified, you can remove any access keys that were previously used by the EC2 instance. You can do this using the AWS CLI command "aws ec2 delete-key-pair".

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of not using EC2 IAM roles in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of not using EC2 IAM roles in AWS, we can use the following steps using Python:

1. First, we need to create an IAM role that has the necessary permissions for our EC2 instances. We can do this using the boto3 library in Python. Here's an example:

```
import boto3

iam = boto3.client('iam')

response = iam.create_role(
    RoleName='EC2-Role',
    AssumeRolePolicyDocument={
        'Version': '2012-10-17',
        'Statement': [
            {
                'Effect': 'Allow',
                'Principal': {
                    'Service': 'ec2.amazonaws.com'
                },
                'Action': 'sts:AssumeRole'
            }
        ]
    }
)

# Attach necessary policies to the role
iam.attach_role_policy(
    RoleName='EC2-Role',
    PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess'
)
```

2. Once the IAM role is created, we can assign it to our EC2 instances. We can do this by launching new instances with the `--iam-instance-profile` parameter or by modifying existing instances with the `modify_instance_attribute` method in the `boto3` library.

```
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Launch new instances with IAM role
response = ec2.run_instances(
    ImageId='ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0',
    InstanceType='t2.micro',
    MinCount=1,
    MaxCount=1,
    IamInstanceProfile={
        'Arn': 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:instance-profile/EC2-Role'
    }
)

# Modify existing instances with IAM role
response = ec2.modify_instance_attribute(
    InstanceId='i-0123456789abcdef0',
    IamInstanceProfile={
        'Arn': 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:instance-profile/EC2-Role'
    }
)
```

By following these steps, we can remediate the misconfiguration of not using EC2 IAM roles in AWS using Python.
