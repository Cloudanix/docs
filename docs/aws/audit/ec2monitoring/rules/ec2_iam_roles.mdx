How to implement IAM role based access for existing instances?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions that you want to grant to the EC2 instances.
2. Stop the EC2 instances that you want to assign the IAM role to.
3. Go to the EC2 console, select the instance that you want to assign the IAM role to, and then choose "Actions" and then "Security" and then "Modify IAM Role".
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "EC2 IAM Roles Should Be Used" Policy.)
4. Select the IAM role that you created in step 1 and then choose "Apply".
5. Start the EC2 instances.
