How to remove any unnecessary or obsolete EC2 security groups from an AWS region?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
2. Click on the "Security Groups" option in the left-hand menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Security Group Excessive Counts" Policy.)
3. Review the list of security groups and identify any that are no longer needed or appear to be obsolete.
4. Select the security group(s) that you want to remove by clicking the checkbox next to each one.
5. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Delete security group" from the dropdown menu.
6. A confirmation window will appear. Click the "Yes, Delete" button to confirm the deletion.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 for any additional security groups that you want to remove.
8. Once you have removed all the unnecessary or obsolete security groups, verify that there are no instances still associated with the deleted security groups.
9. If there are instances associated with the deleted security groups, you will need to update their security group settings to remove the deleted security group(s).
