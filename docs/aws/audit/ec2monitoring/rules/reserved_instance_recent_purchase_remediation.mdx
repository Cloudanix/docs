<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent EC2 Reserved Instances recent purchases from being overlooked, you can set up automated monitoring and alerting using Python scripts. Here are the steps to achieve this:

### Step 1: Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)
First, ensure you have Boto3 installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

### Step 2: Configure AWS Credentials
Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can do this by setting up the `~/.aws/credentials` file or by using environment variables.

### Step 3: Write the Python Script
Create a Python script to fetch and review recent EC2 Reserved Instances purchases.

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize a session using Amazon EC2
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)

# Initialize EC2 client
ec2_client = session.client('ec2')

# Define the time range for recent purchases (e.g., last 7 days)
time_range = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=7)

def get_recent_reserved_instances():
    # Fetch all reserved instances
    response = ec2_client.describe_reserved_instances()
    reserved_instances = response['ReservedInstances']

    # Filter reserved instances purchased within the time range
    recent_purchases = [
        ri for ri in reserved_instances
        if ri['Start'] >= time_range
    ]

    return recent_purchases

def main():
    recent_purchases = get_recent_reserved_instances()
    if recent_purchases:
        print("Recent Reserved Instances Purchases:")
        for ri in recent_purchases:
            print(f"Reserved Instance ID: {ri['ReservedInstancesId']}, Start: {ri['Start']}")
    else:
        print("No recent Reserved Instances purchases found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 4: Automate the Script Execution
To ensure continuous monitoring, you can automate the execution of this script using a cron job (on Linux) or Task Scheduler (on Windows).

#### On Linux (using cron job):
1. Open the crontab editor:
    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```
2. Add a new cron job to run the script daily:
    ```bash
    0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py
    ```

#### On Windows (using Task Scheduler):
1. Open Task Scheduler and create a new task.
2. Set the trigger to run daily.
3. Set the action to start a program and point it to your Python executable and script path.

By following these steps, you can ensure that recent EC2 Reserved Instances purchases are regularly reviewed, helping to prevent any misconfigurations or overlooked purchases.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the EC2 dashboard, click on "Reserved Instances" in the left-hand navigation pane.
3. Here, you will see a list of all your reserved instances. Review the "Purchase Date" column to see when each reserved instance was purchased.
4. If there are any recent purchases that you do not recognize or that seem suspicious, you should investigate further. This could involve checking with the person who made the purchase, reviewing your AWS usage and cost reports, or contacting AWS support.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure to configure it with the necessary access keys and region.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the `describe-reserved-instances` command to list all your reserved instances. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances
   ```

3. This command will return a JSON output with all the details of your reserved instances. You can review this output to check the recent purchases. Look for the "Start" field in the output which indicates the date and time the Reserved Instance was purchased.

4. If you want to filter out the instances purchased within a specific time frame, you can use the `--query` option with the `describe-reserved-instances` command. For example, to list all the instances purchased in the last 30 days, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --query "ReservedInstances[?Start>=`date -v-30d`]"
   ```
   
   Please note that the date command used in the query is specific to Unix-like systems. You might need to adjust it according to your operating system.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up the AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, configure your AWS credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using the AWS CLI.

2. **Create a Python Script to Fetch EC2 Reserved Instances:**
   You can use the `describe_reserved_instances` method provided by the EC2 client in boto3 to fetch all the reserved instances. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def fetch_reserved_instances():
       ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
       response = ec2_client.describe_reserved_instances()
       return response['ReservedInstances']

   reserved_instances = fetch_reserved_instances()
   for instance in reserved_instances:
       print(instance)
   ```
   This script will print all the reserved instances along with their details.

3. **Filter Recent Purchases:**
   The response from `describe_reserved_instances` includes a `Start` field which indicates the time at which the reservation started. You can use this field to filter out the recent purchases. Here is how you can modify the above script to do this:

   ```python
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta
   import boto3

   def fetch_recent_reserved_instances(days):
       ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
       response = ec2_client.describe_reserved_instances()
       recent_instances = []
       for instance in response['ReservedInstances']:
           start_time = instance['Start']
           if start_time > datetime.now() - timedelta(days=days):
               recent_instances.append(instance)
       return recent_instances

   recent_instances = fetch_recent_reserved_instances(30)
   for instance in recent_instances:
       print(instance)
   ```
   This script will print all the reserved instances purchased in the last 30 days.

4. **Review the Recent Purchases:**
   Now that you have the recent purchases, you can review them based on your requirements. For example, you might want to check if the instance type matches your standard instance type, or if the instance is in the correct region. You can add these checks in the `fetch_recent_reserved_instances` function.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
The misconfiguration "EC2 Reserved Instances Recent Purchases Should Be Reviewed" typically refers to a situation where an AWS account has recently purchased EC2 Reserved Instances, but they are not being fully utilized. To remediate this, you can use the following steps:

1. Identify the underutilized EC2 Reserved Instances using the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) by calling the `describe_reserved_instances()` method of the EC2 client object. This method returns information about the specified Reserved Instances, including the number of instances that are currently in use.

```python
import boto3

ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

reserved_instances = ec2_client.describe_reserved_instances()
```

2. Filter the results to only include Reserved Instances that are not being fully utilized. You can do this by comparing the `InstanceCount` attribute to the `InstanceCount` attribute of the `State` object for each Reserved Instance.

```python
underutilized_instances = []

for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedInstances']:
    state = ec2_client.describe_reserved_instances_modifications(
        ReservedInstancesModificationIds=[reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']]
    )['ReservedInstancesModifications'][0]['TargetConfigurations'][0]['ReservedInstancesConfiguration']['Scope']

    if reserved_instance['InstanceCount'] > state['InstanceCount']:
        underutilized_instances.append(reserved_instance)
```

3. Review the list of underutilized EC2 Reserved Instances and take appropriate action. This could include modifying the instance type or family to better match your workload, or selling the underutilized Reserved Instances on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.

```python
for instance in underutilized_instances:
    print(f"Underutilized EC2 Reserved Instance: {instance['ReservedInstancesId']}")
```

By following these steps, you can identify and remediate underutilized EC2 Reserved Instances in your AWS account using Python and the boto3 SDK.
