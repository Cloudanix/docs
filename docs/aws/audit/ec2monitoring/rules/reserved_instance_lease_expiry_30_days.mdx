1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "RESOURCES", click on "Reserved Instances".
3. In the Reserved Instances page, you will see a list of all your reserved instances. Check the "End date" column for each of your reserved instances.
4. If the "End date" is within the next 30 days, then the Reserved Instance lease is expiring in the next 30 days.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```

   During the configuration process, you will be asked to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format. You can find these details in your AWS Management Console.

2. List all EC2 Reserved Instances: You can list all your EC2 Reserved Instances by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --filters Name=state,Values=active
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object that contains information about all your active Reserved Instances.

3. Parse the output: You can parse the output to get the end date of each Reserved Instance. The end date is contained in the `End` field of each Reserved Instance object. You can use a tool like `jq` to parse the JSON output. Here is an example command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --filters Name=state,Values=active | jq -r '.ReservedInstances[] | .End'
   ```

4. Check if the end date is within the next 30 days: You can write a script that checks if the end date of each Reserved Instance is within the next 30 days. Here is an example Python script:

   ```python
   import json
   import subprocess
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   command = ["aws", "ec2", "describe-reserved-instances", "--filters", "Name=state,Values=active"]
   output = subprocess.check_output(command)
   reserved_instances = json.loads(output)["ReservedInstances"]

   for ri in reserved_instances:
       end_date = datetime.strptime(ri["End"], "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ")
       if end_date <= datetime.now() + timedelta(days=30):
           print(f"Reserved Instance {ri['ReservedInstancesId']} will expire in the next 30 days.")
   ```

   This script runs the AWS CLI command to list all active Reserved Instances, parses the output, and checks if the end date of each Reserved Instance is within the next 30 days. If it is, it prints a message with the ID of the Reserved Instance.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to set up your AWS credentials. You can set your credentials for use by Boto3 in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI tool to configure them:

```bash
aws configure
```

3. Create a Python script to list all EC2 Reserved Instances and their expiration dates:

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Create a client
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Get the list of all reserved instances
reservations = ec2.describe_reserved_instances()['ReservedInstances']

# Get the current date
now = datetime.now()

# Check each reserved instance
for ri in reservations:
    # Get the end date of the reserved instance
    end_date = ri['End']
    
    # Calculate the difference between the end date and the current date
    diff = end_date - now
    
    # If the difference is less than 30 days, print the ID of the reserved instance
    if diff.days < 30:
        print("Reserved Instance ID: ", ri['ReservedInstancesId'])
```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using any Python interpreter. The script will print the IDs of all EC2 Reserved Instances that will expire in the next 30 days.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The "Reserved Instance Lease Expiration In The Next 30 Days" issue in AWS means that some of your Reserved Instances are about to expire. To remediate this issue, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open your terminal and ensure that you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS account credentials.

2. Run the following command to list all the Reserved Instances that are about to expire in the next 30 days:

```
aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --filters "Name=state,Values=active" "Name=product-description,Values=Linux/UNIX (Amazon VPC)" "Name=scope,Values=Availability Zone" --query 'ReservedInstances[?End <= `'"$(date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.000Z' -d '+30 days')"']'
```

This command will list all the active Reserved Instances that are running Linux/UNIX in Amazon VPC and are scoped to Availability Zone, and whose lease is expiring in the next 30 days.

3. Review the output and identify the Reserved Instances that you want to renew. Note down the Reserved Instance ID(s) that you want to renew.

4. Run the following command to purchase a new Reserved Instance with the same specifications and lease term as the expiring Reserved Instance:

```
aws ec2 purchase-reserved-instances-offering --instance-count [COUNT] --reserved-instances-offering-id [OFFERING_ID] --dry-run
```

Replace [COUNT] with the number of instances you want to reserve, [OFFERING_ID] with the ID of the offering that matches the expiring Reserved Instance, and --dry-run with --no-dry-run to actually purchase the Reserved Instance.

5. Verify that the new Reserved Instance is active and that the old Reserved Instance has been retired by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --reserved-instances-ids [OLD_INSTANCE_ID] [NEW_INSTANCE_ID]
```

Replace [OLD_INSTANCE_ID] with the ID of the expiring Reserved Instance and [NEW_INSTANCE_ID] with the ID of the newly purchased Reserved Instance.

6. Once you have verified that the new Reserved Instance is active, you can terminate the old Reserved Instance by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 modify-reserved-instances --reserved-instances-id [OLD_INSTANCE_ID] --target-configurations "InstanceCount=0"
```

Replace [OLD_INSTANCE_ID] with the ID of the expiring Reserved Instance.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the "Reserved Instance Lease Expiration In The Next 30 Days" issue in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of Reserved Instance Lease Expiration In The Next 30 Days in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

2. Create a connection to the AWS EC2 service:

```
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Retrieve the list of Reserved Instances with lease expiration dates within the next 30 days:

```
now = datetime.now()
filters = [{'Name': 'state', 'Values': ['active']},
           {'Name': 'instance-state-name', 'Values': ['running', 'stopped']},
           {'Name': 'end', 'Values': [str(now + timedelta(days=30)).split()[0]]}]
reserved_instances = ec2.describe_reserved_instances(Filters=filters)
```

4. For each Reserved Instance, check if its lease expiration date is within the next 30 days and if so, modify its lease to extend it:

```
for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedInstances']:
    end_date = datetime.strptime(reserved_instance['End'], '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')
    if (end_date - now).days <= 30:
        ec2.modify_reserved_instances(
            ReservedInstancesIds=[reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']],
            ClientToken=str(datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')),
            TargetConfigurations=[
                {
                    'AvailabilityZone': reserved_instance['AvailabilityZone'],
                    'InstanceCount': reserved_instance['InstanceCount'],
                    'InstanceType': reserved_instance['InstanceType'],
                    'Platform': reserved_instance['ProductDescription'],
                    'Scope': 'Availability Zone',
                    'Tenancy': reserved_instance['InstanceTenancy']
                }
            ]
        )
```

5. Run the Python script on a regular basis (e.g. daily) using a scheduler like cron to ensure that Reserved Instances are always extended before their lease expires.

Note: This code is provided as an example only and should be tested and modified to suit your specific requirements. It is also important to ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify Reserved Instances in your AWS account.
