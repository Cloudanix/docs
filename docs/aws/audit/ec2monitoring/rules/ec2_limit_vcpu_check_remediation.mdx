### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "INSTANCES", click on "Instances".
3. Select the EC2 instance that you want to check.
4. In the bottom panel, click on the "Monitoring" tab. Here, you can see the CloudWatch metrics for the selected instance.
5. Look for the "CPU Utilization" metric. If the CPU Utilization is consistently high or reaching the limit, it indicates that the EC2 instance is reaching its vCPU limit.

#### Using CLI

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you can start, make sure you have AWS CLI installed and configured on your system. You can install it using pip (Python package manager) with the command `pip install awscli`. After installation, you can configure it using `aws configure` command and provide your AWS credentials (Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, Default output format).

2. **List EC2 Instances**: Use the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 describe-instances` to list all the EC2 instances. This command will return a JSON output with all the details of your EC2 instances.

3. **Check vCPU for Each Instance**: For each instance, you need to check the vCPU usage. This information is not directly available from the EC2 instance description. You need to use the instance type to find out the vCPU limit. You can use the command `aws ec2 describe-instance-types --instance-types <instance-type>` to get the details of the instance type, which includes the vCPU limit.

4. **Compare vCPU Usage with Limit**: Finally, you need to compare the vCPU usage of each instance with its limit. This can be done by monitoring the CPU utilization of your instances. You can use the command `aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/EC2 --metric-name CPUUtilization --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=<instance-id> --start-time <start-time> --end-time <end-time> --period 3600 --statistics Maximum` to get the maximum CPU utilization for each instance. If the maximum CPU utilization is close to 100%, it means the instance is reaching its vCPU limit.

#### Using Python

1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, configure your AWS credentials. You can configure credentials by using the AWS CLI or by directly creating the credentials file. The default location for the file is `~/.aws/credentials`. At a minimum, the credentials file should specify the access key and secret access key.

2. **Import Necessary Libraries and Establish a Session:**
   Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS. You will need the EC2 resource from boto3.
   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ec2_resource = session.resource('ec2')
   ```

3. **Fetch EC2 Instances and Check vCPU Limit:**
   Fetch all the EC2 instances and check their vCPU limit. If the vCPU usage is at its limit, print the instance ID.
   ```python
   instances = ec2_resource.instances.all()

   for instance in instances:
       cpu_options = instance.cpu_options
       if cpu_options['CoreCount'] * cpu_options['ThreadsPerCore'] == instance.instance_type_info.vcpu_info.default_vcpus:
           print(f"Instance {instance.id} has reached its vCPU limit.")
   ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   Finally, run the script. It will print the IDs of all EC2 instances that have reached their vCPU limit. If no such instances are found, it will not print anything. This script can be scheduled to run at regular intervals to continuously monitor the vCPU usage of EC2 instances.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Instances Should Not Reach vCPU Limit" in AWS using the AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. Select the EC2 instance that is reaching the vCPU limit.
3. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Instance Settings" and then click on "Change Instance Type".
4. Select a larger instance type that provides more vCPUs than the current instance type.
5. Review the changes and click on "Apply".
6. Once the instance type is changed, the instance will have more vCPUs and the vCPU limit will no longer be reached.

Alternatively, you can also use AWS Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the instance type based on the resource utilization of the instance. This will ensure that the instance always has enough vCPUs and other resources to handle the workload.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the EC2 instances reaching vCPU limit misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.

Step 2: Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

Step 3: Use the below command to describe the EC2 instances that have reached the vCPU limit:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[?CpuOptions.CpuCreditsRemaining==`0`].{InstanceID:InstanceId, vCPUs:CpuOptions.CoreCount}'
```

This command will display the list of instances that have reached the vCPU limit.

Step 4: Stop the EC2 instances that have reached the vCPU limit using the below command:

```
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```

Replace the `<instance-id>` with the actual instance ID of the instance that you want to stop.

Step 5: Modify the instance type of the stopped instances using the below command:

```
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --instance-type <new-instance-type>
```

Replace `<instance-id>` with the actual instance ID of the instance that you want to modify, and `<new-instance-type>` with the desired instance type.

Step 6: Start the modified EC2 instances using the below command:

```
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```

Replace the `<instance-id>` with the actual instance ID of the instance that you want to start.

By following these steps, you can remediate the EC2 instances reaching vCPU limit misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the EC2 Instances reaching vCPU limit misconfiguration in AWS using python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Identify the EC2 instances which are reaching vCPU limit using the boto3 library in python.

```python
import boto3

# Create EC2 client
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Get all EC2 instances
reservations = ec2.describe_instances()

for reservation in reservations['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        # Check if the instance is running and has a vCPU limit
        if instance['State']['Name'] == 'running' and 'CpuOptions' in instance and 'CoreCount' in instance['CpuOptions']:
            # Check if the instance is reaching the vCPU limit
            if instance['CpuOptions']['CoreCount'] >= instance['CpuOptions']['ThreadsPerCore']:
                # Remediate the misconfiguration by stopping and starting the instance
                ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance['InstanceId']])
                ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance['InstanceId']])
```

Step 2: Stop and start the EC2 instances which are reaching the vCPU limit to remediate the misconfiguration.

```python
# Stop and start the instances which are reaching the vCPU limit
ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance['InstanceId']])
ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance['InstanceId']])
```

By following the above steps, you can remediate the EC2 Instances reaching vCPU limit misconfiguration in AWS using python.
