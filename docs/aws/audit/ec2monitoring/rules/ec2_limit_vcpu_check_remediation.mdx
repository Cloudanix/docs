How to check for vCPU-based EC2 instance limit?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the navigation panel, under INSTANCES, click Instances.

- Step 2: Click inside the EC2 attributes filter box located under the dashboard top menu, choose Instance Type from the dropdown list and select one of the instance types available in the list. This filtering method will help you to determine how many On-Demand instances are currently provisioned for the selected instance type. Repeat this step for the rest of the instance types available within the current AWS region.

- Step 3: In the left navigation panel, under Reports section, select Limits to access the page with the vCPU-based instance limits set for the AWS region.

- Step 4: On the Limits page, click Calculate vCPU limit to open the simplified vCPU calculator necessary to compute the total vCPU limit requirements for your AWS account.

- Step 5: On the Calculate vCPU limit page, use Add instance type button to add each instance type identified at step no. 3. Use Instance Count to set the number of EC2 instances available for each instance type found. Once all the instance types are added to the calculator, compare the value available in the vCPUs needed column (i.e. the total number of vCPUs in use) with the value defined in the Current limit column (i.e. the vCPU limit quota set for the AWS region). If the total number of vCPUs in use is going to reach soon the limit quota set for the current AWS region, follow the instructions provided in the Remediation/Resolution section to request a vCPU limit increase. Click Close to return to the Limits dashboard.
