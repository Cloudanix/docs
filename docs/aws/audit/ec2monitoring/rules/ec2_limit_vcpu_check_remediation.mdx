To prevent EC2 instances from reaching the vCPU limit in AWS using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Monitor vCPU Usage:**
   - Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
   - Select **Limits** from the left-hand menu under **Instances**.
   - Review the current vCPU usage and limits for your account. This will help you understand how close you are to reaching the limit.

2. **Set Up CloudWatch Alarms:**
   - Go to the **CloudWatch** service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Create a new alarm by selecting **Alarms** from the left-hand menu and then clicking **Create Alarm**.
   - Choose the **EC2** metric for vCPU usage and set a threshold to alert you when usage approaches the limit.

3. **Use Auto Scaling Groups:**
   - Navigate to the **Auto Scaling Groups** section under the **EC2 Dashboard**.
   - Create or modify an Auto Scaling Group to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand, ensuring that you do not exceed the vCPU limit.

4. **Request a vCPU Limit Increase:**
   - If you anticipate needing more vCPUs, go to the **Service Quotas** in the AWS Management Console.
   - Select **Amazon EC2** and then choose the vCPU limit.
   - Click on **Request quota increase** and submit the necessary details to request a higher vCPU limit for your account.

By following these steps, you can proactively manage and monitor your vCPU usage to prevent reaching the limit.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent EC2 instances from reaching the vCPU limit in AWS using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check Current vCPU Limits:**
   First, you need to check the current vCPU limits for your account in the specific region. This helps you understand your current usage and limits.

   ```sh
   aws service-quotas get-service-quota --service-code ec2 --quota-code L-1216C47A
   ```

2. **Monitor vCPU Usage:**
   Regularly monitor your vCPU usage to ensure you are not approaching the limit. You can use CloudWatch to set up alarms for this purpose.

   ```sh
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name "vCPUUsageAlarm" --metric-name "vCPUUsage" --namespace "AWS/EC2" --statistic "Sum" --period 300 --threshold 80 --comparison-operator "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold" --evaluation-periods 1 --alarm-actions "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyTopic"
   ```

3. **Request a vCPU Limit Increase:**
   If you are approaching your vCPU limit, you can request a limit increase through AWS Service Quotas.

   ```sh
   aws service-quotas request-service-quota-increase --service-code ec2 --quota-code L-1216C47A --desired-value 100
   ```

4. **Implement Auto Scaling:**
   Use Auto Scaling to manage your EC2 instances efficiently. This ensures that you are not over-provisioning or under-provisioning your instances, which can help in managing vCPU usage.

   ```sh
   aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --launch-configuration-name my-launch-config --min-size 1 --max-size 10 --desired-capacity 2 --vpc-zone-identifier subnet-12345678
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively prevent your EC2 instances from reaching the vCPU limit using the AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent EC2 instances from reaching the vCPU limit in AWS using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Monitor vCPU Usage:**
   Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to monitor the vCPU usage of your EC2 instances. This involves periodically checking the vCPU usage and comparing it with the limits.

   ```python
   import boto3

   def get_vcpu_usage():
       client = boto3.client('ec2')
       response = client.describe_instances()
       vcpu_count = 0
       for reservation in response['Reservations']:
           for instance in reservation['Instances']:
               instance_type = instance['InstanceType']
               instance_info = client.describe_instance_types(InstanceTypes=[instance_type])
               vcpu_count += instance_info['InstanceTypes'][0]['VCpuInfo']['DefaultVCpus']
       return vcpu_count

   def get_vcpu_limit():
       client = boto3.client('service-quotas')
       response = client.get_service_quota(
           ServiceCode='ec2',
           QuotaCode='L-1216C47A'
       )
       return response['Quota']['Value']

   current_vcpu_usage = get_vcpu_usage()
   vcpu_limit = get_vcpu_limit()

   if current_vcpu_usage >= vcpu_limit:
       print("Warning: vCPU usage is at or above the limit!")
   else:
       print("vCPU usage is within the limit.")
   ```

2. **Set Up Alarms:**
   Use Amazon CloudWatch to set up alarms that trigger when vCPU usage approaches the limit. This can be done programmatically using Boto3.

   ```python
   import boto3

   cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

   alarm = cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
       AlarmName='vCPUUsageAlarm',
       MetricName='CPUUtilization',
       Namespace='AWS/EC2',
       Statistic='Average',
       Period=300,
       EvaluationPeriods=1,
       Threshold=80.0,
       ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold',
       AlarmActions=[
           'arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:topic-name'
       ],
       Dimensions=[
           {
               'Name': 'InstanceId',
               'Value': 'i-1234567890abcdef0'
           },
       ]
   )
   ```

3. **Automate Scaling:**
   Use AWS Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on vCPU usage. This can be configured using Boto3.

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('autoscaling')

   response = client.put_scaling_policy(
       AutoScalingGroupName='my-auto-scaling-group',
       PolicyName='ScaleOutPolicy',
       PolicyType='TargetTrackingScaling',
       TargetTrackingConfiguration={
           'PredefinedMetricSpecification': {
               'PredefinedMetricType': 'ASGAverageCPUUtilization',
           },
           'TargetValue': 50.0,
       }
   )
   ```

4. **Implement Quota Management:**
   Use AWS Service Quotas to manage and request increases in vCPU limits if necessary. This can be done using Boto3.

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('service-quotas')

   response = client.request_service_quota_increase(
       ServiceCode='ec2',
       QuotaCode='L-1216C47A',
       DesiredValue=200
   )
   ```

By implementing these steps, you can effectively monitor, alert, and manage vCPU usage to prevent EC2 instances from reaching their vCPU limits.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "INSTANCES", click on "Instances".
3. Select the EC2 instance that you want to check.
4. In the bottom panel, click on the "Monitoring" tab.
5. Here, you can see the "CPU Utilization" metric. If the CPU Utilization is consistently high or at its maximum limit, it indicates that the EC2 instance is reaching its vCPU limit.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can install AWS CLI using pip (Python package manager) by running the command `pip install awscli`. After installation, you can configure it by running `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 instances: Use the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 describe-instances` to list all the EC2 instances in your account. This command will return a JSON output with details of all the instances.

3. Extract instance IDs and their vCPU count: From the output of the previous command, you can extract the instance IDs and their vCPU count using the command `aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId, CpuOptions.CoreCount]' --output text`. This command will return a list of instance IDs along with their vCPU count.

4. Check vCPU limit: Now, for each instance ID, you can check if it has reached its vCPU limit by comparing the vCPU count from the previous step with the vCPU limit of the instance type. You can get the vCPU limit of an instance type from the AWS documentation. If the vCPU count is equal to or greater than the vCPU limit, then the instance has reached its vCPU limit.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3):** First, you need to set up AWS SDK (Boto3) for Python. This allows Python to interact with AWS services. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:** Next, you need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a file at ~/.aws/credentials. At the command line, type the following:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   Then input your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

3. **Create a Python Script to Check vCPU Usage:** Now, you can create a Python script that uses Boto3 to check the vCPU usage of your EC2 instances. Here's a basic example:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a session using your AWS credentials
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )

   # Create an EC2 resource object using the session
   ec2_resource = session.resource('ec2')

   # Iterate over all your instances
   for instance in ec2_resource.instances.all():
       # Get the instance type
       instance_type = instance.instance_type

       # Get the vCPU info for the instance type
       ec2 = session.client('ec2')
       vcpu_info = ec2.describe_instance_types(InstanceTypes=[instance_type])

       # Get the current vCPU usage
       cloudwatch = session.client('cloudwatch')
       vcpu_usage = cloudwatch.get_metric_statistics(
           Namespace='AWS/EC2',
           MetricName='CPUUtilization',
           Dimensions=[
               {
                   'Name': 'InstanceId',
                   'Value': instance.id
               },
           ],
           StartTime=datetime.datetime.utcnow() - datetime.timedelta(seconds=600),
           EndTime=datetime.datetime.utcnow(),
           Period=60,
           Statistics=['Average']
       )

       # Check if the vCPU usage is at the limit
       if vcpu_usage['Datapoints']:
           average_vcpu_usage = vcpu_usage['Datapoints'][0]['Average']
           vcpu_limit = vcpu_info['InstanceTypes'][0]['VCpuInfo']['DefaultVCpus']
           if average_vcpu_usage >= vcpu_limit:
               print(f"Instance {instance.id} is at vCPU limit.")
   ```

4. **Run the Python Script:** Finally, you can run the Python script. It will print out the IDs of any instances that are at their vCPU limit. If no instances are at their limit, it won't print anything.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Instances Should Not Reach vCPU Limit" in AWS using the AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. Select the EC2 instance that is reaching the vCPU limit.
3. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Instance Settings" and then click on "Change Instance Type".
4. Select a larger instance type that provides more vCPUs than the current instance type.
5. Review the changes and click on "Apply".
6. Once the instance type is changed, the instance will have more vCPUs and the vCPU limit will no longer be reached.

Alternatively, you can also use AWS Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the instance type based on the resource utilization of the instance. This will ensure that the instance always has enough vCPUs and other resources to handle the workload.
