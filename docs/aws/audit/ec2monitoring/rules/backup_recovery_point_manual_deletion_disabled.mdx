### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose 'Snapshots' under 'Elastic Block Store'.

3. In the 'Snapshots' page, select the snapshot that you want to check.

4. In the 'Description' tab at the bottom of the page, check the 'Tags' section. If the 'Tags' section includes a tag with the key 'aws:backup:deletion-protected' and the value 'true', then manual deletion is disabled for the snapshot. If not, then manual deletion is not disabled.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each snapshot in your account.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the EC2 instances using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with the details of all the EC2 instances.

3. To check if manual deletion of backups is disabled, you need to check the 'DeletionPolicy' attribute of each instance. You can do this by using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --attribute disableApiTermination
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance you want to check. This command will return the 'DisableApiTermination' attribute of the instance, which indicates whether manual deletion is disabled or not.

4. Repeat step 3 for each instance. If the 'DisableApiTermination' attribute is 'false' for any instance, it means that manual deletion of backups is not disabled for that instance.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. You can configure it in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   Then input your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

3. Write the Python script: Now you can write a Python script that uses Boto3 to check if manual deletion of backups is disabled for all EC2 instances. Here's a simple script that does this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_backup_deletion_protection():
       ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
       instances = ec2.instances.all()

       for instance in instances:
           try:
               if instance.describe_attribute(Attribute='disableApiTermination')['DisableApiTermination']['Value']:
                   print(f"Instance {instance.id} has backup deletion protection enabled.")
               else:
                   print(f"Instance {instance.id} does not have backup deletion protection enabled.")
           except Exception as e:
               print(f"Error checking instance {instance.id}: {e}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_backup_deletion_protection()
   ```

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python check_backup_deletion_protection.py
   ```

   This will print out whether each EC2 instance has backup deletion protection enabled or not.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of manual deletion of backups in AWS EC2, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and log in with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to AWS Backup Service**: In the AWS Management Console, search for "Backup" in the services search bar and select the "Backup" service.

3. **Select Backup Vault**: In the AWS Backup console, select the backup vault where your EC2 backups are stored.

4. **Edit Backup Vault Settings**:
   - Click on the backup vault name to open the details.
   - Click on the "Settings" tab.

5. **Disable Manual Deletion**:
   - In the "Settings" tab, find the "Backup vault access policy" section.
   - Click on the "Edit" button next to the "Backup vault access policy" to modify the settings.
   - In the "Backup vault access policy" editor, ensure that the "Allow backup plan actions" option is selected.
   - Uncheck the option that allows manual deletion of backups.
   - Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

6. **Verify Changes**:
   - Once you have disabled manual deletion of backups, verify the changes by navigating back to the backup vault details and checking the settings to ensure that manual deletion is disabled.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the issue of manual deletion of backups in AWS EC2 using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of backup manual deletion being enabled for AWS EC2 instances using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to describe the current backup policy for the EC2 instance:

```
aws backup get-backup-plan --backup-plan-id "arn:aws:backup:us-west-2:123456789012:backup-plan:1"
```

Replace the `backup-plan-id` with the actual ARN of the backup plan associated with the EC2 instance.

2. Identify the `BackupPlanName` and `BackupPlanRule` associated with the EC2 instance.

3. Run the following command to update the backup plan and disable manual deletion:

```
aws backup update-backup-plan --backup-plan-id "arn:aws:backup:us-west-2:123456789012:backup-plan:1" --lifecycle DeleteAfterDays=30 MoveToColdStorageAfterDays=30 --backup-plan RuleName="BackupRule",TargetBackupVaultName="MyBackupVault",ScheduleExpression="cron(0 0 * * ? *)",StartWindowMinutes=60,CompletionWindowMinutes=60,RecoveryPointTags={"Key":"Environment","Value":"Production"}
```

Replace the `backup-plan-id`, `DeleteAfterDays`, `MoveToColdStorageAfterDays`, `RuleName`, `TargetBackupVaultName`, `ScheduleExpression`, `StartWindowMinutes`, `CompletionWindowMinutes`, and `RecoveryPointTags` with the appropriate values for your environment.

4. Verify the update by running the following command:

```
aws backup get-backup-plan --backup-plan-id "arn:aws:backup:us-west-2:123456789012:backup-plan:1"
```

Ensure that the manual deletion is disabled in the updated backup plan.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of backup manual deletion being enabled for AWS EC2 instances using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of Backup Manual Deletion being enabled for AWS EC2 instances using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Boto3 library:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

2. Use the following Python script to disable the manual deletion of backups for all EC2 instances in your AWS account:

```python
import boto3

def disable_backup_manual_deletion():
    # Create a Boto3 EC2 client
    ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

    # Describe all EC2 instances in the account
    response = ec2_client.describe_instances()

    for reservation in response['Reservations']:
        for instance in reservation['Instances']:
            instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
            
            # Disable the manual deletion of backups for the instance
            try:
                ec2_client.modify_instance_attribute(
                    InstanceId=instance_id,
                    DisableApiTermination={
                        'Value': True
                    }
                )
                print(f"Disabled manual deletion of backups for instance: {instance_id}")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error disabling manual deletion of backups for instance {instance_id}: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    disable_backup_manual_deletion()
```

3. Run the Python script to disable manual deletion of backups for all EC2 instances in your AWS account.

This script will iterate through all EC2 instances in your AWS account and disable the manual deletion of backups for each instance. This will help prevent accidental deletion of backups for your EC2 instances.
