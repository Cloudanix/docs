<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent EC2 Reserved Instances from having a payment pending status using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   - Ensure you have Boto3 installed and configured with the necessary AWS credentials.

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Check Reserved Instances Payment Status:**
   - Use Boto3 to describe your reserved instances and check their payment status.

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_reserved_instances_payment_status():
       ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
       response = ec2_client.describe_reserved_instances()
       for ri in response['ReservedInstances']:
           if ri['State'] == 'payment-pending':
               print(f"Reserved Instance {ri['ReservedInstancesId']} has payment pending.")
           else:
               print(f"Reserved Instance {ri['ReservedInstancesId']} is in state {ri['State']}.")

   check_reserved_instances_payment_status()
   ```

3. **Automate Payment Verification:**
   - Automate the verification of payment status by integrating with your billing system or AWS Cost Explorer to ensure payments are processed.

   ```python
   import boto3

   def verify_payment_status():
       ce_client = boto3.client('ce')
       response = ce_client.get_cost_and_usage(
           TimePeriod={
               'Start': '2023-01-01',
               'End': '2023-01-31'
           },
           Granularity='MONTHLY',
           Metrics=['UnblendedCost']
       )
       for result in response['ResultsByTime']:
           print(f"Cost for the period: {result['Total']['UnblendedCost']['Amount']} {result['Total']['UnblendedCost']['Unit']}")

   verify_payment_status()
   ```

4. **Notify and Alert:**
   - Set up notifications or alerts if any reserved instances are found with a payment pending status. This can be done using AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service).

   ```python
   import boto3

   def notify_pending_payments():
       sns_client = boto3.client('sns')
       ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
       response = ec2_client.describe_reserved_instances()
       for ri in response['ReservedInstances']:
           if ri['State'] == 'payment-pending':
               message = f"Reserved Instance {ri['ReservedInstancesId']} has payment pending."
               sns_client.publish(
                   TopicArn='arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:YourSNSTopic',
                   Message=message,
                   Subject='EC2 Reserved Instance Payment Pending Alert'
               )

   notify_pending_payments()
   ```

By following these steps, you can automate the process of checking and preventing EC2 Reserved Instances from having a payment pending status using Python scripts.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu, then selecting "EC2" under the "Compute" category.
3. In the EC2 dashboard, select "Reserved Instances" from the left-hand menu.
4. In the Reserved Instances page, check the "Status" column for each instance. If the status is "payment-pending", it indicates that the Reserved Instance has a pending payment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 Reserved Instances: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all your EC2 Reserved Instances:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --query 'ReservedInstances[*].[ReservedInstancesId,State]' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all your Reserved Instances along with their IDs and states.

3. Check for Payment Pending status: From the output of the previous command, check if any of the Reserved Instances have their state as 'payment-pending'. If any Reserved Instance is in 'payment-pending' state, it means that the payment for that Reserved Instance is not yet complete.

4. Automate the process with a Python script: You can automate the process of checking for 'payment-pending' Reserved Instances using a Python script. Use the boto3 library in Python to interact with AWS services. The script will use the `describe_reserved_instances` function to get a list of all Reserved Instances and then check their states for 'payment-pending'. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   response = ec2.describe_reserved_instances()

   for instance in response['ReservedInstances']:
       if instance['State'] == 'payment-pending':
           print(f"Reserved Instance with ID {instance['ReservedInstancesId']} has payment pending.")
   ```
   Run this script regularly to keep track of any Reserved Instances with pending payments.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): To interact with AWS services, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```
After installing boto3, you need to configure it. You can do this by creating a new session:

```python
import boto3
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    aws_session_token='SESSION_TOKEN',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

2. Connect to the EC2 service: After configuring boto3, you can connect to the EC2 service. You can do this by creating an EC2 resource object:

```python
ec2 = session.resource('ec2')
```

3. Retrieve all reserved instances: You can retrieve all reserved instances by calling the `describe_reserved_instances` method on the EC2 client:

```python
reserved_instances = ec2.describe_reserved_instances()
```

4. Check if any reserved instances have payment pending: You can check if any reserved instances have payment pending by iterating over the reserved instances and checking the `State` attribute:

```python
for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedInstances']:
    if reserved_instance['State'] == 'payment-pending':
        print(f"Reserved instance {reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']} has payment pending.")
```

This script will print the IDs of all reserved instances that have payment pending.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of EC2 Reserved Instances having payment pending in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Identify the EC2 Reserved Instances that have payment pending by running the following command in AWS CLI:

```
aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --filters Name=state,Values=payment-pending
```

2. Note down the Reserved Instance ID of the EC2 Reserved Instance that has payment pending.

3. Cancel the payment pending of the EC2 Reserved Instance by running the following command in AWS CLI:

```
aws ec2 cancel-reserved-instances-listings --reserved-instances-id <ReservedInstanceID>
```

Replace `<ReservedInstanceID>` with the Reserved Instance ID noted in Step 2.

4. Verify that the payment pending of the EC2 Reserved Instance has been cancelled by running the following command in AWS CLI:

```
aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --filters Name=state,Values=payment-pending
```

This should return an empty response indicating that there are no EC2 Reserved Instances with payment pending.

5. Finally, to avoid such misconfigurations in the future, set up billing alerts in AWS to get notified when there are any payment issues with your Reserved Instances.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Reserved Instances Should Not Have Payment Pending" in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK modules in Python. For example, you can use the `boto3` module to interact with AWS services.

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create an EC2 client object using the `boto3.client()` method.

```python
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Use the `describe_reserved_instances()` method to get a list of all the reserved instances in your account.

```python
reserved_instances = ec2.describe_reserved_instances()
```

4. Iterate through the list of reserved instances and check if any of them have a payment pending status.

```python
for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedInstances']:
    if reserved_instance['State'] == 'payment-pending':
        # Remediation code goes here
```

5. If you find any reserved instances with a payment pending status, you can use the `modify_reserved_instances()` method to modify the payment option and complete the payment.

```python
ec2.modify_reserved_instances(
    ReservedInstancesIds=[reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']],
    ReservedInstancesModification={
        'ModificationType': 'purchase',
        'TargetConfigurations': [
            {
                'InstanceCount': reserved_instance['InstanceCount'],
                'OfferingId': reserved_instance['OfferingId']
            }
        ]
    }
)
```

6. Once the payment is completed, you can verify that the status of the reserved instance has changed to active using the `describe_reserved_instances()` method.

```python
reserved_instances = ec2.describe_reserved_instances(
    ReservedInstancesIds=[reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']]
)
if reserved_instances['ReservedInstances'][0]['State'] == 'active':
    print('Reserved instance payment completed successfully.')
else:
    print('Error: Reserved instance payment not completed.')
```

7. Finally, you can wrap the above code in a function and call it periodically to ensure that all reserved instances in your account have a valid payment status.

```python
import boto3

def remediate_reserved_instance_payment_pending():
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    reserved_instances = ec2.describe_reserved_instances()
    for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedInstances']:
        if reserved_instance['State'] == 'payment-pending':
            ec2.modify_reserved_instances(
                ReservedInstancesIds=[reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']],
                ReservedInstancesModification={
                    'ModificationType': 'purchase',
                    'TargetConfigurations': [
                        {
                            'InstanceCount': reserved_instance['InstanceCount'],
                            'OfferingId': reserved_instance['OfferingId']
                        }
                    ]
                }
            )
            reserved_instances = ec2.describe_reserved_instances(
                ReservedInstancesIds=[reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']]
            )
            if reserved_instances['ReservedInstances'][0]['State'] == 'active':
                print('Reserved instance payment completed successfully.')
            else:
                print('Error: Reserved instance payment not completed.')
```

Note: The above code is just an example to remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Reserved Instances Should Not Have Payment Pending" in AWS using Python. You may need to modify it based on your specific requirements and use case. Also, make sure to test the code in a non-production environment before running it in production.
