How to update security group inbound configuration to restrict Common Internet File System (CIFS) access to specific entities?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Login to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
2. Select the EC2 instance(s) that you want to restrict CIFS access to.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Unrestricted CIFS Access Should Not Be Allowed" Policy.)
3. Click on the "Security Groups" tab and select the security group that is associated with the instance(s).
4. Click on the "Inbound Rules" tab and locate the CIFS rule. It should be using TCP port 445.
5. Click on the "Edit" button next to the CIFS rule.
6. In the "Source" field, enter the specific entities that you want to allow CIFS access to. This can be an IP address range, a specific IP address, or a security group ID.
7. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.
