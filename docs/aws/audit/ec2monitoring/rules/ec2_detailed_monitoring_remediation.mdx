1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose 'Instances'.

3. Select the instance that you want to check for detailed monitoring.

4. In the bottom pane, choose the 'Monitoring' tab.

5. In the 'CloudWatch Monitoring' section, check the 'Detailed Monitoring' status. If it is disabled, then Detailed Monitoring for that EC2 instance is not enabled.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account details. You can download AWS CLI from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command.

2. List all EC2 instances: Use the following command to list all the EC2 instances in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId]' --output text
   ```

3. Check detailed monitoring status: For each instance ID retrieved from the previous step, use the following command to check the detailed monitoring status.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id> --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[Monitoring]'
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the EC2 instance you want to check. The command will return the monitoring status for the specified EC2 instance.

4. Analyze the output: If the State value in the output is "disabled", then detailed monitoring is not enabled for the EC2 instance. If the State value is "enabled", then detailed monitoring is enabled. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each EC2 instance in your AWS account.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3, AWS EC2, and more. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```
After installation, you need to configure it. You can do this in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```
This will prompt you for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, AWS Region. These are used to make programmatic calls to AWS from your machine.

2. Use Boto3 to interact with AWS EC2: Once Boto3 is installed and configured, you can start using it to check if Detailed Monitoring is enabled for your EC2 instances. Here is a simple script that lists all EC2 instances and their monitoring status:

```python
import boto3

def check_detailed_monitoring():
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
    for instance in ec2.instances.all():
        print('ID: {}, State: {}, Monitoring: {}'.format(instance.id, instance.state, instance.monitoring))

check_detailed_monitoring()
```
This script will print the ID, state, and monitoring status of all EC2 instances. If the monitoring status is 'enabled', then Detailed Monitoring is enabled.

3. Analyze the output: The output of the script will give you the monitoring status of each EC2 instance. If the monitoring status is 'disabled', then Detailed Monitoring is not enabled for that instance.

4. Automate the process: You can automate this process by running this script at regular intervals, or by triggering it based on certain events. This way, you can continuously monitor the status of Detailed Monitoring for your EC2 instances and take action if it is not enabled.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Detailed Monitoring for EC2 Instances Should Be Enabled" for AWS using AWS console, please follow the below steps:

Step 1: Login to AWS console using your credentials.

Step 2: Go to the EC2 dashboard by clicking on the EC2 service from the AWS console home page.

Step 3: From the left-hand side panel, select "Instances" to view all the instances in the region.

Step 4: Select the instance for which you want to enable detailed monitoring.

Step 5: Right-click on the instance and select "Monitor and troubleshoot" from the drop-down list.

Step 6: Click on "Enable detailed monitoring" from the list.

Step 7: A pop-up will appear asking you to confirm the action, click on "Enable" to enable detailed monitoring.

Step 8: Once the detailed monitoring is enabled, you can view the metrics by selecting the instance and clicking on the "Monitoring" tab from the bottom panel.

Step 9: You can also enable detailed monitoring for multiple instances at once by selecting them and clicking on the "Actions" button from the top panel and selecting "Monitor with CloudWatch" from the drop-down list.

Step 10: Click on "Enable detailed monitoring" and confirm the action.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Detailed Monitoring for EC2 Instances Should Be Enabled" for AWS using AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Detailed Monitoring for EC2 Instances Should Be Enabled" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow the steps below:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to enable detailed monitoring for all EC2 instances in the default region:

```
aws ec2 monitor-instances --instance-ids $(aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId' --output text)
```

This command uses the `aws ec2 describe-instances` command to list all EC2 instances in the default region, and the `aws ec2 monitor-instances` command to enable detailed monitoring for each instance.

3. If you want to enable detailed monitoring for specific instances, you can replace `$(aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId' --output text)` with a comma-separated list of instance IDs.

```
aws ec2 monitor-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0,i-0987654321fedcba0
```

4. Verify that detailed monitoring is enabled for the instances by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids $(aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId' --output text) --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].Monitoring.State'
```

This command uses the `aws ec2 describe-instances` command to list the monitoring state for each instance.

If the monitoring state is `disabled`, wait a few minutes and run the command again to verify that it has been enabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Detailed Monitoring for EC2 Instances Should Be Enabled" misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of detailed monitoring for EC2 instances not being enabled in AWS using python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```
import boto3
```

2. Create a boto3 client for EC2:
```
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Get a list of all EC2 instances:
```
instances = ec2.describe_instances()
```

4. Loop through each instance and check if detailed monitoring is enabled or not:
```
for reservation in instances['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
        monitoring = instance['Monitoring']['State']
        if monitoring == 'disabled':
            # Enable detailed monitoring for the instance
            ec2.monitor_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
```

5. If detailed monitoring is disabled for an instance, enable it using the `monitor_instances` method of the EC2 client.

6. Once detailed monitoring is enabled, you can verify it by checking the monitoring state of the instance using the `describe_instances` method.

7. You can also create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the status of detailed monitoring for all EC2 instances and get notified if it is disabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of detailed monitoring for EC2 instances not being enabled in AWS using python.
