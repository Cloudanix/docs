1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the left navigation pane, under the "Network & Security" section, click on "Security Groups".
3. In the Security Groups page, you will see a list of all the security groups associated with your EC2 instances. Click on the security group that you want to check.
4. In the details pane at the bottom, click on the "Inbound" tab. Here, you can see all the inbound rules for the selected security group. Check if there is any rule that allows unrestricted RDP access (i.e., the rule has "RDP" or "3389" in the port range and "0.0.0.0/0" or "::/0" in the source). If such a rule exists, then unrestricted RDP access is allowed.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```

   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all security groups: The next step is to list all the security groups in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query "SecurityGroups[*].{Name:GroupName,ID:GroupId}"
   ```

   This command will return a list of all security groups along with their names and IDs.

3. Check for unrestricted RDP access: Now, for each security group, you need to check if it allows unrestricted RDP access. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query "SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions[*].{FromPort:FromPort,ToPort:ToPort,IpRanges:IpRanges[*].CidrIp}"
   ```

   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group you want to check. This command will return a list of all IP permissions for the specified security group.

4. Analyze the output: If the output of the previous command includes an IP range of `0.0.0.0/0` for the port `3389` (the default port for RDP), it means that the security group allows unrestricted RDP access.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   First, you need to install Boto3. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3`. After installing Boto3, you need to configure it. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. Import necessary libraries and establish a session:
   In your Python script, you need to import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS. Here is an example:

   ```python
   import boto3
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ec2 = session.resource('ec2')
   ```

3. Retrieve and inspect security groups:
   Next, you need to retrieve all security groups and inspect their ingress rules. If a security group has an ingress rule that allows unrestricted RDP access (port 3389 open to 0.0.0.0/0), then it is misconfigured. Here is an example:

   ```python
   for security_group in ec2.security_groups.all():
       for permission in security_group.ip_permissions:
           for ip_range in permission['IpRanges']:
               if '3389' in permission['FromPort'] and '3389' in permission['ToPort'] and ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                   print(f"Security Group {security_group.id} allows unrestricted RDP access.")
   ```

4. Run the script:
   Finally, you can run the script by executing the command `python script_name.py` in your terminal. If there are any security groups that allow unrestricted RDP access, their IDs will be printed to the console.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the unrestricted RDP access issue in AWS, you can follow these steps:

1. Login to the AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the EC2 service.

3. Select the EC2 instance(s) for which you want to restrict RDP access.

4. Click on the "Security Groups" tab in the bottom pane.

5. Select the security group(s) associated with the instance(s).

6. Click on the "Inbound Rules" tab.

7. Locate the rule that allows RDP access from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0).

8. Click on the "Edit" button next to the rule.

9. Change the source IP address to a specific IP address or range of IP addresses that are allowed to access RDP.

10. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

11. Repeat these steps for all instances that have unrestricted RDP access.

By following these steps, you can remediate the unrestricted RDP access issue in AWS and restrict RDP access to specific IP addresses only.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the unrestricted RDP access in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the below command to list all the security groups in your AWS account.

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups
```

3. Identify the security group that allows unrestricted RDP access.

4. Run the below command to revoke the inbound rule that allows unrestricted RDP access.

```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 3389 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

Note: Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group identified in step 3.

5. Verify that the inbound rule has been revoked by running the below command.

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>
```

Note: Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group identified in step 3.

6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all the security groups that allow unrestricted RDP access.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the unrestricted RDP access in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate unrestricted RDP access in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK libraries in your Python script. You can use the Boto3 library to interact with AWS services.

```python
import boto3
```

2. Initialize the EC2 client using the Boto3 library.

```python
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Use the `describe_security_groups` method to get a list of all security groups in your AWS account.

```python
response = ec2.describe_security_groups()
security_groups = response['SecurityGroups']
```

4. Loop through the security groups and check if any of them have an inbound rule allowing unrestricted RDP access (port 3389).

```python
for sg in security_groups:
    for rule in sg['IpPermissions']:
        if rule['IpProtocol'] == 'tcp' and rule['FromPort'] == 3389 and rule['ToPort'] == 3389 and rule['IpRanges'] == [{'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'}]:
            # Remove the rule that allows unrestricted RDP access
            ec2.revoke_security_group_ingress(
                GroupId=sg['GroupId'],
                IpPermissions=[rule]
            )
```

5. Save the Python script and run it to remove the rule that allows unrestricted RDP access in all security groups in your AWS account.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to modify security groups in your AWS account before running the script.
