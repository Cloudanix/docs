### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard. 

2. In the navigation pane, select "Systems Manager Shared Resources" and then "Managed Instances". This will display a list of all your instances that are managed by Systems Manager.

3. For each instance, check the "Last Ping Time" column. This column shows the last time the instance communicated with Systems Manager. If the last ping time is recent, it means that the Systems Manager agent is running on the instance and can receive commands.

4. Check the "Patch Group" column. If the instance is part of a patch group, it means that it is configured to receive patches from Systems Manager. If the column is empty or the patch group is not what you expect, it could indicate a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local system. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "describe-instance-information" command to list all your EC2 instances managed by Systems Manager. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws ssm describe-instance-information
   ```

3. To check if a specific patch has been installed on an instance, you can use the "describe-patch-state" command. Replace "{instance-id}" with the ID of your instance and "{patch-id}" with the ID of the patch you want to check. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws ssm describe-patch-state --instance-ids "{instance-id}" --patch-group "{patch-id}"
   ```

4. The output will show the patch state for the specified instance. If the patch is installed, the "InstalledCount" field will be greater than 0. If the patch is not installed, the "MissingCount" field will be greater than 0.

#### Using Python

1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3):**
   First, you need to set up AWS SDK (Boto3) for Python. This allows your Python application, script, or lambda function to make requests to AWS services such as AWS Systems Manager. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:**
   You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can configure your credentials via the AWS CLI, or by manually creating the files yourself. On your local machine, the credentials file is located at `~/.aws/credentials`. At a minimum, the credentials file should specify the access key and secret access key. To specify these for the `default` profile, you can use the following format:

   ```python
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. **Create a Python Script to Check Patch Installation:**
   You can use the `describe_instance_information` method from the AWS Systems Manager client to get information about the patch state of your EC2 instances. Here is a simple script that prints the patch state of each instance:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a session using your AWS credentials
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
   )

   # Create a Systems Manager client
   ssm = session.client('ssm')

   # Get information about your instances
   response = ssm.describe_instance_information()

   # Print the patch state of each instance
   for instance in response['InstanceInformationList']:
       print(f"Instance ID: {instance['InstanceId']}")
       print(f"Patch State: {instance['IsLatestVersion']}")
   ```

4. **Interpret the Results:**
   The script will print the patch state of each instance. If `IsLatestVersion` is `False`, it means that the instance is not running the latest version of Systems Manager, and therefore a patch installation should be done. If it's `True`, it means that the instance is running the latest version of Systems Manager, and no patch installation is necessary.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of patch installation not being done on Systems Manager for AWS EC2 instances and ensure that your instances are up to date with the latest patches and security updates.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of patch installation not being done on Systems Manager for AWS EC2 instances using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Install and configure AWS CLI:
   - If you haven't already installed the AWS CLI, you can follow the instructions here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html

2. Identify the EC2 instances that need patching:
   - You can list all EC2 instances in your AWS account using the following AWS CLI command:
     ```
     aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId, State.Name]' --output table
     ```

3. Attach an IAM role with the necessary permissions to the EC2 instances:
   - Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions for Systems Manager. You can create a role with the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` managed policy attached.
   - Attach this IAM role to the EC2 instances that need patching. You can do this by modifying the instance attributes using the AWS CLI:
     ```
     aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --iam-instance-profile Name=<role-name>
     ```

4. Install the SSM Agent on the EC2 instances:
   - The Systems Manager requires the SSM Agent to be installed on the EC2 instances. You can automate the installation process using AWS Systems Manager Run Command or manually install the agent on each instance. Here is an example of how to install the agent using AWS Systems Manager Run Command:
     ```
     aws ssm send-command --document-name "AWS-InstallAWSPatchInstallUnifiedAgent" --targets "Key=InstanceIds,Values=<instance-id>" --parameters '{"sourceType":["github"],"sourceInfo":["aws-quickstart/quickstart-awspatchbaseline"],"packageName":["awspatchbaseline"],"version":["latest"]}' --timeout-seconds 600 --max-concurrency "50" --max-errors "0" --output-s3-bucket-name "<bucket-name>" --output-s3-key-prefix "<prefix>"
     ```

5. Configure Patch Baseline in Systems Manager:
   - Create a patch baseline in AWS Systems Manager to define the patching schedule and rules for your EC2 instances. You can do this using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
   - Here is an example of how to create a patch baseline using AWS CLI:
     ```
     aws ssm create-patch-baseline --name "MyPatchBaseline" --approval-rules "PatchRules=[{PatchFilterGroup:{PatchFilters=[{Key=PRODUCT,Values=[WindowsServer2019]},{Key=CLASSIFICATION,Values=[Critical,SecurityUpdates]}],PatchFilterGroupType=and}],ApproveAfterDays=7,ComplianceLevel=CRITICAL}"
     ```

6. Schedule patching for EC2 instances:
   - You can schedule patching for your EC2 instances by creating a maintenance window in AWS Systems Manager and associating it with the patch baseline you created. You can do this using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
   - Here is an example of how to create a maintenance window using AWS CLI:
     ```
     aws ssm create-maintenance-window --name "MyMaintenanceWindow" --schedule "CronExpression=<cron-expression>" --duration 3 --cutoff 1 --allow-unassociated-targets
     ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of patch installation not being done on Systems Manager for AWS EC2 instances using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of not having patch installations done on AWS EC2 instances using Systems Manager, you can use the following Python script to automate the process:

1. Install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

2. Use the following Python script to create a patch baseline and schedule patch installations for your EC2 instances:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the boto3 client
ssm = boto3.client('ssm')

# Define the EC2 instance IDs for which you want to schedule patch installations
instance_ids = ['INSTANCE_ID_1', 'INSTANCE_ID_2']

# Create a patch baseline
response = ssm.create_patch_baseline(
    Name='MyPatchBaseline',
    OperatingSystem='WINDOWS',  # Change this to 'AMAZON_LINUX' if using Amazon Linux
    ApprovalRules={
        'PatchRules': [
            {
                'PatchFilterGroup': {
                    'PatchFilters': [
                        {
                            'Key': 'CLASSIFICATION',
                            'Values': ['Security']
                        }
                    ]
                },
                'ApproveAfterDays': 0
            }
        ]
    }
)

# Get the patch baseline ID
baseline_id = response['BaselineId']

# Create a patch group for the EC2 instances
response = ssm.register_target_with_maintenance_window(
    WindowId='MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_ID',
    ResourceType='INSTANCE',
    Targets=[
        {
            'Key': 'InstanceIds',
            'Values': instance_ids
        }
    ],
    OwnerInformation='Patch Group'
)

# Get the patch group ID
patch_group_id = response['WindowTargetId']

# Create a maintenance window task to install patches
response = ssm.register_task_with_maintenance_window(
    WindowId='MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_ID',
    Targets=[
        {
            'Key': 'WindowTargetIds',
            'Values': [patch_group_id]
        }
    ],
    TaskArn='AWS-RunPatchBaseline',
    TaskType='RUN_COMMAND',
    Priority=1,
    ServiceRoleArn='MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_ROLE_ARN',
    TaskInvocationParameters={
        'MaintenanceWindowRunCommandParameters': {
            'DocumentHash': 'DOCUMENT_HASH',
            'DocumentHashType': 'Sha256',
            'Parameters': {
                'Operation': ['Install'],
                'BaselineOverride': [baseline_id]
            }
        }
    }
)

# Get the maintenance window task ID
task_id = response['WindowTaskId']

print(f'Patch installations scheduled for EC2 instances {instance_ids} using Systems Manager with maintenance window task ID {task_id}')
```

3. Replace the following placeholders in the script:
   - `INSTANCE_ID_1`, `INSTANCE_ID_2`: Replace these with the actual EC2 instance IDs for which you want to schedule patch installations.
   - `MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_ID`: Replace this with the ID of the maintenance window in which you want to schedule the patch installations.
   - `MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_ROLE_ARN`: Replace this with the ARN of the IAM role that has permissions to run Systems Manager tasks in the maintenance window.
   - `DOCUMENT_HASH`: Replace this with the hash of the AWS-RunPatchBaseline document. You can get this from the Systems Manager Documents page in the AWS Management Console.

4. Run the Python script to create a patch baseline, register the EC2 instances in a patch group, and schedule patch installations using Systems Manager.

This script will help you automate the process of scheduling patch installations for your EC2 instances in AWS using Systems Manager.
