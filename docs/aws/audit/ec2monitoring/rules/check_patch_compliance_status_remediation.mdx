1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard. 

2. In the navigation pane, under "Systems Manager Services", click on "Managed Instances". This will display a list of all your instances that are being managed by Systems Manager.

3. For each instance, check the "Last Ping Time" column. This column shows the last time the instance communicated with Systems Manager. If the time is recent, it means that the instance is actively being managed and should have the latest patches installed.

4. To confirm if the patches are installed, click on the instance ID to open its details page. Under the "Inventory" tab, you can see a list of all the software installed on the instance, including patches. Check if the required patches are listed there.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure the AWS CLI on your local system. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will need to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "describe-instance-information" command to list all your EC2 instances managed by Systems Manager. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws ssm describe-instance-information
   ```

3. To check if a specific patch has been installed on an instance, you can use the "describe-patch-state" command. You will need to provide the instance ID and the patch ID. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws ssm describe-patch-state --instance-id <instance-id> --patch-group <patch-id>
   ```

4. If the patch is not installed, the command will return an empty result. If the patch is installed, the command will return information about the patch, including its installation date and status.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3):** First, you need to set up AWS SDK (Boto3) for Python. This allows Python to interact with AWS services. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:** Next, you need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating the credentials file yourself:

   ```python
   aws configure
   ```

   Then input your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

3. **Create a Python Script to Check Patch Installation:** Now, you can create a Python script that uses Boto3 to interact with the AWS Systems Manager. This script will list all instances and check if the latest patches have been installed.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a session using your AWS credentials
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )

   # Create an SSM client
   ssm = session.client('ssm')

   # List all instances
   instances = ssm.describe_instance_information()

   # Check each instance for patch compliance
   for instance in instances['InstanceInformationList']:
       instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
       response = ssm.describe_instance_patch_states(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
       for patch_state in response['InstancePatchStates']:
           if patch_state['PatchGroup'] != 'Installed':
               print(f"Instance {instance_id} is not up to date.")
   ```

4. **Run the Python Script:** Finally, you can run the Python script. If there are any instances that are not up to date, the script will print out their instance IDs. This allows you to easily identify which instances need to be patched.

   ```python
   python check_patch.py
   ```

Please replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your actual AWS access key and secret key.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of patch installation not being done on Systems Manager for AWS EC2 instances using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Install and configure AWS CLI:
   - If you haven't already installed the AWS CLI, you can follow the instructions here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html

2. Identify the EC2 instances that need patching:
   - You can list all EC2 instances in your AWS account using the following AWS CLI command:
     ```
     aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId, State.Name]' --output table
     ```

3. Attach an IAM role with the necessary permissions to the EC2 instances:
   - Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions for Systems Manager. You can create a role with the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` managed policy attached.
   - Attach this IAM role to the EC2 instances that need patching. You can do this by modifying the instance attributes using the AWS CLI:
     ```
     aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --iam-instance-profile Name=<role-name>
     ```

4. Install the SSM Agent on the EC2 instances:
   - The Systems Manager requires the SSM Agent to be installed on the EC2 instances. You can automate the installation process using AWS Systems Manager Run Command or manually install the agent on each instance. Here is an example of how to install the agent using AWS Systems Manager Run Command:
     ```
     aws ssm send-command --document-name "AWS-InstallAWSPatchInstallUnifiedAgent" --targets "Key=InstanceIds,Values=<instance-id>" --parameters '{"sourceType":["github"],"sourceInfo":["aws-quickstart/quickstart-awspatchbaseline"],"packageName":["awspatchbaseline"],"version":["latest"]}' --timeout-seconds 600 --max-concurrency "50" --max-errors "0" --output-s3-bucket-name "<bucket-name>" --output-s3-key-prefix "<prefix>"
     ```

5. Configure Patch Baseline in Systems Manager:
   - Create a patch baseline in AWS Systems Manager to define the patching schedule and rules for your EC2 instances. You can do this using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
   - Here is an example of how to create a patch baseline using AWS CLI:
     ```
     aws ssm create-patch-baseline --name "MyPatchBaseline" --approval-rules "PatchRules=[{PatchFilterGroup:{PatchFilters=[{Key=PRODUCT,Values=[WindowsServer2019]},{Key=CLASSIFICATION,Values=[Critical,SecurityUpdates]}],PatchFilterGroupType=and}],ApproveAfterDays=7,ComplianceLevel=CRITICAL}"
     ```

6. Schedule patching for EC2 instances:
   - You can schedule patching for your EC2 instances by creating a maintenance window in AWS Systems Manager and associating it with the patch baseline you created. You can do this using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
   - Here is an example of how to create a maintenance window using AWS CLI:
     ```
     aws ssm create-maintenance-window --name "MyMaintenanceWindow" --schedule "CronExpression=<cron-expression>" --duration 3 --cutoff 1 --allow-unassociated-targets
     ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of patch installation not being done on Systems Manager for AWS EC2 instances using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of not having patch installations done on AWS EC2 instances using Systems Manager, you can use the following Python script to automate the process:

1. Install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

2. Use the following Python script to create a patch baseline and schedule patch installations for your EC2 instances:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the boto3 client
ssm = boto3.client('ssm')

# Define the EC2 instance IDs for which you want to schedule patch installations
instance_ids = ['INSTANCE_ID_1', 'INSTANCE_ID_2']

# Create a patch baseline
response = ssm.create_patch_baseline(
    Name='MyPatchBaseline',
    OperatingSystem='WINDOWS',  # Change this to 'AMAZON_LINUX' if using Amazon Linux
    ApprovalRules={
        'PatchRules': [
            {
                'PatchFilterGroup': {
                    'PatchFilters': [
                        {
                            'Key': 'CLASSIFICATION',
                            'Values': ['Security']
                        }
                    ]
                },
                'ApproveAfterDays': 0
            }
        ]
    }
)

# Get the patch baseline ID
baseline_id = response['BaselineId']

# Create a patch group for the EC2 instances
response = ssm.register_target_with_maintenance_window(
    WindowId='MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_ID',
    ResourceType='INSTANCE',
    Targets=[
        {
            'Key': 'InstanceIds',
            'Values': instance_ids
        }
    ],
    OwnerInformation='Patch Group'
)

# Get the patch group ID
patch_group_id = response['WindowTargetId']

# Create a maintenance window task to install patches
response = ssm.register_task_with_maintenance_window(
    WindowId='MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_ID',
    Targets=[
        {
            'Key': 'WindowTargetIds',
            'Values': [patch_group_id]
        }
    ],
    TaskArn='AWS-RunPatchBaseline',
    TaskType='RUN_COMMAND',
    Priority=1,
    ServiceRoleArn='MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_ROLE_ARN',
    TaskInvocationParameters={
        'MaintenanceWindowRunCommandParameters': {
            'DocumentHash': 'DOCUMENT_HASH',
            'DocumentHashType': 'Sha256',
            'Parameters': {
                'Operation': ['Install'],
                'BaselineOverride': [baseline_id]
            }
        }
    }
)

# Get the maintenance window task ID
task_id = response['WindowTaskId']

print(f'Patch installations scheduled for EC2 instances {instance_ids} using Systems Manager with maintenance window task ID {task_id}')
```

3. Replace the following placeholders in the script:
   - `INSTANCE_ID_1`, `INSTANCE_ID_2`: Replace these with the actual EC2 instance IDs for which you want to schedule patch installations.
   - `MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_ID`: Replace this with the ID of the maintenance window in which you want to schedule the patch installations.
   - `MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_ROLE_ARN`: Replace this with the ARN of the IAM role that has permissions to run Systems Manager tasks in the maintenance window.
   - `DOCUMENT_HASH`: Replace this with the hash of the AWS-RunPatchBaseline document. You can get this from the Systems Manager Documents page in the AWS Management Console.

4. Run the Python script to create a patch baseline, register the EC2 instances in a patch group, and schedule patch installations using Systems Manager.

This script will help you automate the process of scheduling patch installations for your EC2 instances in AWS using Systems Manager.
