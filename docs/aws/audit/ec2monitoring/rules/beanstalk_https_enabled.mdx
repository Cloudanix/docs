### More Info:

Ensure that HTTPS is enabled for the load balancer associated with your Amazon Elastic Beanstalk application environment in order to handle encrypted web traffic. By default, the load balancer handles unencrypted traffic requests (HTTP) through port 80. To enable HTTPS traffic over port 443, you must create and configure an HTTPS listener for the associated load balancer.
