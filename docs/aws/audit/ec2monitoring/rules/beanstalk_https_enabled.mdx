### More Info:

Ensure that HTTPS is enabled for the load balancer associated with your Amazon Elastic Beanstalk application environment in order to handle encrypted web traffic. By default, the load balancer handles unencrypted traffic requests (HTTP) through port 80. To enable HTTPS traffic over port 443, you must create and configure an HTTPS listener for the associated load balancer.

### Remediation

How to ensure HTTPS is enabled for Beanstalk environments.

#### Using AWS Console

To ensure HTTPS is enabled for AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments, you can follow these steps:

1. Configure a Load Balancer: If your Elastic Beanstalk environment is using a load balancer, you need to configure HTTPS at the load balancer level. You can either use the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to provision an SSL/TLS certificate or import your own certificate into ACM or IAM. Then, associate the certificate with the load balancer listener.

2. Enable HTTPS for the Environment URL: In the Elastic Beanstalk console, navigate to your environment, and go to the "Configuration" tab. Under "Network Tier", click on the "Modify" button. In the "Secure listener port" section, select "443" as the secure port. If you have an ACM certificate associated with the load balancer, select it from the drop-down menu. Click on "Apply" to save the changes.

3. Update Security Group Rules: Ensure that the security group associated with your Elastic Beanstalk environment allows inbound traffic on port 443 (HTTPS). By default, AWS Elastic Beanstalk creates security group rules for HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443), but you should verify that the rules are correctly configured.

4. Validate HTTPS Connectivity: After making the necessary changes, test the HTTPS connectivity to your Elastic Beanstalk environment. You can access your application using the HTTPS URL associated with your environment and verify that the connection is secure.

By following these steps, you can ensure that HTTPS is enabled for your AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments, providing secure communication between clients and your application.
