### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent unrestricted MongoDB access in EC2 using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Modify Security Groups:**
   - Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
   - Select **Security Groups** from the left-hand menu.
   - Identify the security group associated with your MongoDB instance.
   - Edit the **Inbound Rules** to restrict access. Remove any rules that allow unrestricted access (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0) on the MongoDB port (default is 27017).
   - Add specific IP addresses or CIDR blocks that are allowed to access the MongoDB instance.

2. **Use Network Access Control Lists (NACLs):**
   - Go to the **VPC Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
   - Select **Network ACLs** from the left-hand menu.
   - Identify the NACL associated with the subnet where your MongoDB instance resides.
   - Edit the **Inbound Rules** to restrict access to the MongoDB port (27017). Ensure that only trusted IP addresses or CIDR blocks are allowed.

3. **Enable VPC Flow Logs:**
   - In the **VPC Dashboard**, select **Your VPCs**.
   - Choose the VPC where your MongoDB instance is located.
   - Select **Actions** and then **Create Flow Log**.
   - Configure the flow log to capture traffic and send it to an S3 bucket or CloudWatch Logs for monitoring. This helps in auditing and identifying any unauthorized access attempts.

4. **Implement IAM Policies:**
   - Navigate to the **IAM Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
   - Create or modify IAM policies to ensure that only authorized users and roles have permissions to modify security groups and NACLs.
   - Attach these policies to the appropriate IAM users, groups, or roles to enforce least privilege access.

By following these steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of unrestricted access to your MongoDB instance on EC2.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent unrestricted MongoDB access in EC2 using AWS CLI, you need to ensure that the security group associated with your EC2 instance does not allow unrestricted access to MongoDB's default port (27017). Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Security Group:**
   First, identify the security group associated with your EC2 instance.

   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <your-instance-id> --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].SecurityGroups[*].GroupId" --output text
   ```

2. **Revoke Unrestricted Inbound Rule:**
   Revoke any existing inbound rule that allows unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) to port 27017.

   ```sh
   aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <your-security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 27017 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
   ```

3. **Add Restricted Inbound Rule:**
   Add a more restrictive inbound rule to allow access only from specific IP addresses or CIDR blocks.

   ```sh
   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <your-security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 27017 --cidr <your-allowed-cidr>
   ```

4. **Verify Security Group Rules:**
   Verify that the security group rules have been updated correctly.

   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <your-security-group-id> --query "SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions"
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your MongoDB instance running on EC2 is not exposed to unrestricted access, thereby enhancing its security.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent unrestricted MongoDB access in EC2 using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Install Required Libraries**
First, ensure you have the `boto3` library installed, which is the AWS SDK for Python.

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### 2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**
Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can do this by setting up the `~/.aws/credentials` file or by using environment variables.

### 3. **Create a Python Script to Modify Security Groups**
The following Python script will help you identify and modify security groups to restrict MongoDB access (default port 27017) to specific IP addresses or ranges.

```python
import boto3

# Initialize a session using Amazon EC2
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Define the port for MongoDB
MONGODB_PORT = 27017

# Define the IP range you want to allow (e.g., your internal network)
ALLOWED_IP_RANGE = '192.168.1.0/24'

# Get all security groups
response = ec2.describe_security_groups()

for sg in response['SecurityGroups']:
    for permission in sg['IpPermissions']:
        for ip_range in permission.get('IpRanges', []):
            if permission['FromPort'] == MONGODB_PORT and permission['ToPort'] == MONGODB_PORT:
                if ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                    print(f"Security Group {sg['GroupId']} has unrestricted MongoDB access. Revoking...")
                    # Revoke the unrestricted rule
                    ec2.revoke_security_group_ingress(
                        GroupId=sg['GroupId'],
                        IpProtocol=permission['IpProtocol'],
                        FromPort=permission['FromPort'],
                        ToPort=permission['ToPort'],
                        CidrIp=ip_range['CidrIp']
                    )
                    # Add a restricted rule
                    print(f"Adding restricted access to {ALLOWED_IP_RANGE} for MongoDB port {MONGODB_PORT}...")
                    ec2.authorize_security_group_ingress(
                        GroupId=sg['GroupId'],
                        IpProtocol=permission['IpProtocol'],
                        FromPort=permission['FromPort'],
                        ToPort=permission['ToPort'],
                        CidrIp=ALLOWED_IP_RANGE
                    )
```

### 4. **Run the Script**
Execute the script to automatically find and fix any security groups that allow unrestricted access to MongoDB.

```bash
python restrict_mongodb_access.py
```

### Summary
1. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure `boto3` is installed.
2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**: Configure your AWS credentials.
3. **Create a Python Script**: Use the provided script to identify and modify security groups.
4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to enforce the security changes.

This script will help you prevent unrestricted MongoDB access by modifying the security group rules to allow access only from specified IP ranges.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the EC2 dashboard, select "Security Groups" under the "Network & Security" section.
3. In the Security Groups page, select the security group associated with your MongoDB instance.
4. In the details pane, check the inbound rules for the security group. If there are any rules that allow inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 (all IP addresses) to port 27017 (the default port for MongoDB), then unrestricted MongoDB access is allowed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to list all the security groups in your AWS environment. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId]' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all security group IDs.

2. Next, for each security group, you need to check the inbound rules to see if there are any rules that allow unrestricted access to MongoDB. MongoDB typically uses port 27017, so you need to look for rules that allow traffic on this port. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <Security_Group_ID> --query 'SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions[*].{FromPort:FromPort,ToPort:ToPort,IpRanges:IpRanges[*].CidrIp}' --output text
   ```
   Replace `<Security_Group_ID>` with the ID of the security group you want to check. This command will return a list of all inbound rules for the specified security group.

3. Check the output of the previous command. If you see a rule that allows traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 (which means all IP addresses) on port 27017, then this means that unrestricted MongoDB access is allowed.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each security group in your AWS environment. If you have many security groups, you may want to automate this process by writing a script.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You will need the `boto3` library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Establish a session: The next step is to establish a session with AWS. You will need your access key, secret access key, and the region. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='YOUR_REGION'
   )
   ec2 = session.resource('ec2')
   ```

3. Get the security groups: Now, you can get the security groups and check if they allow unrestricted access to MongoDB. MongoDB uses port 27017, so you need to check if this port is open to the world (0.0.0.0/0). Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   for security_group in ec2.security_groups.all():
       for permission in security_group.ip_permissions:
           for ip_range in permission['IpRanges']:
               if '0.0.0.0/0' in ip_range['CidrIp'] and permission['FromPort'] <= 27017 and permission['ToPort'] >= 27017:
                   print(f"Security group {security_group.id} allows unrestricted MongoDB access.")
   ```

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run the script. If there are any security groups that allow unrestricted MongoDB access, they will be printed out. If there are no such security groups, nothing will be printed out. This script only checks for IPv4 addresses. If you also want to check for IPv6 addresses, you need to check the 'Ipv6Ranges' field in the same way.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate unrestricted MongoDB access in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.
2. Run the following command to list all the MongoDB instances running in your AWS account:
```
aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,Engine]' --filters "Name=engine,Values=mongodb"
```
3. Identify the MongoDB instances that have unrestricted access.
4. Run the following command to modify the security group associated with the MongoDB instance to allow access only from specific IP addresses:
```
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <db-instance-identifier> --vpc-security-group-ids <security-group-id>
```
Note: Replace `<db-instance-identifier>` with the identifier of the MongoDB instance and `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group that allows access only from specific IP addresses.
5. Verify the changes by running the following command:
```
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <db-instance-identifier> --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,VpcSecurityGroups[0].VpcSecurityGroupId]'
```
Note: Replace `<db-instance-identifier>` with the identifier of the MongoDB instance.

After these steps, the MongoDB instance will only allow access from specific IP addresses.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate unrestricted MongoDB access in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the MongoDB instances running in your AWS environment.
2. For each instance, check if the security group associated with it allows unrestricted access to the MongoDB port (default port is 27017).
3. If the security group allows unrestricted access, update the security group to restrict access to the MongoDB port to only the necessary IP addresses or CIDR ranges.
4. You can use the boto3 library in Python to interact with the AWS API and perform the above steps.

Here's a sample Python code that can help you remediate the issue:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the AWS client
client = boto3.client('ec2')

# Get a list of all MongoDB instances
response = client.describe_instances(
    Filters=[
        {
            'Name': 'tag:Name',
            'Values': ['*mongodb*']
        }
    ]
)

# Loop through each instance and update its security group
for reservation in response['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        for sg in instance['SecurityGroups']:
            # Check if the security group allows unrestricted access to MongoDB port
            ip_permissions = sg['IpPermissions']
            unrestricted_access = False
            for permission in ip_permissions:
                if permission['IpProtocol'] == 'tcp' and permission['FromPort'] == 27017 and permission['ToPort'] == 27017:
                    for ip_range in permission['IpRanges']:
                        if ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                            unrestricted_access = True
                            break
            
            # If unrestricted access is allowed, update the security group
            if unrestricted_access:
                response = client.authorize_security_group_ingress(
                    GroupId=sg['GroupId'],
                    IpPermissions=[
                        {
                            'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
                            'FromPort': 27017,
                            'ToPort': 27017,
                            'IpRanges': [
                                {
                                    'CidrIp': '10.0.0.0/8' # Replace with the necessary IP addresses or CIDR ranges
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                )
                print(response)
```

Note: This is just a sample code and may need to be modified based on your specific AWS environment and requirements. It's recommended to test the code in a non-production environment before applying it to your production environment.
