How to ensure EC2 instances have required tenancy

#### Using AWS Console

1. Determine the Required Tenancy:
   - Identify the specific tenancy requirements for your EC2 instances based on your workload's needs and compliance requirements.
   - Determine if you need dedicated instances (single-tenant) or host tenancy (dedicated physical servers).
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "EC2 Instance Tenancy" Policy.)
2. Launch EC2 Instances with the Required Tenancy:
   - Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
   - Click on "Launch Instances" to start the instance creation process.
   - Select the desired Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that matches your requirements.
   - Choose the instance type and configure other settings as per your workload needs.
   - In the "Configure Instance Details" section, scroll down to the "Tenancy" option.
   - Choose the appropriate tenancy option (e.g., Dedicated, Dedicated host) based on your requirements.
   - Continue with the remaining steps of the instance launch process, such as specifying storage, adding tags, configuring security groups, and reviewing the instance details.
   - Click on "Launch" to create the EC2 instance with the required tenancy.
3. Validate the Tenancy:
   - Once the EC2 instances are launched, you can validate their tenancy by accessing the EC2 dashboard.
   - Select the launched instances and check the "Tenancy" column to ensure it matches the desired tenancy type (e.g., dedicated or host).
