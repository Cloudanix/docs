<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of AWS Client VPN Authorization Rules not being enabled to authorize all clients, you can follow these steps using the AWS CLI:

1. List the existing authorization rules for the AWS Client VPN endpoint:
```
aws ec2 describe-client-vpn-authorization-rules --client-vpn-endpoint-id <client-vpn-endpoint-id>
```

2. Identify the existing authorization rules that need to be updated to authorize all clients.

3. Update the authorization rules to authorize all clients by adding a new rule with CIDR range `0.0.0.0/0`:
```
aws ec2 authorize-client-vpn-ingress --client-vpn-endpoint-id <client-vpn-endpoint-id> --target-network-cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

4. Verify that the new authorization rule has been successfully added by listing the authorization rules again:
```
aws ec2 describe-client-vpn-authorization-rules --client-vpn-endpoint-id <client-vpn-endpoint-id>
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of AWS Client VPN Authorization Rules not authorizing all clients on an AWS EC2 instance using the AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of AWS Client VPN Authorization Rules not being enabled to authorize all clients for AWS EC2 using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary Python libraries:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Initialize the AWS EC2 client:
```python
ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Describe the existing Client VPN endpoints:
```python
response = ec2_client.describe_client_vpn_endpoints()
```

4. Get the Client VPN endpoint ID:
```python
endpoint_id = response['ClientVpnEndpoints'][0]['ClientVpnEndpointId']
```

5. Update the Client VPN endpoint authorization rules to allow all clients:
```python
response = ec2_client.modify_client_vpn_endpoint(
    ClientVpnEndpointId=endpoint_id,
    SplitTunnel=True,
    ClientConnectOptions={
        'Enabled': True
    }
)
```

6. Verify that the authorization rules have been updated successfully:
```python
response = ec2_client.describe_client_vpn_endpoints()
authorization_rules = response['ClientVpnEndpoints'][0]['ClientConnectOptions']['Enabled']
if authorization_rules:
    print("Client VPN authorization rules have been successfully updated to allow all clients.")
else:
    print("Failed to update Client VPN authorization rules.")
```

By following these steps and running the Python script, you can remediate the misconfiguration of AWS Client VPN Authorization Rules not being enabled to authorize all clients for AWS EC2.
