How to ensure security groups port range is not open for public?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
2. From the left navigation pane, click on "Security Groups" to view the list of security groups.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Security Group Port Range" Policy.)
3. Identify the security group that you want to check for open ports to the public and select it by clicking on its name.
4. In the "Inbound Rules" tab of the security group details, review the list of inbound rules.
5. Identify any rules with a port range that should not be open to the public. This typically includes common ports like 22 (SSH), 3389 (RDP), or any other specific ports that should only be accessible from specific IP addresses or networks.
6. To close the port range to the public, select the rule by clicking on the corresponding row.
7. Click on the "Actions" button above the rule list and choose "Delete Rule" or "Remove" to remove the rule.
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 for each rule that needs to be closed to the public.
9. Once you have removed the appropriate rules, click on the "Save Rules" or "Save" button to apply the changes to the security group.
