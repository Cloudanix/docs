### More Info:

Ensure that all Amazon EC2 instances are managed by AWS Systems Manager (SSM). Systems Manager simplifies AWS cloud resource management, shortens the time to detect and resolve operational problems, and makes it easy to operate and manage your instances securely at scale. For Amazon EC2 instances to be monitored and managed with AWS Systems Manager service, they must be configured as managed instances. In order for EC2 instances to be managed by Systems Manager and be available in the list of managed instances, your instances have to meet 3 primary requirements:

### Risk Level

High

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

How to ensure EC2 instances are managed by SSM

#### Using AWS Console

To ensure EC2 instances are managed by Systems Manager (SSM), you can follow these steps:

1. Verify that the EC2 instances have the required IAM role: Ensure that the EC2 instances are associated with an IAM role that has the necessary permissions to communicate with SSM. The role should have the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` managed policy attached.

2. Install the SSM Agent on EC2 instances: SSM Agent is the component that enables EC2 instances to communicate with SSM. Ensure that the SSM Agent is installed and running on the EC2 instances. The agent is pre-installed on Amazon Linux 2, Windows Server 2016 and later AMIs. For other operating systems, you may need to manually install the agent.

3. Confirm EC2 instance connectivity: Ensure that the EC2 instances have outbound internet connectivity to communicate with the SSM service. Check the security group rules, network ACLs, and internet gateway settings to allow the necessary traffic.

4. Check the EC2 instance status in the SSM console: Open the AWS Management Console, navigate to the Systems Manager service, and select "Managed Instances" in the left navigation pane. Verify that the EC2 instances are listed as "Managed" and have a status of "Online". If an instance is not listed or has an "Offline" status, it may not be properly configured for SSM.

5. Validate SSM commands and automation documents: Test the functionality of SSM by running commands or executing automation documents on the managed EC2 instances. This will help ensure that the instances can receive and execute commands or perform automation tasks through SSM.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your EC2 instances are properly managed by Systems Manager, allowing you to perform various management tasks such as running commands, patching, and configuration management remotely through SSM.
