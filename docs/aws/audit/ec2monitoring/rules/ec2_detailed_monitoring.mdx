### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

2. In the navigation pane, under "INSTANCES" section, click on "Instances".

3. In the "Instances" page, select the EC2 instance that you want to examine, then click on the "Monitoring" tab from the bottom panel.

4. In the "CloudWatch Monitoring" section, check the "Detailed Monitoring" status. If the status is "Disabled", then the detailed monitoring for the selected EC2 instance is not enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 instances: Use the following command to list all the EC2 instances in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId' --output text
   ```

3. Check detailed monitoring for each instance: For each instance ID that you got from the previous step, run the following command to check if detailed monitoring is enabled.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id> --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].Monitoring'
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the actual instance ID. This command will return the monitoring details for the specified EC2 instance.

4. Analyze the output: If detailed monitoring is enabled, the output of the above command will include `"State": "enabled"`. If it's not enabled, the state will be `"disabled"`. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each instance ID to check detailed monitoring for all EC2 instances.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3, AWS EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```
After installation, you need to configure it. You can do this in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```
This will prompt you for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, AWS Region, and output format. 

2. Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```
Replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', and 'YOUR_REGION' with your actual AWS access key, secret key, and region.

3. Create an EC2 resource object using the session:

```python
ec2_resource = session.resource('ec2')
```
4. Use the EC2 resource object to retrieve all instances and check if detailed monitoring is enabled:

```python
for instance in ec2_resource.instances.all():
    if instance.monitoring['State'] == 'disabled':
        print(f"Instance {instance.id} has detailed monitoring disabled.")
```
This script will print the IDs of all instances that have detailed monitoring disabled. If no output is produced, it means that all instances have detailed monitoring enabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Detailed Monitoring for EC2 Instances Should Be Enabled" for AWS using AWS console, please follow the below steps:

Step 1: Login to AWS console using your credentials.

Step 2: Go to the EC2 dashboard by clicking on the EC2 service from the AWS console home page.

Step 3: From the left-hand side panel, select "Instances" to view all the instances in the region.

Step 4: Select the instance for which you want to enable detailed monitoring.

Step 5: Right-click on the instance and select "Monitor and troubleshoot" from the drop-down list.

Step 6: Click on "Enable detailed monitoring" from the list.

Step 7: A pop-up will appear asking you to confirm the action, click on "Enable" to enable detailed monitoring.

Step 8: Once the detailed monitoring is enabled, you can view the metrics by selecting the instance and clicking on the "Monitoring" tab from the bottom panel.

Step 9: You can also enable detailed monitoring for multiple instances at once by selecting them and clicking on the "Actions" button from the top panel and selecting "Monitor with CloudWatch" from the drop-down list.

Step 10: Click on "Enable detailed monitoring" and confirm the action.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Detailed Monitoring for EC2 Instances Should Be Enabled" for AWS using AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Detailed Monitoring for EC2 Instances Should Be Enabled" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow the steps below:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to enable detailed monitoring for all EC2 instances in the default region:

```
aws ec2 monitor-instances --instance-ids $(aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId' --output text)
```

This command uses the `aws ec2 describe-instances` command to list all EC2 instances in the default region, and the `aws ec2 monitor-instances` command to enable detailed monitoring for each instance.

3. If you want to enable detailed monitoring for specific instances, you can replace `$(aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId' --output text)` with a comma-separated list of instance IDs.

```
aws ec2 monitor-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0,i-0987654321fedcba0
```

4. Verify that detailed monitoring is enabled for the instances by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids $(aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId' --output text) --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].Monitoring.State'
```

This command uses the `aws ec2 describe-instances` command to list the monitoring state for each instance.

If the monitoring state is `disabled`, wait a few minutes and run the command again to verify that it has been enabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Detailed Monitoring for EC2 Instances Should Be Enabled" misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of detailed monitoring for EC2 instances not being enabled in AWS using python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```
import boto3
```

2. Create a boto3 client for EC2:
```
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Get a list of all EC2 instances:
```
instances = ec2.describe_instances()
```

4. Loop through each instance and check if detailed monitoring is enabled or not:
```
for reservation in instances['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
        monitoring = instance['Monitoring']['State']
        if monitoring == 'disabled':
            # Enable detailed monitoring for the instance
            ec2.monitor_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
```

5. If detailed monitoring is disabled for an instance, enable it using the `monitor_instances` method of the EC2 client.

6. Once detailed monitoring is enabled, you can verify it by checking the monitoring state of the instance using the `describe_instances` method.

7. You can also create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the status of detailed monitoring for all EC2 instances and get notified if it is disabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of detailed monitoring for EC2 instances not being enabled in AWS using python.
