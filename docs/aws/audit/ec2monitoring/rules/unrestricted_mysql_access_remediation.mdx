### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under NETWORK & SECURITY, click Security Groups.
3. In the Security Groups page, select the security group that you want to examine.
4. In the lower panel, select the Inbound tab to view the inbound rules. Look for rules that allow traffic (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 in the Source column) to port 3306 (the default port for MySQL).
5. If such rules exist, it means that unrestricted MySQL access is allowed.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to list all the security groups in your AWS environment. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId]' --output text
```

2. Once you have the list of all security groups, you need to check the inbound rules for each security group. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query 'SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions[*]' --output json
```
Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group you want to check.

3. In the output of the above command, look for any rules that allow inbound traffic to port 3306 (the default port for MySQL) from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0). 

4. If you find any such rules, it means that unrestricted MySQL access is allowed in that security group.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   First, you need to install Boto3. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3`. After installing Boto3, you need to configure it. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. Get a list of all EC2 instances:
   Use the `describe_instances()` function to get a list of all EC2 instances. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   response = ec2.describe_instances()

   for reservation in response["Reservations"]:
       for instance in reservation["Instances"]:
           # This sample print will output entire Dictionary object
           print(instance)
           # This will print will output the value of the Dictionary key 'InstanceId'
           print(instance["InstanceId"])
   ```

3. Check the security groups of each instance:
   For each instance, get the security groups it belongs to and check the inbound rules. If a rule allows unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) to port 3306 (MySQL), then it is a misconfiguration. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   response = ec2.describe_security_groups()

   for security_group in response['SecurityGroups']:
       for rule in security_group['IpPermissions']:
           for ip_range in rule['IpRanges']:
               if 'FromPort' in rule and 'ToPort' in rule and rule['FromPort'] <= 3306 <= rule['ToPort'] and ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                   print(f"Security group {security_group['GroupName']} ({security_group['GroupId']}) allows unrestricted MySQL access.")
   ```

4. Run the script:
   Save the script to a file, for example, `check_mysql_access.py`, and then run it with the command `python check_mysql_access.py`. If there are any instances with misconfigurations, their IDs will be printed to the console.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the unrestricted MySQL access issue in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to AWS console.
2. Go to the RDS service.
3. Select the DB instance with unrestricted MySQL access.
4. Click on the "Modify" button.
5. Scroll down to the "Network & Security" section.
6. In the "Security Group" section, select the security group associated with the DB instance.
7. Click on the "Remove" button to remove the inbound rule that allows unrestricted access to MySQL.
8. Add a new inbound rule to the security group that allows access only from specific IP addresses or CIDR blocks.
9. Click on the "Save Changes" button to apply the changes.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the unrestricted MySQL access issue in AWS and ensure that your database is secure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the unrestricted MySQL access issue in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to list all the security groups in your AWS account:
```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups
```
Step 2: Identify the security group that has unrestricted MySQL access. You can filter the results using the following command:
```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=ip-permission.protocol,Values=tcp Name=ip-permission.to-port,Values=3306 Name=ip-permission.cidr,Values='0.0.0.0/0'
```
This command will list all the security groups that have unrestricted MySQL access.

Step 3: Once you have identified the security group, run the following command to revoke the MySQL access:
```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 3306 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```
Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group that you want to remediate.

Step 4: Verify that the MySQL access has been revoked by running the following command:
```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>
```
This command will list the details of the security group that you have remediated.

That's it. You have successfully remediated the unrestricted MySQL access issue in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate unrestricted MySQL access in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Create an AWS client for the RDS service:

```
rds = boto3.client('rds')
```

3. Get a list of all RDS instances:

```
try:
    response = rds.describe_db_instances()
    instances = response['DBInstances']
except ClientError as e:
    print(e)
    exit(1)
```

4. Loop through each RDS instance and modify its security group to remove unrestricted MySQL access:

```
for instance in instances:
    db_instance_identifier = instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']
    db_security_groups = instance['DBSecurityGroups']
    for security_group in db_security_groups:
        if security_group['DBSecurityGroupName'] == 'default':
            try:
                response = rds.revoke_db_security_group_ingress(
                    DBSecurityGroupName='default',
                    EC2SecurityGroupId=security_group['EC2SecurityGroups'][0]['EC2SecurityGroupId'],
                    CIDRIP='0.0.0.0/0',
                    DBProtocol='tcp',
                    DBPortNumber=3306
                )
                print(f"Revoked unrestricted MySQL access for {db_instance_identifier}")
            except ClientError as e:
                print(e)
                exit(1)
```

This code will loop through each RDS instance and its associated security groups. If the default security group is found, it will revoke any inbound rules that allow unrestricted MySQL access (i.e. from any IP address). The code will print a message for each instance where unrestricted MySQL access was revoked.
