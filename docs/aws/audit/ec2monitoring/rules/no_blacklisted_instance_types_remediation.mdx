### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent EC2 instances from using blacklisted instance types in AWS using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Create an IAM Policy:**
   - Navigate to the IAM service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click on "Policies" in the left-hand menu and then click "Create policy."
   - Use the JSON editor to define a policy that denies the creation of EC2 instances with the blacklisted instance types. For example:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Deny",
           "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
           "Condition": {
             "StringEquals": {
               "ec2:InstanceType": [
                 "t2.micro",
                 "m1.small"
               ]
             }
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Click "Review policy," give it a name and description, and then click "Create policy."

2. **Attach the IAM Policy to Users/Roles:**
   - Go to the "Users" or "Roles" section in the IAM console.
   - Select the user or role to which you want to attach the policy.
   - Click on the "Add permissions" button, then "Attach policies."
   - Search for the policy you created and select it, then click "Next: Review" and "Add permissions."

3. **Set Up AWS Config Rules:**
   - Navigate to the AWS Config service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click on "Rules" in the left-hand menu and then click "Add rule."
   - Search for and select the "ec2-instance-type-blacklist" managed rule.
   - Configure the rule by specifying the blacklisted instance types and click "Save."

4. **Enable CloudTrail for Monitoring:**
   - Navigate to the CloudTrail service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Ensure that CloudTrail is enabled to log API activity.
   - Create a trail if one does not exist, and configure it to log to an S3 bucket and optionally to CloudWatch Logs for real-time monitoring.
   - This will help you monitor any attempts to create instances with blacklisted types and take corrective actions if necessary.

By following these steps, you can effectively prevent the use of blacklisted instance types in your AWS environment using the AWS Management Console.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent EC2 instances from using blacklisted instance types using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create an IAM Policy to Deny Blacklisted Instance Types:**
   - Create a JSON policy that denies the creation of specific instance types. Save this policy in a file, e.g., `deny-blacklisted-instance-types.json`.

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Deny",
         "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
         "Condition": {
           "StringEquals": {
             "ec2:InstanceType": [
               "t2.micro",
               "m1.small"
               // Add other blacklisted instance types here
             ]
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Create the IAM Policy Using AWS CLI:**
   - Use the `aws iam create-policy` command to create the policy in AWS.

   ```sh
   aws iam create-policy --policy-name DenyBlacklistedInstanceTypes --policy-document file://deny-blacklisted-instance-types.json
   ```

3. **Attach the Policy to IAM Users, Groups, or Roles:**
   - Attach the created policy to the relevant IAM users, groups, or roles that are responsible for launching EC2 instances.

   ```sh
   aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <username> --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:policy/DenyBlacklistedInstanceTypes
   ```

   Or for a group:

   ```sh
   aws iam attach-group-policy --group-name <groupname> --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:policy/DenyBlacklistedInstanceTypes
   ```

   Or for a role:

   ```sh
   aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name <rolename> --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:policy/DenyBlacklistedInstanceTypes
   ```

4. **Verify the Policy Attachment:**
   - Ensure that the policy is correctly attached to the intended IAM entities by listing the attached policies.

   For a user:

   ```sh
   aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name <username>
   ```

   For a group:

   ```sh
   aws iam list-attached-group-policies --group-name <groupname>
   ```

   For a role:

   ```sh
   aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name <rolename>
   ```

By following these steps, you can prevent the creation of EC2 instances with blacklisted instance types using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent EC2 instances from using blacklisted instance types using Python scripts, you can leverage the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Set Up Boto3 and AWS Credentials:**
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed and configured with your AWS credentials.

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

   Configure your AWS credentials:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Define Blacklisted Instance Types:**
   Create a list of blacklisted instance types that you want to prevent.

   ```python
   blacklisted_instance_types = ['t2.micro', 'm1.small', 'c1.medium']
   ```

3. **Check Existing Instances:**
   Write a script to check existing EC2 instances and ensure none of them are using blacklisted instance types.

   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   def check_instances():
       response = ec2.describe_instances()
       for reservation in response['Reservations']:
           for instance in reservation['Instances']:
               instance_type = instance['InstanceType']
               instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
               if instance_type in blacklisted_instance_types:
                   print(f"Instance {instance_id} is using a blacklisted instance type: {instance_type}")

   check_instances()
   ```

4. **Prevent Launching Blacklisted Instance Types:**
   Implement a script to prevent the creation of new instances with blacklisted instance types by using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Events to trigger the script on instance launch.

   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       instance_id = event['detail']['instance-id']
       response = ec2.describe_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
       instance_type = response['Reservations'][0]['Instances'][0]['InstanceType']
       
       if instance_type in blacklisted_instance_types:
           print(f"Terminating instance {instance_id} with blacklisted instance type: {instance_type}")
           ec2.terminate_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])

   # Example event to test the function locally
   test_event = {
       'detail': {
           'instance-id': 'i-1234567890abcdef0'
       }
   }

   lambda_handler(test_event, None)
   ```

   Note: To fully implement this in a production environment, you would need to set up an AWS Lambda function and a CloudWatch Events rule to trigger the Lambda function on EC2 instance state changes.

By following these steps, you can prevent the use of blacklisted instance types in your AWS environment using Python scripts.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "INSTANCES", click on "Instances".
3. In the Instances dashboard, you will see a list of all your instances. Check the "Instance Type" column for each instance.
4. If any of the instances are of a type that is blacklisted, it indicates a misconfiguration. You can cross-verify this with your organization's policy on allowed instance types.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 instances: Use the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 describe-instances` to list all the EC2 instances in your account. This command will return a JSON output with details of all your EC2 instances.

3. Filter instances by instance type: You can filter the instances by their instance type using the `--query` option in the AWS CLI command. For example, if you want to check for instances of type 't2.micro', you can use the command `aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,InstanceType]' --output text | grep t2.micro`.

4. Check against blacklist: Once you have the list of instances and their types, you can check this against your blacklist of instance types. This can be done manually or you can write a script to automate this process. If any of the instance types match with the types in your blacklist, then those instances are misconfigured.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install Boto3 in your Python environment. You can do this using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing Boto3, you need to configure it with your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. Create a Python script to list all EC2 instances:
   You can use Boto3 to interact with AWS services. Here is a simple script that lists all EC2 instances:
   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

   for instance in ec2.instances.all():
       print(instance.id, instance.instance_type)
   ```

3. Check for blacklisted instance types:
   You can modify the script to check if any of the instances are using blacklisted instance types. Here is an example where 't2.micro' and 't2.small' are considered as blacklisted:
   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

   blacklisted_types = ['t2.micro', 't2.small']

   for instance in ec2.instances.all():
       if instance.instance_type in blacklisted_types:
           print(f"Instance {instance.id} is using blacklisted instance type {instance.instance_type}")
   ```

4. Run the script:
   You can run the script using Python command line:
   ```
   python check_ec2_instance_types.py
   ```
   This will print out the IDs of all instances that are using blacklisted instance types.

#
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Instances Should Not Have Blacklisted Instance Types" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Identify the blacklisted instance types that are currently running in your AWS account. You can use the following AWS CLI command to list all the running instances and their instance types:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId, InstanceType]'
   ```

2. From the list of instance types, identify the blacklisted instance types that need to be terminated.

3. Use the following AWS CLI command to terminate the instances with the blacklisted instance types. Replace the "instance-id" with the actual instance ID of the instance that needs to be terminated.

   ```
   aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids instance-id
   ```

4. Once the instances are terminated, you can update your AWS account to prevent the blacklisted instance types from being launched in the future. To do this, you can create an AWS Config rule that checks for the use of blacklisted instance types and alerts you if any are found. 

   You can use the following AWS CLI command to create an AWS Config rule that checks for the use of blacklisted instance types:

   ```
   aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule '{"Source": {"Owner": "AWS", "SourceIdentifier": "EC2_BLACKLISTED_INSTANCE_TYPES"}, "Scope": {"ComplianceResourceTypes": ["AWS::EC2::Instance"]}}'
   ```

   This will create an AWS Config rule that checks for the use of blacklisted instance types in EC2 instances and alerts you if any are found.

5. Finally, you can monitor your AWS account to ensure that blacklisted instance types are not launched in the future. You can use AWS Config to continuously monitor your account for compliance with the rule you created in step 4. If any non-compliant resources are found, AWS Config will alert you so that you can take remedial action.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the "EC2 Instances Should Not Have Blacklisted Instance Types" misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the list of blacklisted instance types that should not be allowed in your AWS account. For example, you can use the following list:

```
blacklisted_instance_types = ['t1.micro', 'm1.small', 'c1.medium']
```

2. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to retrieve a list of all EC2 instances in your AWS account. You can do this by creating an EC2 client and calling the `describe_instances` method:

```
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
response = ec2.describe_instances()
```

3. Loop through the list of instances and check if any of them are using a blacklisted instance type. You can do this by looking at the `InstanceType` attribute of each instance:

```
for reservation in response['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        if instance['InstanceType'] in blacklisted_instance_types:
            # This instance is using a blacklisted instance type
            # We need to stop and terminate it
```

4. If you find an instance that is using a blacklisted instance type, stop and terminate it. You can do this by calling the `stop_instances` and `terminate_instances` methods:

```
instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
ec2.terminate_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
```

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all instances in your AWS account.

6. Once you have remediated all instances using blacklisted instance types, you can update your AWS account configuration to prevent new instances from using these types. You can do this by creating an AWS Config rule that checks for this misconfiguration and triggers an AWS Lambda function to remediate it automatically.
