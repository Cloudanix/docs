1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "INSTANCES", click on "Instances".
3. In the Instances dashboard, you will see a list of all your instances. Check the "Instance Type" column for each instance.
4. If any of the instances are of a type that is blacklisted, it indicates a misconfiguration. You can cross-verify this with your organization's policy on allowed instance types.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 instances: Use the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 describe-instances` to list all the EC2 instances in your account. This command will return a JSON output with details of all your EC2 instances.

3. Filter instances by instance type: You can filter the instances by their instance type using the `--query` option in the AWS CLI command. For example, if you want to check for instances of type 't2.micro', you can use the command `aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,InstanceType]' --output text | grep t2.micro`.

4. Check against blacklist: Once you have the list of instances and their types, you can check this against your blacklist of instance types. This can be done manually or you can write a script to automate this process. If any of the instance types match with the types in your blacklist, then those instances are misconfigured.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install Boto3 in your Python environment. You can do this using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing Boto3, you need to configure it with your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. Create a Python script to list all EC2 instances:
   You can use Boto3 to interact with AWS services. Here is a simple script that lists all EC2 instances:
   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

   for instance in ec2.instances.all():
       print(instance.id, instance.instance_type)
   ```

3. Check for blacklisted instance types:
   You can modify the script to check if any of the instances are using blacklisted instance types. Here is an example where 't2.micro' and 't2.small' are considered as blacklisted:
   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

   blacklisted_types = ['t2.micro', 't2.small']

   for instance in ec2.instances.all():
       if instance.instance_type in blacklisted_types:
           print(f"Instance {instance.id} is using blacklisted instance type {instance.instance_type}")
   ```

4. Run the script:
   You can run the script using Python command line:
   ```
   python check_ec2_instance_types.py
   ```
   This will print out the IDs of all instances that are using blacklisted instance types.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the issue of EC2 Instances having blacklisted instance types in AWS:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. Click on the "Instances" link in the left-hand navigation menu.
3. Select the EC2 instance that has a blacklisted instance type.
4. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Instance Settings" from the drop-down menu.
5. Click on "Change Instance Type" from the Instance Settings menu.
6. Select a different instance type that is not blacklisted.
7. Click on "Apply" to save the changes.
8. Verify that the instance type has been changed successfully.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the issue of EC2 instances having blacklisted instance types in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Instances Should Not Have Blacklisted Instance Types" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Identify the blacklisted instance types that are currently running in your AWS account. You can use the following AWS CLI command to list all the running instances and their instance types:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId, InstanceType]'
   ```

2. From the list of instance types, identify the blacklisted instance types that need to be terminated.

3. Use the following AWS CLI command to terminate the instances with the blacklisted instance types. Replace the "instance-id" with the actual instance ID of the instance that needs to be terminated.

   ```
   aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids instance-id
   ```

4. Once the instances are terminated, you can update your AWS account to prevent the blacklisted instance types from being launched in the future. To do this, you can create an AWS Config rule that checks for the use of blacklisted instance types and alerts you if any are found. 

   You can use the following AWS CLI command to create an AWS Config rule that checks for the use of blacklisted instance types:

   ```
   aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule '{"Source": {"Owner": "AWS", "SourceIdentifier": "EC2_BLACKLISTED_INSTANCE_TYPES"}, "Scope": {"ComplianceResourceTypes": ["AWS::EC2::Instance"]}}'
   ```

   This will create an AWS Config rule that checks for the use of blacklisted instance types in EC2 instances and alerts you if any are found.

5. Finally, you can monitor your AWS account to ensure that blacklisted instance types are not launched in the future. You can use AWS Config to continuously monitor your account for compliance with the rule you created in step 4. If any non-compliant resources are found, AWS Config will alert you so that you can take remedial action.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the "EC2 Instances Should Not Have Blacklisted Instance Types" misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the list of blacklisted instance types that should not be allowed in your AWS account. For example, you can use the following list:

```
blacklisted_instance_types = ['t1.micro', 'm1.small', 'c1.medium']
```

2. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to retrieve a list of all EC2 instances in your AWS account. You can do this by creating an EC2 client and calling the `describe_instances` method:

```
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
response = ec2.describe_instances()
```

3. Loop through the list of instances and check if any of them are using a blacklisted instance type. You can do this by looking at the `InstanceType` attribute of each instance:

```
for reservation in response['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        if instance['InstanceType'] in blacklisted_instance_types:
            # This instance is using a blacklisted instance type
            # We need to stop and terminate it
```

4. If you find an instance that is using a blacklisted instance type, stop and terminate it. You can do this by calling the `stop_instances` and `terminate_instances` methods:

```
instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
ec2.terminate_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
```

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all instances in your AWS account.

6. Once you have remediated all instances using blacklisted instance types, you can update your AWS account configuration to prevent new instances from using these types. You can do this by creating an AWS Config rule that checks for this misconfiguration and triggers an AWS Lambda function to remediate it automatically.
