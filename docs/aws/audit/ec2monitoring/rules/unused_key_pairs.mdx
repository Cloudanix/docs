### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent unused AWS EC2 Key Pairs from accumulating and potentially posing a security risk, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Identify Unused Key Pairs:**
   - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
   - In the left-hand navigation pane, click on "Key Pairs" under the "Network & Security" section.
   - Review the list of key pairs and identify any that are not associated with any active EC2 instances.

2. **Verify Key Pair Usage:**
   - For each key pair, cross-check its usage by reviewing the EC2 instances.
   - Go to the "Instances" section in the EC2 Dashboard.
   - Filter instances by the key pair name to ensure that the key pair is not in use.

3. **Document Key Pairs:**
   - Maintain a record of key pairs and their associated instances.
   - This documentation helps in tracking and verifying the necessity of each key pair.

4. **Regular Audits:**
   - Schedule regular audits to review and verify the usage of key pairs.
   - Ensure that any unused key pairs are identified promptly for removal.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and prevent the accumulation of unused EC2 key pairs in your AWS environment.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent unused AWS EC2 Key Pairs from accumulating, you can follow these steps using the AWS CLI:

1. **List All Key Pairs:**
   First, list all the existing key pairs to identify which ones are currently in use and which ones are not.
   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-key-pairs --query 'KeyPairs[*].KeyName'
   ```

2. **Identify Unused Key Pairs:**
   Manually cross-reference the listed key pairs with the key pairs currently in use by your EC2 instances. You can list all running instances and their associated key pairs using:
   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].KeyName'
   ```

3. **Tag Key Pairs:**
   To keep track of which key pairs are in use, you can tag them. This helps in identifying unused key pairs in the future.
   ```sh
   aws ec2 create-tags --resources <key-pair-name> --tags Key=Status,Value=InUse
   ```

4. **Automate Cleanup:**
   Write a script to automate the identification and deletion of unused key pairs. Here is a basic example in Python using Boto3:
   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   # List all key pairs
   key_pairs = ec2.describe_key_pairs()['KeyPairs']

   # List all instances and their key pairs
   instances = ec2.describe_instances()
   used_key_pairs = set()
   for reservation in instances['Reservations']:
       for instance in reservation['Instances']:
           if 'KeyName' in instance:
               used_key_pairs.add(instance['KeyName'])

   # Identify and delete unused key pairs
   for key_pair in key_pairs:
       if key_pair['KeyName'] not in used_key_pairs:
           print(f"Deleting unused key pair: {key_pair['KeyName']}")
           ec2.delete_key_pair(KeyName=key_pair['KeyName'])
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and prevent the accumulation of unused EC2 key pairs in AWS.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent unused AWS EC2 key pairs from accumulating, you can use a Python script to identify and remove them. Below are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   - Ensure you have Boto3 installed. If not, install it using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install boto3
     ```

2. **Authenticate and Initialize Boto3 Client:**
   - Set up your AWS credentials and initialize the EC2 client in your Python script.
     ```python
     import boto3

     # Initialize a session using Amazon EC2
     session = boto3.Session(
         aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
         aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
         region_name='YOUR_REGION'
     )

     ec2_client = session.client('ec2')
     ```

3. **List All Key Pairs and Identify Unused Ones:**
   - Fetch all key pairs and determine which ones are not associated with any running instances.
     ```python
     def get_unused_key_pairs():
         # Get all key pairs
         key_pairs = ec2_client.describe_key_pairs()
         key_pair_names = [kp['KeyName'] for kp in key_pairs['KeyPairs']]

         # Get all instances
         instances = ec2_client.describe_instances()
         used_key_pairs = set()

         for reservation in instances['Reservations']:
             for instance in reservation['Instances']:
                 if 'KeyName' in instance:
                     used_key_pairs.add(instance['KeyName'])

         # Identify unused key pairs
         unused_key_pairs = set(key_pair_names) - used_key_pairs
         return unused_key_pairs

     unused_key_pairs = get_unused_key_pairs()
     print("Unused Key Pairs:", unused_key_pairs)
     ```

4. **Remove Unused Key Pairs:**
   - Delete the identified unused key pairs.
     ```python
     def delete_unused_key_pairs(unused_key_pairs):
         for key_name in unused_key_pairs:
             try:
                 ec2_client.delete_key_pair(KeyName=key_name)
                 print(f"Deleted key pair: {key_name}")
             except Exception as e:
                 print(f"Error deleting key pair {key_name}: {e}")

     delete_unused_key_pairs(unused_key_pairs)
     ```

By following these steps, you can automate the process of identifying and removing unused EC2 key pairs using a Python script. This helps in maintaining a clean and secure AWS environment.

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu, then choosing "EC2" under the "Compute" category.
3. In the EC2 dashboard, under the "Network & Security" section in the left navigation pane, click on "Key Pairs".
4. Here, you can see all the key pairs associated with your AWS account. To identify unused key pairs, you need to cross-verify these key pairs with the ones associated with your EC2 instances. If a key pair is not associated with any running or stopped EC2 instances, it is considered unused.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all EC2 key pairs: Once your AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the EC2 key pairs associated with your AWS account by running the following command:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-key-pairs
   ```
   This command will return a list of all EC2 key pairs, including their names and fingerprints.

3. Check for unused key pairs: To check for unused key pairs, you need to list all EC2 instances and their associated key pairs. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[KeyName]' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all EC2 instances and their associated key pairs.

4. Compare the lists: Finally, you need to compare the list of all key pairs with the list of key pairs associated with EC2 instances. Any key pair that is in the first list but not in the second list is unused and should be removed. You can do this comparison manually or write a script to do it for you.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install Boto3 in your Python environment. You can do this using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing Boto3, you need to configure it with your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a file named `~/.aws/credentials`:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```
   And also create a file named `~/.aws/config`:
   ```
   [default]
   region=us-east-1
   ```

2. Use Boto3 to list all EC2 key pairs:
   You can use the `describe_key_pairs` method of the EC2 client in Boto3 to list all the key pairs. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   response = ec2.describe_key_pairs()

   print(response)
   ```
   This script will print all the key pairs in your AWS account.

3. Use Boto3 to list all EC2 instances:
   You can use the `describe_instances` method of the EC2 client in Boto3 to list all the EC2 instances. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   response = ec2.describe_instances()

   print(response)
   ```
   This script will print all the EC2 instances in your AWS account.

4. Compare the key pairs used by EC2 instances with the list of all key pairs:
   You can write a script that compares the key pairs used by the EC2 instances with the list of all key pairs. If a key pair is not used by any EC2 instance, it is unused and should be removed. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   response_key_pairs = ec2.describe_key_pairs()
   response_instances = ec2.describe_instances()

   used_key_pairs = set()
   for reservation in response_instances['Reservations']:
       for instance in reservation['Instances']:
           used_key_pairs.add(instance['KeyName'])

   all_key_pairs = set()
   for key_pair in response_key_pairs['KeyPairs']:
       all_key_pairs.add(key_pair['KeyName'])

   unused_key_pairs = all_key_pairs - used_key_pairs

   print(unused_key_pairs)
   ```
   This script will print all the unused key pairs in your AWS account.
