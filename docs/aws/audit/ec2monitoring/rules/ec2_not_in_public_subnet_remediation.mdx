How to move your backend EC2 instances from public subnets to private subnets?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: Create an image of the backend EC2 instance that you want to migrate. To instantiate the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), perform the following:
  A: Go to EC2 dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
  B: In the left navigation panel, under INSTANCES section, choose Instances. Select the backend instance that you want to move to the private subnet (see the Audit section part I section to identify the right resource).
  C: Click the Actions dropdown button from the dashboard top menu, select Image and click Create Image.
  D: Inside Create Image dialog box, provide the following information:
  a. Enter a name for the new AMI in the Image Name box.
  b. In the Image description box, provide a description that reflects the usage of the EC2 instance selected.
  c. Leave No reboot option unchecked so the AWS can guarantee the file system integrity for the new image.
  E: Click **Create Image** to submit the request to create the image. Click Close to return to the EC2 dashboard. The AMI creation may take few minutes. Once the process is complete the image status should change from pending to available.

- Step 2: Once the Amazon Machine Image is ready, use it to (re)launch the selected backend instance within your VPC private subnet. To launch the instance, perform the following actions:
  A: In the navigation panel, under the INSTANCES section, select Instances.
  B: Click the Launch Instance button from the EC2 dashboard top menu to initiate the rocess.
  C: On the Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) page, choose My AMIs tab then select the AMI created at step no. 2.
  D: On the Choose an Instance Type page, select the same instance type used then click Next: Configure Instance Details button.
  E: On the Configure Instance Details page, select the private subnet that you want to use from the Subnet dropdown list and configure any other options available on the page based on your running backend instance attributes. Click Next: Add Storage and go through the next pages until you reach the Configure Security Group page, without changing any configuration.
  F: On the Configure Security Groups, choose Select an existing security group and select the security group of the existing backend instance (i.e. the one running in the public subnet). Click the Review and Launch button, review your new instance configuration details and click Launch.
  G: In the Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair dialog box, select Choose an existing key pair and use the same key pair as the running backend EC2 instance. Check I acknowledge that I have access to the selected private key file option then click Launch Instances.
  H: Click View Instances to return to the Instances page. The new instance will have the same data and configuration (except the associated subnet) as the old backend instance.
- Step 3: Once you have verified and tested the new instance, it is safe to terminate the old backend EC2 instance in order to stop incurring charges for it. To shut down the instance, perform the following:
  A: In the navigation panel, under INSTANCES section, select Instances.
  B: Select the backend instance that you want to terminate.
  C: Click the Actions dropdown button from the dashboard top menu, select Instance State and click Terminate.
  D: In the Terminate Instances confirmation box, review the instance details then click Yes, Terminate.
