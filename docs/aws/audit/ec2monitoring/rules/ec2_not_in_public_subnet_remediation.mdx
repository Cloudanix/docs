### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent an EC2 instance from being in a public subnet using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Private Subnet:**
   - Navigate to the **VPC Dashboard**.
   - Select **Subnets** from the left-hand menu.
   - Click on **Create Subnet**.
   - Choose your VPC and specify the subnet details, ensuring that the subnet is configured to be private (i.e., it does not have a route to an Internet Gateway).

2. **Modify Route Tables:**
   - In the **VPC Dashboard**, select **Route Tables**.
   - Ensure that the route table associated with your private subnet does not have a route to an Internet Gateway. Instead, it should have routes to a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance if internet access is required for the instances.

3. **Launch EC2 Instance in Private Subnet:**
   - Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard**.
   - Click on **Launch Instance**.
   - In the **Network** section, select the VPC and the private subnet you created.
   - Complete the instance configuration and launch the instance.

4. **Security Group Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the security group associated with the EC2 instance does not allow inbound traffic from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) unless absolutely necessary and properly controlled.
   - Configure the security group to allow only necessary traffic from specific IP addresses or other security groups.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your EC2 instances are not placed in a public subnet, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent an EC2 instance from being in a public subnet using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a VPC:**
   Ensure you have a VPC where you can create private subnets. If you don't have one, create it using the following command:
   ```sh
   aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16
   ```

2. **Create a Private Subnet:**
   Create a subnet within the VPC that does not have an internet gateway attached, making it a private subnet.
   ```sh
   aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block 10.0.1.0/24
   ```

3. **Launch EC2 Instance in Private Subnet:**
   When launching an EC2 instance, specify the subnet ID of the private subnet created in the previous step.
   ```sh
   aws ec2 run-instances --image-id <ami-id> --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name <key-pair-name> --subnet-id <private-subnet-id>
   ```

4. **Ensure No Public IP Assignment:**
   Ensure that the instance does not get a public IP address by setting the `--associate-public-ip-address` flag to `false`.
   ```sh
   aws ec2 run-instances --image-id <ami-id> --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name <key-pair-name> --subnet-id <private-subnet-id> --associate-public-ip-address false
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your EC2 instance is launched in a private subnet, preventing it from being in a public subnet.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent an EC2 instance from being launched in a public subnet using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here are the steps to achieve this:

### 1. Install Boto3
First, ensure you have Boto3 installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

### 2. Identify Public Subnets
Identify the public subnets in your VPC. Public subnets typically have a route to an Internet Gateway. You can use Boto3 to list subnets and their route tables.

### 3. Create a Function to Check Subnet Type
Create a function to check if a subnet is public or private.

### 4. Launch EC2 Instance in a Private Subnet
Use the function to ensure that your EC2 instance is launched in a private subnet.

Here is a Python script to achieve this:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize a session using Amazon EC2
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

def is_public_subnet(subnet_id):
    # Describe the subnet
    subnet = ec2.describe_subnets(SubnetIds=[subnet_id])['Subnets'][0]
    
    # Get the route table associated with the subnet
    route_tables = ec2.describe_route_tables(
        Filters=[{'Name': 'association.subnet-id', 'Values': [subnet_id]}]
    )['RouteTables']
    
    for route_table in route_tables:
        for route in route_table['Routes']:
            if 'GatewayId' in route and route['GatewayId'].startswith('igw-'):
                return True
    return False

def launch_instance(subnet_id, image_id, instance_type):
    if is_public_subnet(subnet_id):
        raise ValueError("Cannot launch instance in a public subnet")
    
    # Launch the instance in a private subnet
    instance = ec2.run_instances(
        ImageId=image_id,
        InstanceType=instance_type,
        SubnetId=subnet_id,
        MinCount=1,
        MaxCount=1
    )
    return instance

# Example usage
private_subnet_id = 'subnet-0bb1c79de3EXAMPLE'  # Replace with your private subnet ID
image_id = 'ami-0abcdef1234567890'  # Replace with your AMI ID
instance_type = 't2.micro'  # Replace with your instance type

try:
    instance = launch_instance(private_subnet_id, image_id, instance_type)
    print("Instance launched successfully:", instance)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Install Boto3**: Ensure Boto3 is installed to interact with AWS services.
2. **Identify Public Subnets**: The `is_public_subnet` function checks if a subnet is public by examining its route table for an Internet Gateway.
3. **Create a Function to Check Subnet Type**: The function `is_public_subnet` returns `True` if the subnet is public, otherwise `False`.
4. **Launch EC2 Instance in a Private Subnet**: The `launch_instance` function raises an error if the subnet is public, ensuring that instances are only launched in private subnets.

This script ensures that EC2 instances are not launched in public subnets, thereby preventing potential security risks associated with public exposure.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under the "NETWORK & SECURITY" section, click on "Subnets". This will display a list of all the subnets in your AWS environment.
3. Click on the subnet ID that you want to check. This will open the details page for that subnet.
4. In the details page, look for the "Auto-assign public IPv4 address" setting. If this setting is enabled, it means that any EC2 instance launched in this subnet will automatically be assigned a public IP address, indicating that the EC2 instance is in a public subnet.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Once you have AWS CLI installed and configured, you can start using it to interact with your AWS services.

2. To check if an EC2 instance is in a public subnet, you first need to list all the instances in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with information about all your EC2 instances.

3. Next, you need to identify the subnet of each instance. You can do this by parsing the JSON output from the previous command. Look for the "SubnetId" field in the output. This field contains the ID of the subnet that the instance is in.

4. Once you have the subnet ID, you can check if it's a public subnet by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-subnets --subnet-ids <subnet-id>
   ```
   Replace `<subnet-id>` with the ID of the subnet you want to check. This command will return a JSON output with information about the subnet. Look for the "MapPublicIpOnLaunch" field in the output. If this field is set to "true", then the subnet is a public subnet. If it's set to "false", then the subnet is a private subnet.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3, AWS EC2, and more. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```
After installation, you need to configure it. You can do this in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```
This will prompt you for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, AWS Region. These are used to make programmatic calls to AWS from your machine.

2. Use Boto3 to interact with AWS EC2: You can use Boto3 to create, configure, and manage AWS services using Python script. Here is a simple script to list all EC2 instances in a specific region:

```python
import boto3

def list_instances(region):
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2', region_name=region)
    for instance in ec2.instances.all():
        print(instance.id, instance.state)

list_instances('us-west-1')
```

3. Check if EC2 instance is in a public subnet: You can check if an EC2 instance is in a public subnet by checking the 'PublicIpAddress' attribute of the instance. If this attribute is not None, then the instance is in a public subnet.

```python
import boto3

def check_public_subnet(region):
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2', region_name=region)
    for instance in ec2.instances.all():
        if instance.public_ip_address is not None:
            print(f"Instance {instance.id} is in a public subnet")

check_public_subnet('us-west-1')
```

4. Check if EC2 instance has a public IP address: You can also check if an EC2 instance has a public IP address by checking the 'PublicIpAddress' attribute of the instance. If this attribute is not None, then the instance has a public IP address.

```python
import boto3

def check_public_ip(region):
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2', region_name=region)
    for instance in ec2.instances.all():
        if instance.public_ip_address is not None:
            print(f"Instance {instance.id} has a public IP address")

check_public_ip('us-west-1')
```

These scripts will help you detect if an EC2 instance is in a public subnet or has a public IP address.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the EC2 instance in a public subnet in AWS, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the VPC dashboard.

2. Select the VPC containing the public subnet that the EC2 instance is in.

3. Select the Subnets tab and then select the public subnet that the EC2 instance is in.

4. Select the Route Table tab and then select the route table associated with the public subnet.

5. Remove the route that allows traffic to the internet gateway. This will prevent any traffic from the internet from reaching the EC2 instance.

6. Create a new route table and associate it with the public subnet.

7. Add a route to the new route table that allows traffic to reach the internet gateway. This will allow any traffic from the EC2 instance to reach the internet.

8. Launch a new EC2 instance in a private subnet and associate it with the new route table. This will ensure that the EC2 instance is not accessible from the internet.

9. Terminate the old EC2 instance in the public subnet.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having an EC2 instance in a public subnet in AWS.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of having an EC2 instance in a public subnet in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the public subnet in which the EC2 instance is running. You can do this by checking the subnet's route table and confirming that it has a route to an Internet Gateway.

2. Create a new private subnet in the same VPC as the public subnet. This new subnet should have a non-overlapping CIDR block and should not have a route to an Internet Gateway.

3. Stop the EC2 instance that is running in the public subnet.

4. Modify the instance's network interface to move it from the public subnet to the new private subnet. You can do this using the following command:

```
aws ec2 modify-network-interface-attribute --network-interface-id <network-interface-id> --subnet-id <new-private-subnet-id>
```

Replace `<network-interface-id>` with the ID of the network interface attached to the EC2 instance, and `<new-private-subnet-id>` with the ID of the new private subnet you created.

5. Start the EC2 instance.

6. Verify that the EC2 instance now has a private IP address in the new private subnet and does not have a public IP address. You can do this by checking the instance's network interface settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of an EC2 instance in a public subnet in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to identify the EC2 instances that are in the public subnet. You can do this by using the `describe_instances` method of the `boto3` library in Python.

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.describe_instances(
    Filters=[
        {
            'Name': 'subnet-id',
            'Values': [
                'subnet-0123456789abcdef0',
            ]
        },
    ]
)

for reservation in response['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        print(instance['InstanceId'])
```

Replace the `subnet-id` with the ID of the public subnet.

2. Once you have identified the instances, you need to move them to a private subnet. To do this, you can modify the network interface of the instance and attach it to a private subnet. You can use the `modify_network_interface_attribute` method of the `boto3` library to do this.

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.modify_network_interface_attribute(
    NetworkInterfaceId='eni-0123456789abcdef0',
    Groups=[
        'sg-0123456789abcdef0',
    ],
    Description={
        'Value': 'Modified description'
    }
)

print(response)
```

Replace the `NetworkInterfaceId` with the ID of the network interface of the instance that you want to modify. Also, replace the `sg-0123456789abcdef0` with the ID of the security group that you want to attach to the network interface.

3. After modifying the network interface, you need to verify that the instance is now in the private subnet. You can do this by checking the `SubnetId` attribute of the instance using the `describe_instances` method.

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.describe_instances(
    InstanceIds=[
        'i-0123456789abcdef0',
    ],
)

for reservation in response['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        print(instance['SubnetId'])
```

Replace the `i-0123456789abcdef0` with the ID of the instance that you want to check.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of an EC2 instance in a public subnet in AWS using Python.
