### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under the "NETWORK & SECURITY" section, click on "Subnets". This will display a list of all the subnets in your AWS environment.
3. Click on the subnet ID that you want to check. This will open the details page for that subnet.
4. In the details page, look for the "Auto-assign public IPv4 address" setting. If this setting is enabled, it means that any new instances launched in this subnet will automatically be assigned a public IP address, indicating that the EC2 instance is in a public subnet.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the subnets in your VPC using the following command:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-subnets
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details about all the subnets in your VPC.

3. To identify if a subnet is public or private, you need to check the route tables associated with the subnet. You can do this using the following command:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-route-tables --filters Name=association.subnet-id,Values=<subnet-id>
   ```
   Replace `<subnet-id>` with the ID of the subnet you want to check. This command will return a JSON output with details about the route tables associated with the subnet.

4. In the output of the above command, look for the `Routes` section. If there is a route with `DestinationCidrBlock` set to `0.0.0.0/0` and `GatewayId` starting with `igw-`, then the subnet is a public subnet. If there is no such route, then the subnet is a private subnet.

5. Now, to check if any EC2 instances are in the public subnet, you can use the following command:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --filters Name=subnet-id,Values=<subnet-id>
   ```
   Replace `<subnet-id>` with the ID of the public subnet. This command will return a JSON output with details about all the EC2 instances in the subnet. If there are any instances in the output, then those instances are in the public subnet.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3, AWS EC2, and more. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```
After installation, you need to configure it. You can do this in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```
This will prompt you for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, AWS Region, and output format. 

2. Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS:

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError

# Establish a session
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Create a function to check if an EC2 instance is in a public subnet:

```python
def check_public_subnet():
    ec2_resource = session.resource('ec2')
    for instance in ec2_resource.instances.all():
        for interface in instance.network_interfaces:
            subnet = ec2_resource.Subnet(interface.subnet_id)
            if subnet.map_public_ip_on_launch:
                print(f"Instance {instance.id} is in a public subnet.")
```

4. Call the function to check all instances:

```python
check_public_subnet()
```

This script will print out the IDs of all instances that are in a public subnet. If no instances are in a public subnet, it will not print anything.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the EC2 instance in a public subnet in AWS, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the VPC dashboard.

2. Select the VPC containing the public subnet that the EC2 instance is in.

3. Select the Subnets tab and then select the public subnet that the EC2 instance is in.

4. Select the Route Table tab and then select the route table associated with the public subnet.

5. Remove the route that allows traffic to the internet gateway. This will prevent any traffic from the internet from reaching the EC2 instance.

6. Create a new route table and associate it with the public subnet.

7. Add a route to the new route table that allows traffic to reach the internet gateway. This will allow any traffic from the EC2 instance to reach the internet.

8. Launch a new EC2 instance in a private subnet and associate it with the new route table. This will ensure that the EC2 instance is not accessible from the internet.

9. Terminate the old EC2 instance in the public subnet.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having an EC2 instance in a public subnet in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of having an EC2 instance in a public subnet in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the public subnet in which the EC2 instance is running. You can do this by checking the subnet's route table and confirming that it has a route to an Internet Gateway.

2. Create a new private subnet in the same VPC as the public subnet. This new subnet should have a non-overlapping CIDR block and should not have a route to an Internet Gateway.

3. Stop the EC2 instance that is running in the public subnet.

4. Modify the instance's network interface to move it from the public subnet to the new private subnet. You can do this using the following command:

```
aws ec2 modify-network-interface-attribute --network-interface-id <network-interface-id> --subnet-id <new-private-subnet-id>
```

Replace `<network-interface-id>` with the ID of the network interface attached to the EC2 instance, and `<new-private-subnet-id>` with the ID of the new private subnet you created.

5. Start the EC2 instance.

6. Verify that the EC2 instance now has a private IP address in the new private subnet and does not have a public IP address. You can do this by checking the instance's network interface settings.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of an EC2 instance in a public subnet in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to identify the EC2 instances that are in the public subnet. You can do this by using the `describe_instances` method of the `boto3` library in Python.

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.describe_instances(
    Filters=[
        {
            'Name': 'subnet-id',
            'Values': [
                'subnet-0123456789abcdef0',
            ]
        },
    ]
)

for reservation in response['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        print(instance['InstanceId'])
```

Replace the `subnet-id` with the ID of the public subnet.

2. Once you have identified the instances, you need to move them to a private subnet. To do this, you can modify the network interface of the instance and attach it to a private subnet. You can use the `modify_network_interface_attribute` method of the `boto3` library to do this.

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.modify_network_interface_attribute(
    NetworkInterfaceId='eni-0123456789abcdef0',
    Groups=[
        'sg-0123456789abcdef0',
    ],
    Description={
        'Value': 'Modified description'
    }
)

print(response)
```

Replace the `NetworkInterfaceId` with the ID of the network interface of the instance that you want to modify. Also, replace the `sg-0123456789abcdef0` with the ID of the security group that you want to attach to the network interface.

3. After modifying the network interface, you need to verify that the instance is now in the private subnet. You can do this by checking the `SubnetId` attribute of the instance using the `describe_instances` method.

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.describe_instances(
    InstanceIds=[
        'i-0123456789abcdef0',
    ],
)

for reservation in response['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        print(instance['SubnetId'])
```

Replace the `i-0123456789abcdef0` with the ID of the instance that you want to check.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of an EC2 instance in a public subnet in AWS using Python.
