### Remediation

How to remediate if reserved instances are expiring after 7 days?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the expiring reserved instances:
   - Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
   - From the left navigation pane, click on "Reserved Instances" under the "Instances" section.
   - In the Reserved Instances dashboard, review the list of reserved instances and identify the ones that are expiring within the next 7 days.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Reserved Instance Lease Expiration In The Next 7 Days" Policy.)
2. Determine the appropriate action:
   - Evaluate your workload and usage patterns to determine if you still require the instances covered by the expiring reserved instances.
   - If the instances are no longer needed or if you have alternative cost-saving strategies in place, you may choose not to renew the reserved instances.
3. Renew or modify the reserved instances (optional):
   - If you decide to keep the reserved instances, you can renew them to extend their term.
   - Select the expiring reserved instances from the Reserved Instances dashboard.
   - Click on the "Actions" button and choose "Renew" or "Modify" to adjust the term or other attributes of the reserved instances.
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the renewal or modification process.
   - Keep in mind that renewing or modifying reserved instances may incur additional costs or require updated payment information.
4. Consider alternative cost-saving options:
   - If you don't want to renew or modify the expiring reserved instances, consider alternative cost-saving options, such as:
     - Convert the instances to On-Demand or Spot instances based on your workload requirements.
     - Explore other reserved instance offerings that better align with your current usage patterns.
     - Utilize savings plans or other pricing models that offer flexibility and cost savings.
     - Optimize your overall EC2 usage by rightsizing instances or leveraging auto scaling to match demand.
