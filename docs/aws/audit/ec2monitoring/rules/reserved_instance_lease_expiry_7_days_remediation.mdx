<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The Reserved Instance Lease Expiration In The Next 7 Days issue in AWS can be remediated by modifying the reservation period of the instance. Here are the steps to remediate this issue using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to get a list of all the reserved instances that have an expiration date within the next 7 days:

```
aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --filters "Name=state,Values=active" "Name=product-description,Values=*Linux/UNIX*" "Name=scope,Values=Availability Zone" --query 'ReservedInstances[*].[ReservedInstancesId,InstanceType,AvailabilityZone,InstanceCount,Start,End,Duration,State,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value|[0]]' --output table --region <region>
```

Note: Replace `<region>` with the region where your instances are located.

3. Identify the instance that requires remediation.

4. Run the following command to modify the reservation period:

```
aws ec2 modify-reserved-instances --reserved-instances-id <reservation_id> --target-configuration "InstanceCount=<count>,End=`date -d '+1 year' +%Y-%m-%d`" --region <region>
```

Note: Replace `<reservation_id>` with the ID of the reserved instance that requires remediation and `<count>` with the number of instances that you want to reserve. Also, ensure that the `End` date is set to at least 1 year from the current date.

5. Verify that the reservation has been modified by running the first command again and checking that the expiration date is now more than 7 days away.

By following these steps, you can remediate the Reserved Instance Lease Expiration In The Next 7 Days issue in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of Reserved Instance Lease Expiration in the next 7 days in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK boto3:

```
import boto3
```

2. Create an EC2 client object:

```
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Use the describe_reserved_instances() method to get the list of all reserved instances:

```
reserved_instances = ec2.describe_reserved_instances()
```

4. Loop through the list of reserved instances and check if any of them are expiring within the next 7 days:

```
for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedInstances']:
    expiration_time = reserved_instance['End']
    remaining_days = (expiration_time.date() - datetime.date.today()).days
    if remaining_days <= 7:
        # Do something to remediate the issue
```

5. To remediate the issue, you can either renew the reserved instance or purchase a new one. To renew the reserved instance, use the modify_reserved_instances() method:

```
response = ec2.modify_reserved_instances(
    ReservedInstancesIds=[
        'string',
    ],
    TargetConfigurations=[
        {
            'AvailabilityZone': 'string',
            'InstanceCount': 123,
            'InstanceType': 'string',
            'Platform': 'string',
            'Scope': 'string'
        },
    ]
)
```

6. Alternatively, you can purchase a new reserved instance using the purchase_reserved_instances_offering() method:

```
response = ec2.purchase_reserved_instances_offering(
    InstanceCount=123,
    ReservedInstancesOfferingId='string',
    DryRun=True|False,
    LimitPrice={
        'Amount': 'string',
        'CurrencyCode': 'string'
    }
)
```

7. Finally, you can schedule a Lambda function to run this script periodically and remediate the issue automatically.
