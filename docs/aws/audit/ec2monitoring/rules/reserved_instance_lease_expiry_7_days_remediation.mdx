<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent Reserved Instance Lease Expiration in the next 7 days in EC2 using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Monitor Reserved Instances:**
   - Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
   - In the left-hand menu, click on **Reserved Instances**.
   - Review the list of Reserved Instances and their expiration dates. Pay special attention to those expiring within the next 7 days.

2. **Set Up Billing and Cost Management Alerts:**
   - Go to the **Billing and Cost Management Dashboard**.
   - Click on **Budgets** in the left-hand menu.
   - Create a new budget and set up alerts for when your Reserved Instance usage is nearing its limit or when expiration is approaching.

3. **Enable AWS Config Rules:**
   - Navigate to the **AWS Config** service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click on **Rules** in the left-hand menu.
   - Add a new rule and select **ec2-reserved-instance-expiration-check**. This rule will continuously monitor your Reserved Instances and notify you of any that are expiring soon.

4. **Automate Notifications with CloudWatch:**
   - Go to the **CloudWatch** service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click on **Rules** under the Events section.
   - Create a new rule with an event pattern that matches Reserved Instance expiration events.
   - Set up a target for this rule, such as an SNS topic, to send notifications to your email or other communication channels when a Reserved Instance is about to expire.

By following these steps, you can proactively monitor and receive notifications about your Reserved Instances, helping you to take timely action before they expire.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent Reserved Instance Lease Expiration in the next 7 days in EC2 using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **List Reserved Instances:**
   First, identify the Reserved Instances that are about to expire. Use the following command to list all your Reserved Instances and their expiration dates:
   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --query "ReservedInstances[*].{ID:ReservedInstancesId,End:End}"
   ```

2. **Filter Expiring Instances:**
   Filter the Reserved Instances that are expiring within the next 7 days. You can use the `--filters` option to narrow down the results. Note that AWS CLI does not directly support date arithmetic, so you may need to handle this logic in a script or manually:
   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --filters "Name=end,Values=$(date -d '+7 days' --utc +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --query "ReservedInstances[*].{ID:ReservedInstancesId,End:End}"
   ```

3. **Purchase New Reserved Instances:**
   Once you have identified the expiring Reserved Instances, you can purchase new ones to replace them. Use the following command to purchase a new Reserved Instance:
   ```sh
   aws ec2 purchase-reserved-instances-offering --instance-count <count> --reserved-instances-offering-id <offering-id>
   ```
   Replace `<count>` with the number of instances you need and `<offering-id>` with the ID of the Reserved Instance offering you want to purchase.

4. **Automate Monitoring and Notification:**
   Set up a CloudWatch alarm or a scheduled Lambda function to monitor Reserved Instance expiration and notify you in advance. This step involves creating a CloudWatch alarm and a Lambda function, which can be done using the AWS CLI:
   ```sh
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name "ReservedInstanceExpirationAlarm" --metric-name "ReservedInstanceExpiration" --namespace "AWS/EC2" --statistic "Maximum" --period 86400 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold" --evaluation-periods 1 --alarm-actions <sns-topic-arn>
   ```

By following these steps, you can proactively manage and prevent Reserved Instance lease expiration in AWS EC2 using the AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent Reserved Instance Lease Expiration in the next 7 days in Amazon EC2 using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   - Ensure you have Boto3 installed and configured with the necessary AWS credentials.

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script to Monitor Reserved Instances:**
   - Write a script to check the expiration dates of your Reserved Instances.

   ```python
   import boto3
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Initialize a session using Amazon EC2
   ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

   # Get the current date and the date 7 days from now
   current_date = datetime.utcnow()
   warning_date = current_date + timedelta(days=7)

   # Describe reserved instances
   response = ec2_client.describe_reserved_instances()

   # Check for instances expiring in the next 7 days
   for reserved_instance in response['ReservedInstances']:
       end_date = reserved_instance['End']
       if current_date <= end_date <= warning_date:
           print(f"Reserved Instance {reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']} is expiring on {end_date}")
   ```

3. **Set Up Notifications:**
   - Integrate with AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) to send alerts if any Reserved Instances are expiring soon.

   ```python
   import boto3

   sns_client = boto3.client('sns')
   topic_arn = 'arn:aws:sns:your-region:your-account-id:your-topic'

   def send_notification(message):
       sns_client.publish(
           TopicArn=topic_arn,
           Message=message,
           Subject='Reserved Instance Expiration Alert'
       )

   # Modify the previous script to send notifications
   for reserved_instance in response['ReservedInstances']:
       end_date = reserved_instance['End']
       if current_date <= end_date <= warning_date:
           message = f"Reserved Instance {reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']} is expiring on {end_date}"
           print(message)
           send_notification(message)
   ```

4. **Automate the Script Execution:**
   - Use AWS Lambda or a cron job to run the script periodically (e.g., daily) to ensure continuous monitoring.

   Example of setting up a cron job (Linux):

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

   Add the following line to run the script daily at midnight:

   ```bash
   0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively monitor and prevent Reserved Instance Lease Expiration in the next 7 days using Python scripts.

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Reserved Instances". This will open a list of all your reserved instances.

3. In the list of reserved instances, look for the "End date" column. This column shows the expiration date of each reserved instance.

4. Manually check if any of the instances are set to expire in the next 7 days.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the EC2 instances.

2. Once the AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can use the following command to list all your reserved instances:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --filters Name=state,Values=active
   ```

3. The output of this command will be a JSON object that contains information about all your reserved instances. You need to look for the "End" field in the "ReservedInstances" section. This field contains the expiration date of the reserved instance.

4. To find the instances that will expire in the next 7 days, you can use a Python script to parse the output and filter the instances. Here is a simple script that does this:

   ```python
   import json
   import subprocess
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Run the AWS CLI command and get the output
   output = subprocess.check_output(["aws", "ec2", "describe-reserved-instances", "--filters", "Name=state,Values=active"])
   data = json.loads(output)

   # Get the current date
   now = datetime.now()

   # Loop through the instances and check the expiration date
   for instance in data["ReservedInstances"]:
       end_date = datetime.strptime(instance["End"], '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')
       if end_date < now + timedelta(days=7):
           print("Instance ID: ", instance["ReservedInstancesId"])
   ```

   This script will print the IDs of the instances that will expire in the next 7 days.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your local environment. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access EC2 instances.

```python
pip install boto3
aws configure
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and create a session using your AWS credentials.

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Use the `describe_reserved_instances` method from the EC2 client to get a list of all reserved instances. Then, iterate over the list and check if the `End` date of each instance is within the next 7 days.

```python
ec2 = session.client('ec2')

response = ec2.describe_reserved_instances()

for instance in response['ReservedInstances']:
    end_date = instance['End']
    if end_date <= datetime.now() + timedelta(days=7):
        print(f"Reserved instance {instance['ReservedInstancesId']} will expire in the next 7 days.")
```

4. This script will print out the IDs of all reserved instances that will expire in the next 7 days. You can modify the script to send notifications or take other actions as needed.

The Reserved Instance Lease Expiration In The Next 7 Days issue in AWS can be remediated by modifying the reservation period of the instance. Here are the steps to remediate this issue using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to get a list of all the reserved instances that have an expiration date within the next 7 days:

```
aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --filters "Name=state,Values=active" "Name=product-description,Values=*Linux/UNIX*" "Name=scope,Values=Availability Zone" --query 'ReservedInstances[*].[ReservedInstancesId,InstanceType,AvailabilityZone,InstanceCount,Start,End,Duration,State,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value|[0]]' --output table --region <region>
```

Note: Replace `<region>` with the region where your instances are located.

3. Identify the instance that requires remediation.

4. Run the following command to modify the reservation period:

```
aws ec2 modify-reserved-instances --reserved-instances-id <reservation_id> --target-configuration "InstanceCount=<count>,End=`date -d '+1 year' +%Y-%m-%d`" --region <region>
```

Note: Replace `<reservation_id>` with the ID of the reserved instance that requires remediation and `<count>` with the number of instances that you want to reserve. Also, ensure that the `End` date is set to at least 1 year from the current date.

5. Verify that the reservation has been modified by running the first command again and checking that the expiration date is now more than 7 days away.

2. Create an EC2 client object:

```
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Use the describe_reserved_instances() method to get the list of all reserved instances:

```
reserved_instances = ec2.describe_reserved_instances()
```

4. Loop through the list of reserved instances and check if any of them are expiring within the next 7 days:

```
for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedInstances']:
    expiration_time = reserved_instance['End']
    remaining_days = (expiration_time.date() - datetime.date.today()).days
    if remaining_days <= 7:
        # Do something to remediate the issue
```

5. To remediate the issue, you can either renew the reserved instance or purchase a new one. To renew the reserved instance, use the modify_reserved_instances() method:

```
response = ec2.modify_reserved_instances(
