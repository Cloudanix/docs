1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Reserved Instances". This will open a list of all your reserved instances.

3. In the list of reserved instances, look for the "End date" column. This column shows the expiration date of each reserved instance.

4. Manually check if any of the instances are set to expire in the next 7 days.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the EC2 instances.

2. Once the AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can use the following command to list all your reserved instances:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --filters Name=state,Values=active
   ```

3. The output of this command will be a JSON object that contains information about all your reserved instances. You need to look for the "End" field in the "ReservedInstances" section. This field contains the expiration date of the reserved instance.

4. To find the instances that will expire in the next 7 days, you can use a Python script to parse the output and filter the instances. Here is a simple script that does this:

   ```python
   import json
   import subprocess
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Run the AWS CLI command and get the output
   output = subprocess.check_output(["aws", "ec2", "describe-reserved-instances", "--filters", "Name=state,Values=active"])
   data = json.loads(output)

   # Get the current date
   now = datetime.now()

   # Loop through the instances and check the expiration date
   for instance in data["ReservedInstances"]:
       end_date = datetime.strptime(instance["End"], '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')
       if end_date < now + timedelta(days=7):
           print("Instance ID: ", instance["ReservedInstancesId"])
   ```

   This script will print the IDs of the instances that will expire in the next 7 days.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your local environment. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access EC2 instances.

```python
pip install boto3
aws configure
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and create a session using your AWS credentials.

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Use the `describe_reserved_instances` method from the EC2 client to get a list of all reserved instances. Then, iterate over the list and check if the `End` date of each instance is within the next 7 days.

```python
ec2 = session.client('ec2')

response = ec2.describe_reserved_instances()

for instance in response['ReservedInstances']:
    end_date = instance['End']
    if end_date <= datetime.now() + timedelta(days=7):
        print(f"Reserved instance {instance['ReservedInstancesId']} will expire in the next 7 days.")
```

4. This script will print out the IDs of all reserved instances that will expire in the next 7 days. You can modify the script to send notifications or take other actions as needed.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The Reserved Instance Lease Expiration In The Next 7 Days issue in AWS can be remediated by modifying the reservation period of the instance. Here are the steps to remediate this issue using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to get a list of all the reserved instances that have an expiration date within the next 7 days:

```
aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --filters "Name=state,Values=active" "Name=product-description,Values=*Linux/UNIX*" "Name=scope,Values=Availability Zone" --query 'ReservedInstances[*].[ReservedInstancesId,InstanceType,AvailabilityZone,InstanceCount,Start,End,Duration,State,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value|[0]]' --output table --region <region>
```

Note: Replace `<region>` with the region where your instances are located.

3. Identify the instance that requires remediation.

4. Run the following command to modify the reservation period:

```
aws ec2 modify-reserved-instances --reserved-instances-id <reservation_id> --target-configuration "InstanceCount=<count>,End=`date -d '+1 year' +%Y-%m-%d`" --region <region>
```

Note: Replace `<reservation_id>` with the ID of the reserved instance that requires remediation and `<count>` with the number of instances that you want to reserve. Also, ensure that the `End` date is set to at least 1 year from the current date.

5. Verify that the reservation has been modified by running the first command again and checking that the expiration date is now more than 7 days away.

By following these steps, you can remediate the Reserved Instance Lease Expiration In The Next 7 Days issue in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of Reserved Instance Lease Expiration in the next 7 days in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK boto3:

```
import boto3
```

2. Create an EC2 client object:

```
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Use the describe_reserved_instances() method to get the list of all reserved instances:

```
reserved_instances = ec2.describe_reserved_instances()
```

4. Loop through the list of reserved instances and check if any of them are expiring within the next 7 days:

```
for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedInstances']:
    expiration_time = reserved_instance['End']
    remaining_days = (expiration_time.date() - datetime.date.today()).days
    if remaining_days <= 7:
        # Do something to remediate the issue
```

5. To remediate the issue, you can either renew the reserved instance or purchase a new one. To renew the reserved instance, use the modify_reserved_instances() method:

```
response = ec2.modify_reserved_instances(
    ReservedInstancesIds=[
        'string',
    ],
    TargetConfigurations=[
        {
            'AvailabilityZone': 'string',
            'InstanceCount': 123,
            'InstanceType': 'string',
            'Platform': 'string',
            'Scope': 'string'
        },
    ]
)
```

6. Alternatively, you can purchase a new reserved instance using the purchase_reserved_instances_offering() method:

```
response = ec2.purchase_reserved_instances_offering(
    InstanceCount=123,
    ReservedInstancesOfferingId='string',
    DryRun=True|False,
    LimitPrice={
        'Amount': 'string',
        'CurrencyCode': 'string'
    }
)
```

7. Finally, you can schedule a Lambda function to run this script periodically and remediate the issue automatically.
