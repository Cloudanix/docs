1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "Elastic Block Store", click on "Snapshots". This will display a list of all snapshots available in your AWS account.
3. For each snapshot, check the "Tags" column. If a snapshot does not have a tag with the key "Backup", then it means that the Elastic File System (EFS) associated with that snapshot does not have a backup plan.
4. To confirm, you can click on the snapshot ID to view its details. In the "Description" field, if it says "This snapshot was created by AWS Backup", then it means that the EFS has a backup plan. If not, then it confirms that the EFS does not have a backup plan.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local system. You can do this by downloading the appropriate installer from the AWS CLI website. Once installed, you can configure it by running `aws configure` and providing your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all EFS file systems: Use the following command to list all the EFS file systems in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws efs describe-file-systems --query 'FileSystems[*].[FileSystemId]' --output text
   ```

   This command will return a list of all EFS file system IDs.

3. Check backup plans: For each EFS file system ID returned by the previous command, you need to check if there is a backup plan associated with it. You can do this by using the following command:

   ```
   aws backup describe-backup-jobs --by-resource-arn arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:<region>:<account-id>:file-system/<file-system-id> --query 'BackupJobs[*].[BackupJobId]' --output text
   ```

   Replace `<region>`, `<account-id>`, and `<file-system-id>` with your AWS region, account ID, and the EFS file system ID respectively. This command will return a list of backup job IDs if there is a backup plan associated with the EFS file system.

4. Analyze the results: If the previous command returns a list of backup job IDs, it means that the EFS file system has a backup plan. If it returns nothing, it means that the EFS file system does not have a backup plan. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each EFS file system ID to check all your EFS file systems.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You will need the 'boto3' library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Set up AWS credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. You can pass these credentials into your Python script directly (not recommended for security reasons), or more securely, you can set up your credentials file at ~/.aws/credentials. 

3. Write a Python script to check for EFS backup plans: You can use the 'describe_backup_policy' method provided by the EFS client in boto3. This method returns the backup policy for the specified EFS file system.

```python
import boto3

def check_efs_backup_policy(file_system_id):
    efs = boto3.client('efs')
    response = efs.describe_backup_policy(
        FileSystemId=file_system_id
    )
    return response['BackupPolicy']

file_system_id = 'your-efs-file-system-id'
backup_policy = check_efs_backup_policy(file_system_id)
print(backup_policy)
```

4. Analyze the output: The script will return the backup policy for the specified EFS file system. If the 'Status' field in the output is 'ENABLED', it means that the EFS file system has a backup plan. If it's 'DISABLED', it means that the EFS file system does not have a backup plan.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of not having a backup plan for Elastic File System (EFS) in AWS EC2 using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Backup Plan**:
   - Use the AWS CLI command `create-backup-plan` to create a backup plan for your EFS file system.
   - Specify the backup plan details such as name, schedule, retention policy, and backup vault.
   - Example command:
     ```
     aws backup create-backup-plan --backup-plan "Name=MyBackupPlan,BackupPlanRule={RuleName=DailyBackup,ScheduleExpression=\"cron(0 0 * * ? *)\",TargetBackupVaultName=MyBackupVault,StartWindowMinutes=60,CompletionWindowMinutes=120,Lifecycle={MoveToColdStorageAfterDays=30,DeleteAfterDays=90}}"
     ```

2. **Assign Backup Plan to EFS File System**:
   - Use the AWS CLI command `put-backup-vault-access-policy` to assign the created backup plan to your EFS file system.
   - Specify the EFS file system ID and the ARN of the backup plan.
   - Example command:
     ```
     aws backup put-backup-vault-access-policy --backup-vault-name MyBackupVault --policy "{\"BackupPlanId\":\"arn:aws:backup:us-west-2:123456789012:backup-plan:MyBackupPlan\"}"
     ```

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of not having a backup plan for Elastic File System (EFS) in AWS EC2 using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Boto3**: Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python. You can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create a Backup Plan**: You can create a backup plan using AWS Backup service. Here's an example Python script to create a backup plan for your EFS:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize the AWS Backup client
   backup_client = boto3.client('backup')

   # Define the resource ARN for your EFS file system
   resource_arn = 'arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:us-east-1:123456789012:file-system/fs-12345678'

   # Define the backup plan name and backup rule
   backup_plan_name = 'EFS-Backup-Plan'
   backup_rule = {
       'RuleName': 'EFS-Backup-Rule',
       'TargetBackupVaultName': 'MyBackupVault',
       'ScheduleExpression': 'cron(0 12 * * ? *)',  # Daily backup at 12:00 PM UTC
       'StartWindowMinutes': 60,
       'CompletionWindowMinutes': 60
   }

   # Create a backup plan
   response = backup_client.create_backup_plan(
       BackupPlan = {
           'BackupPlanName': backup_plan_name,
           'BackupPlanRule': backup_rule
       }
   )

   print('Backup plan created successfully!')
   ```

   Make sure to replace the `resource_arn` with the ARN of your EFS file system and customize the backup plan name, rule, and schedule as needed.

3. **Run the Python Script**: Save the above Python script in a file (e.g., `create_backup_plan.py`) and run it using Python:
   ```bash
   python create_backup_plan.py
   ```

4. **Verify Backup Plan**: You can verify the backup plan by checking the AWS Backup console or by listing the backup plans using the AWS CLI:
   ```bash
   aws backup list-backup-plans
   ```

By following these steps, you can create a backup plan for your EFS file system in AWS EC2 using Python and ensure that you have a backup strategy in place for your data.
