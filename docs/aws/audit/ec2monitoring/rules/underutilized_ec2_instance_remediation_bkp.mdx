### Remediation

How to remediate underutilized EC2 instances?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify Underutilized EC2 Instances:
   - Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
   - From the left navigation pane, click on "Instances" under the "Instances" section.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "EC2 Instances Should Not Be Underutilized" Policy.)
   - Review the list of existing EC2 instances and identify instances that consistently exhibit low CPU or network utilization.
2. Analyze the Utilization:
   - Select the underutilized EC2 instance.
   - Click on the "Monitoring" tab to view the CPU and network utilization graphs over time.
   - Confirm that the instance is indeed underutilized and not just experiencing temporary low utilization.
3. Implement Remediation Measures:
   - Option 1: Right-sizing:
     - Review the instance type and determine if it is appropriate for the workload.
     - If the instance has excess resources, consider downsizing to a smaller instance type to better match the workload's requirements.
     - Stop the instance if it's EBS-backed, modify the instance type, and then start the instance again.
   - Option 2: Consolidation:
     - Identify multiple underutilized instances that serve similar purposes and consolidate them into a single instance or fewer instances.
     - Migrate the workloads from the underutilized instances to a more efficient configuration.
   - Option 3: Utilize Auto Scaling:
     - If the underutilization is intermittent or fluctuates, consider implementing Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand.
     - Configure scaling policies to add or remove instances based on predefined utilization thresholds.
4. Monitor and Validate:
   - After implementing the remediation measures, monitor the performance and utilization of the EC2 instances to ensure that the underutilization is effectively addressed.
   - Regularly review monitoring metrics, logs, and performance tests to validate the impact of the remediation measures on resource utilization and cost optimization.
