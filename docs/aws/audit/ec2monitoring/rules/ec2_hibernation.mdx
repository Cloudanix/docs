1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "Instances", click on "Instances".
3. In the Instances dashboard, select the EC2 instance that you want to verify.
4. In the bottom panel, under the "Description" tab, look for the "Root device type" field. If the value is "ebs", the instance is EBS-backed. Hibernation is only available for EBS-backed instances.
5. Next, check the instance type. Not all instance types support hibernation. You can find the instance type in the "Instance type" field in the "Description" tab.
6. Finally, check if the instance is enabled for hibernation. This can be done by looking at the "Hibernation" field in the "Description" tab. If the value is "enabled", then hibernation is enabled for the instance. If the value is "disabled", then hibernation is not enabled for the instance.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all EC2 instances: Once AWS CLI is set up, you can list all your EC2 instances by running the following command:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with the details of all your EC2 instances.

3. Check Hibernation Configuration: Unfortunately, AWS CLI does not provide a direct command to check if hibernation is enabled for an EC2 instance. However, you can check if an instance is hibernation-compatible by looking at the instance type. Hibernation is only supported for instances that are EBS-backed and are of the instance types that support hibernation. You can check the instance type in the JSON output from the previous step.

4. Python Script: If you want to automate this process, you can write a Python script using the boto3 library to list all EC2 instances and check their hibernation compatibility. Here is a simple script to do this:

   ```
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

   for instance in ec2.instances.all():
       if instance.instance_type in ['m3.medium', 'm3.large', 'm3.xlarge', 'm3.2xlarge']:
           print(f"Instance {instance.id} is hibernation-compatible")
       else:
           print(f"Instance {instance.id} is not hibernation-compatible")
   ```
   Replace the list of instance types with the list of instance types that support hibernation. This script will print whether each instance is hibernation-compatible or not.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install Boto3 in your Python environment. You can do this using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing Boto3, you need to configure it with your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules and create an EC2 resource object:
   You need to import the Boto3 module in your Python script and create an EC2 resource object. This object will allow you to interact with your EC2 instances.
   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
   ```

3. Iterate over all EC2 instances and check the hibernation option:
   You can use the `instances.all()` method to get a list of all your EC2 instances. Then, you can iterate over this list and check the `hibernation_options` attribute of each instance. If the `configured` key of this attribute is False, then hibernation is not enabled for that instance.
   ```python
   for instance in ec2.instances.all():
       hibernation_options = instance.hibernation_options
       if not hibernation_options['configured']:
           print(f'Hibernation is not enabled for instance {instance.id}')
   ```

4. Handle exceptions:
   It's a good practice to handle exceptions in your script. For example, you might want to catch the `NoCredentialsError` exception, which is raised when Boto3 can't find your AWS credentials.
   ```python
   try:
       for instance in ec2.instances.all():
           hibernation_options = instance.hibernation_options
           if not hibernation_options['configured']:
               print(f'Hibernation is not enabled for instance {instance.id}')
   except boto3.exceptions.NoCredentialsError:
       print('AWS credentials not found')
   ```
   This script will print the IDs of all EC2 instances for which hibernation is not enabled.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the AWS EC2 hibernation misconfiguration using the AWS console:

1. Login to your AWS console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.

2. Select the EC2 instance for which you want to enable hibernation.

3. Click on the 'Actions' button and select 'Instance Settings' from the dropdown.

4. Click on the 'Enable Hibernation' option.

5. A pop-up window will appear, click on 'Enable' to confirm the action.

6. Once hibernation is enabled, you need to stop and start the instance to apply the changes. Click on the 'Actions' button and select 'Instance State' from the dropdown.

7. Click on 'Stop' to stop the instance.

8. Once the instance is stopped, click on 'Start' to start the instance again.

9. After the instance is started, hibernation will be enabled.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the AWS EC2 hibernation misconfiguration using the AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of AWS EC2 Hibernation not being enabled, follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine and run the following command to enable hibernation for all instances in the region:
```
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --hibernation-options Configured=true
```
Note: Replace `<instance-id>` with the actual instance ID of the instance for which you want to enable hibernation.

2. Once you have enabled hibernation for all instances in the region, you can verify the same by running the following command:
```
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id> --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].HibernationOptions'
```
Note: Replace `<instance-id>` with the actual instance ID of the instance for which you enabled hibernation.

3. If the output of the above command shows that hibernation is enabled, then you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration. If not, then you can try enabling hibernation again using the first command.

4. Repeat the above steps for all instances in the region to ensure that hibernation is enabled for all instances.

Note: Enabling hibernation may require stopping and starting the instance. Make sure to plan accordingly and schedule any necessary downtime.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration in AWS EC2 Hibernation should be enabled, you can follow the below steps using Python:

1. First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using the following command:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Next, you need to create a Boto3 client for EC2 using the following code:

   ```
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
   ```

3. Then, you can use the describe_instances() method to get a list of all instances in your AWS account:

   ```
   instances = ec2.describe_instances()
   ```

4. Next, you can loop through each instance and check if hibernation is enabled using the describe_instance_attribute() method:

   ```
   for instance in instances['Reservations']:
       instance_id = instance['Instances'][0]['InstanceId']
       hibernation_enabled = ec2.describe_instance_attribute(InstanceId=instance_id, Attribute='hibernation')['Hibernation']['Value']
   ```

5. If hibernation is not enabled, you can use the modify_instance_attribute() method to enable it:

   ```
   if not hibernation_enabled:
       ec2.modify_instance_attribute(InstanceId=instance_id, HibernationOptions={'Configured': True})
   ```

6. Finally, you can print a message indicating that hibernation has been enabled:

   ```
   print(f'Hibernation has been enabled for instance {instance_id}')
   ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration in AWS EC2 Hibernation should be enabled using Python.
