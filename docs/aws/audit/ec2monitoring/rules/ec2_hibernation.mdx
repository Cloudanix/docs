How to enable hibernation for EC2 instances?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
2. From the left navigation pane, click on "Instances" to view the list of your EC2 instances.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "AWS EC2 Hibernation Should Be Enabled" Policy.)
3. Select the EC2 instance for which you want to enable hibernation.
4. Click on the "Actions" button at the top and choose "Instance Settings" from the dropdown menu.
5. In the sub-menu that appears, click on "Enable hibernation."
6. A confirmation dialog box will appear. Review the information provided and click "Enable hibernation" to proceed.
7. Wait for the hibernation feature to be enabled for the instance. This process may take a few minutes.
8. Once hibernation is enabled, you can now hibernate and resume the instance.
   - To hibernate the instance, you have two options:
     - Option 1: Use the AWS Management Console:
       - Select the hibernation-enabled EC2 instance.
       - Click on the "Actions" button and choose "Instance State" from the dropdown menu.
       - Click on "Hibernate" to initiate the hibernation process.
     - Option 2: Use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or SDKs:
       - Run the following AWS CLI command:
         ```
         aws ec2 hibernate-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
         ```
         Replace `<instance-id>` with the actual ID of the hibernation-enabled instance.
   - To resume a hibernated instance:
     - Start the instance using any of the standard methods, such as using the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDKs.
     - The instance will resume from the point where it was hibernated, with the in-memory data and application state preserved.
