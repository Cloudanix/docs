<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To ensure Enhanced Health Reporting is enabled for Elastic Beanstalk environments in EC2 using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI:**
   Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions to manage Elastic Beanstalk environments.
   ```sh
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Describe the Environment:**
   Retrieve the current configuration settings of your Elastic Beanstalk environment to check if Enhanced Health Reporting is enabled.
   ```sh
   aws elasticbeanstalk describe-configuration-settings --application-name <application-name> --environment-name <environment-name>
   ```

3. **Update Environment Settings:**
   Use the `aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment` command to enable Enhanced Health Reporting. Set the `HealthReportingSystem` option to `enhanced`.
   ```sh
   aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name <environment-name> --option-settings Namespace=aws:elasticbeanstalk:healthreporting:system,OptionName=SystemType,Value=enhanced
   ```

4. **Verify the Update:**
   Confirm that the Enhanced Health Reporting has been enabled by describing the environment settings again.
   ```sh
   aws elasticbeanstalk describe-configuration-settings --application-name <application-name> --environment-name <environment-name>
   ```

Replace `<application-name>` and `<environment-name>` with your actual application and environment names.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To ensure Enhanced Health Reporting is enabled for Elastic Beanstalk environments in EC2 using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**:
   Initialize the Boto3 client for Elastic Beanstalk. This will allow you to interact with the Elastic Beanstalk service.
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('elasticbeanstalk')
   ```

3. **Describe Environments**:
   Retrieve the list of environments to check their current health reporting status.
   ```python
   response = client.describe_environments()
   environments = response['Environments']
   ```

4. **Update Environment Settings**:
   For each environment, ensure that Enhanced Health Reporting is enabled by updating the environment settings.
   ```python
   for env in environments:
       env_name = env['EnvironmentName']
       env_id = env['EnvironmentId']
       
       # Check if Enhanced Health Reporting is already enabled
       settings_response = client.describe_configuration_settings(
           ApplicationName=env['ApplicationName'],
           EnvironmentName=env_name
       )
       
       health_reporting_enabled = False
       for option in settings_response['ConfigurationSettings'][0]['OptionSettings']:
           if option['Namespace'] == 'aws:elasticbeanstalk:healthreporting:system' and option['OptionName'] == 'SystemType':
               if option['Value'] == 'enhanced':
                   health_reporting_enabled = True
                   break
       
       # If not enabled, update the environment to enable it
       if not health_reporting_enabled:
           client.update_environment(
               EnvironmentName=env_name,
               OptionSettings=[
                   {
                       'Namespace': 'aws:elasticbeanstalk:healthreporting:system',
                       'OptionName': 'SystemType',
                       'Value': 'enhanced'
                   }
               ]
           )
           print(f"Enhanced Health Reporting enabled for environment: {env_name}")
       else:
           print(f"Enhanced Health Reporting already enabled for environment: {env_name}")
   ```

This script will ensure that Enhanced Health Reporting is enabled for all your Elastic Beanstalk environments. It first checks the current status and only updates the environment if Enhanced Health Reporting is not already enabled.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk console (Services -> Elastic Beanstalk).
3. In the navigation pane, choose "Environments", and then choose the name of your environment from the list.
4. In the navigation pane, choose "Configuration". In the "Monitoring" category, choose "Edit".
5. Check the "Health Reporting" section. If the "Health Reporting" is not set to "Enhanced", then Enhanced Health Reporting is not enabled for your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Elastic Beanstalk environments.

2. Once the AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can list all the Elastic Beanstalk environments using the following command:

   ```
   aws elasticbeanstalk describe-environments --region your-region
   ```
   Replace 'your-region' with the region where your Elastic Beanstalk environments are located. This command will return a JSON output with details of all the environments.

3. To check if Enhanced Health Reporting is enabled for a specific environment, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws elasticbeanstalk describe-environment-health --environment-name your-environment-name --attribute-names All --region your-region
   ```
   Replace 'your-environment-name' with the name of your Elastic Beanstalk environment and 'your-region' with the region where your environment is located. This command will return a JSON output with the health status of the specified environment.

4. In the JSON output, look for the "HealthStatus" field. If Enhanced Health Reporting is enabled, the value of this field should be "Ok". If it's not, then Enhanced Health Reporting is not enabled for that environment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if Enhanced Health Reporting is enabled for Elastic Beanstalk Environments in EC2 using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary libraries**: You need to import Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python, to interact with AWS services.

    ```python
    import boto3
    ```

2. **Create an AWS session**: You need to create a session using your AWS credentials.

    ```python
    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
        region_name='us-west-2'
    )
    ```

3. **Create an Elastic Beanstalk client**: Use the session to create a client for Elastic Beanstalk.

    ```python
    client = session.client('elasticbeanstalk')
    ```

4. **Check the health reporting system type**: You can now use the client to describe your environments and check the health reporting system type. If the type is "enhanced", then Enhanced Health Reporting is enabled.

    ```python
    response = client.describe_environments()
    for environment in response['Environments']:
        if environment['Health'] != 'enhanced':
            print(f"Enhanced Health Reporting is not enabled for {environment['EnvironmentName']}")
    ```

This script will print the names of all environments where Enhanced Health Reporting is not enabled. Replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your actual AWS access and secret keys.
