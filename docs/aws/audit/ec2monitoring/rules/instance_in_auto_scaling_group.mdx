How to launch instances in Auto Scaling Group?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
2. From the left navigation pane, click on "Auto Scaling Groups" under the "Auto Scaling" section.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Instance Should Be Launched In Auto Scaling Group" Policy.)
3. Click on the "Create Auto Scaling group" button.
4. Configure the Auto Scaling group settings:
   - Step 1: Configure Auto Scaling group details:
     - Provide a name for your Auto Scaling group.
     - Select the desired launch template or launch configuration for your instances. If you don't have one, you can create a new launch template in this step.
     - Select the subnet(s) where you want to launch the instances.
     - Choose the desired VPC and availability zones.
     - Specify the desired capacity for your group, including the minimum, maximum, and desired number of instances.
   - Step 2: Configure advanced options (optional):
     - Configure any additional advanced options, such as instance protection, scaling policies, and health checks. These settings depend on your specific requirements.
   - Step 3: Add tags (optional):
     - Add any required tags to the instances for identification or management purposes.
   - Step 4: Configure scaling policies (optional):
     - Configure scaling policies to automatically scale the group based on predefined rules, such as CPU utilization or network traffic.
   - Step 5: Review and create:
     - Review all the configured settings and make sure they are accurate.
     - Click on "Create Auto Scaling group" to create the group.
5. Wait for the Auto Scaling group to be created. This process may take a few minutes.
6. Once the Auto Scaling group is created, instances will be launched automatically based on the defined configuration. The number of instances will scale up or down based on the scaling policies and triggers you have configured.
