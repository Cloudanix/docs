How to update security group inbound configuration to restrict Oracle Database access to specific entities?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 service and select the security group that needs to be updated.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Unrestricted Oracle Access Should Not Be Allowed" Policy.)
3. Click on the "Inbound Rules" tab.
4. Locate the rule that allows access to the Oracle Database.
5. Edit the rule and change the source IP address to the specific entities that should have access to the database.
6. If the entities are within the same VPC, you can use the VPC security group ID as the source instead of the IP address.
7. If the entities are outside the VPC, you can use their public IP addresses or CIDR blocks as the source.
8. Save the changes to the security group.
