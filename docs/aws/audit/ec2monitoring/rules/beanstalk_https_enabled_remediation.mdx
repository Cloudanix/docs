### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk service.
2. Select the appropriate environment for which you want to check the HTTPS enforcement.
3. In the environment overview page, click on the 'Configuration' link in the sidebar.
4. In the configuration page, look for the 'Load Balancer' category and click on the 'Edit' button. Here, you can check if the 'Listener port' is set to 443 (HTTPS) and if the 'Protocol' is set to HTTPS. If not, then HTTPS is not enforced for the Elastic Beanstalk Load Balancer.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Once you have AWS CLI installed and configured, you can proceed to the next steps.

2. List all the Elastic Beanstalk environments using the following command:
   ```
   aws elasticbeanstalk describe-environments --output json
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the Elastic Beanstalk environments.

3. For each environment, list the resources using the following command:
   ```
   aws elasticbeanstalk describe-environment-resources --environment-name <EnvironmentName> --output json
   ```
   Replace `<EnvironmentName>` with the name of your environment. This command will return a JSON output with details of all the resources associated with the specified environment.

4. Check the LoadBalancerDescription field in the output. If the ListenerDescriptions field contains a listener with the LoadBalancerPort set to 80 and the Protocol set to HTTP, then HTTPS is not enforced for the Elastic Beanstalk Load Balancer.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. This can be done using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key'
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_key'
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check the HTTPS enforcement: The following Python script uses Boto3 to list all the Elastic Beanstalk environments and checks if the Load Balancer is configured to enforce HTTPS:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_https_enforcement():
       client = boto3.client('elasticbeanstalk')
       environments = client.describe_environments()
       for environment in environments['Environments']:
           option_settings = client.describe_configuration_options(
               ApplicationName=environment['ApplicationName'],
               EnvironmentName=environment['EnvironmentName']
           )
           for option in option_settings['Options']:
               if option['Namespace'] == 'aws:elbv2:listener:443' and option['OptionName'] == 'Protocol':
                   if option['Value'].lower() != 'https':
                       print(f"HTTPS not enforced for environment: {environment['EnvironmentName']}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_https_enforcement()
   ```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using the Python interpreter. The script will print the names of the Elastic Beanstalk environments where HTTPS is not enforced:

   ```bash
   python check_https_enforcement.py
   ```

Please note that this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to list and describe Elastic Beanstalk environments and their configuration options. If you don't have these permissions, you need to adjust your IAM policy accordingly.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "Enforce HTTPS for Elastic Beanstalk Load Balancers" for AWS using AWS console:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk service.
3. Select the environment that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Configuration" tab in the left-hand menu.
5. Scroll down to the "Load Balancer" section and click on "Edit".
6. In the "Listeners" section, click on the "Add listener" button.
7. Select "HTTPS" as the protocol and enter the appropriate port number (usually 443).
8. Choose the SSL certificate that you want to use from the drop-down list.
9. In the "Rules" section, click on the "Add rule" button.
10. Choose "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" from the drop-down list.
11. Click on the "Apply" button to save the changes.
12. Wait for the environment to update and the changes to take effect.

Once these steps are completed, your Elastic Beanstalk Load Balancer will enforce HTTPS and redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

#### Using CLI

To enforce HTTPS for Elastic Beanstalk Load Balancers in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

Step 1: Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

Step 2: Run the following command to update the Elastic Beanstalk environment to use HTTPS:

```
aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name <your-environment-name> --option-settings Namespace=aws:elb:listener:443,OptionName=ListenerProtocol,Value=HTTPS --option-settings Namespace=aws:elb:listener:443,OptionName=SSLCertificateId,Value=<your-ssl-certificate-id>
```

Note: Replace `<your-environment-name>` with the name of your Elastic Beanstalk environment and `<your-ssl-certificate-id>` with the ID of your SSL certificate.

Step 3: Run the following command to verify that HTTPS is now enforced:

```
aws elasticbeanstalk describe-environment-resources --environment-name <your-environment-name> --query "EnvironmentResources.LoadBalancer.Url"
```

Note: Replace `<your-environment-name>` with the name of your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

This command will return the URL of the Elastic Beanstalk Load Balancer with HTTPS protocol.

By following the above steps, you can enforce HTTPS for Elastic Beanstalk Load Balancers in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Enforce HTTPS for Elastic Beanstalk Load Balancers" in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk environment that needs to be remediated.

2. Click on the "Configuration" tab and then click on the "Load Balancer" section.

3. Under the "Listeners" section, click on the "Edit" button.

4. In the "Add listener" dialog box, select "HTTPS" from the "Protocol" dropdown menu.

6. Click on the "Add" button to add the HTTPS listener.

7. Under the "Rules" section, click on the "Edit" button.

8. In the "Add rule" dialog box, select "HTTPS" from the "Protocol" dropdown menu.

9. In the "Path" field, enter "/*".

10. In the "Redirect to" field, enter "https://#{host}:#{port}/#{path}?#{query}".

11. Click on the "Add" button to add the HTTPS redirect rule.

12. Click on the "Apply" button to save the changes.

To automate the above steps using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here's an example code snippet to enforce HTTPS for an Elastic Beanstalk Load Balancer:

```
import boto3

# Replace with your AWS access key ID and secret access key
aws_access_key_id = 'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
aws_secret_access_key = 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'

# Replace with the name of your Elastic Beanstalk environment
environment_name = 'YOUR_ELASTIC_BEANSTALK_ENVIRONMENT_NAME'

# Create an Elastic Beanstalk client
eb_client = boto3.client('elasticbeanstalk', aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key)

# Get the Elastic Beanstalk environment details
environment = eb_client.describe_environments(EnvironmentNames=[environment_name])['Environments'][0]

# Get the Load Balancer ARN
load_balancer_arn = environment['LoadBalancers'][0]['Name']

# Create an Elastic Load Balancing client
elb_client = boto3.client('elbv2', aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key)

# Create the HTTPS listener
elb_client.create_listener(
    LoadBalancerArn=load_balancer_arn,
    Protocol='HTTPS',
    Port=443,
    SslPolicy='ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08',
    Certificates=[
        {
            'CertificateArn': 'YOUR_SSL_CERTIFICATE_ARN'
        }
    ]
)

# Create the HTTPS redirect rule
elb_client.create_rule(
    ListenerArn='YOUR_HTTPS_LISTENER_ARN',
    Conditions=[
        {
            'Field': 'path-pattern',
            'Values': [
                '/*'
            ]
        }
    ],
    Actions=[
        {
            'Type': 'redirect',
            'RedirectConfig': {
                'Protocol': 'HTTPS',
                'Port': '443',
                'StatusCode': 'HTTP_301',
                'Host': '#{host}',
                'Path': '/#{path}',
                'Query': '#{query}'
            }
        }
    ]
)
```

Note: Replace the placeholders in the code with your own values. Also, make sure that you have installed the Boto3 library before running the code.
