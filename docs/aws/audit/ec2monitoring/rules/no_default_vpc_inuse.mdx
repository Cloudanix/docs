How to ensure that the EC2 instances in your AWS account are not associated with default VPCs?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Login to your AWS account and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. Click on the "Instances" option in the left-hand menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Default VPC Should Not Be In Use" Policy.)
3. Select the instance for which you want to check the VPC association.
4. Check the VPC column in the instance details. If the VPC is listed as "default", it means that the instance is associated with the default VPC.
5. To remediate this misconfiguration, you can either create a new VPC and associate the instance with it or associate the instance with an existing non-default VPC.
6. To associate the instance with a non-default VPC, go to the "Actions" menu and select "Security" -> "Change Security Groups".
7. In the "Change Security Groups" dialog box, select the non-default VPC from the "VPC" dropdown menu.
8. Select the appropriate security group(s) for the instance and click on the "Assign Security Groups" button.
9. Once the security groups are assigned, the instance will be associated with the non-default VPC.
10. Repeat these steps for all instances in your AWS account that are associated with default VPCs to ensure that they are properly secured.
