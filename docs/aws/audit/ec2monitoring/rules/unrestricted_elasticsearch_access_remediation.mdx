How to update the security group inbound configuration to restrict Elasticsearch access to specific entities?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the navigation panel, under NETWORK & SECURITY section, choose Security Groups. Select the appropriate security group.
  (see Audit section to identify the right one(s)).

- Step 2: Select the Inbound tab from the dashboard bottom panel and click the Edit button.

- Step 3: In the Edit inbound rules dialog box, change the traffic Source for any inbound rules that allow unrestricted access through TCP port 9200 by performing one of the following actions:
  A: Select My IP from the Source dropdown list to allow inbound traffic only from your machine (from your IP address).
  B: Select Custom from the Source dropdown list and enter one of the following options based on your access requirements:
  a. The static IP/Elastic IP address of the permitted host with the suffix set to /32, e.g. 54.164.53.221/32.
  b. The IP address range of the permitted hosts in CIDR notation, for example 54.164.53.221/24.
  c. The name or ID of another security group available in the same AWS region.

- Step 4: Click Save to apply the changes.
