### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent unrestricted SMTP access in EC2 using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Security Groups:**
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - In the navigation pane, choose "EC2" under the "Compute" section.
   - In the left-hand menu, select "Security Groups."

2. **Identify the Relevant Security Group:**
   - Locate the security group associated with your EC2 instance that you want to modify.
   - Click on the security group ID to view its details.

3. **Review Inbound Rules:**
   - In the security group details, go to the "Inbound rules" tab.
   - Look for any rules that allow unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0) on port 25 (SMTP).

4. **Modify or Remove Inbound Rules:**
   - If you find any unrestricted rules for port 25, either modify the source IP range to a more restrictive range or remove the rule entirely.
   - Click "Edit inbound rules," make the necessary changes, and then click "Save rules."

By following these steps, you can ensure that SMTP access is not unrestricted, thereby enhancing the security of your EC2 instances.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent unrestricted SMTP access in EC2 using AWS CLI, you need to modify the security group rules to restrict access to port 25 (SMTP). Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the Security Group:**
   First, identify the security group associated with your EC2 instance.

   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id> --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].SecurityGroups[*].GroupId' --output text
   ```

2. **Revoke Unrestricted Inbound Rules:**
   Revoke any existing inbound rules that allow unrestricted access to port 25.

   ```sh
   aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 25 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
   ```

3. **Add Restricted Inbound Rules:**
   Add a new inbound rule to allow access to port 25 only from specific IP addresses or ranges.

   ```sh
   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 25 --cidr <allowed-ip-range>
   ```

4. **Verify the Security Group Rules:**
   Verify that the security group rules have been updated correctly.

   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>
   ```

Replace `<instance-id>`, `<security-group-id>`, and `<allowed-ip-range>` with your specific instance ID, security group ID, and the IP range you want to allow.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent unrestricted SMTP access in EC2 using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Install Boto3 Library**:
   Ensure you have the Boto3 library installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by creating a `~/.aws/credentials` file.

3. **Create a Python Script to Modify Security Groups**:
   Write a Python script to find and update security groups that allow unrestricted SMTP access (port 25).

4. **Implement the Script**:
   Below is a sample Python script to prevent unrestricted SMTP access by removing inbound rules that allow access to port 25 from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0):

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon EC2
   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   # Describe all security groups
   response = ec2.describe_security_groups()

   for sg in response['SecurityGroups']:
       sg_id = sg['GroupId']
       for permission in sg['IpPermissions']:
           if permission['IpProtocol'] == 'tcp' and permission['FromPort'] == 25 and permission['ToPort'] == 25:
               for ip_range in permission['IpRanges']:
                   if ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                       # Revoke the rule that allows unrestricted access to port 25
                       ec2.revoke_security_group_ingress(
                           GroupId=sg_id,
                           IpProtocol='tcp',
                           FromPort=25,
                           ToPort=25,
                           CidrIp='0.0.0.0/0'
                       )
                       print(f"Revoked unrestricted SMTP access for security group {sg_id}")

   print("Completed checking and updating security groups.")
   ```

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Install Boto3**: Ensure Boto3 is installed.
2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**: Configure your AWS credentials.
3. **Create a Python Script**: Write a script to identify and modify security groups.
4. **Implement the Script**: Use the script to revoke unrestricted SMTP access.

This script will help you prevent unrestricted SMTP access by modifying the security group rules in your AWS environment.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, select 'Security Groups'. This will display a list of all security groups associated with your AWS account.
3. For each security group, select it and then click on the 'Inbound Rules' tab in the lower panel. This will display a list of all inbound rules associated with the selected security group.
4. Check the inbound rules for any that allow unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) to port 25 (SMTP). If such a rule exists, it indicates that unrestricted SMTP access is allowed, which is a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all security groups: The first step to detect unrestricted SMTP access is to list all the security groups in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following command: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId]' --output text`

3. Check security group rules: For each security group, you need to check the inbound rules to see if they allow unrestricted SMTP access. You can do this by running the following command for each security group: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query 'SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions[*]' --output json`

4. Analyze the output: The output of the above command will be a JSON object that contains all the inbound rules for the specified security group. You need to analyze this output to see if there are any rules that allow unrestricted SMTP access. Specifically, you need to look for rules where the `IpProtocol` is `tcp`, the `FromPort` is `25` (the port used by SMTP), and the `IpRanges.CidrIp` is `0.0.0.0/0` (which means all IP addresses are allowed). If such a rule exists, then unrestricted SMTP access is allowed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using pip. This SDK allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc.

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Configure your AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating the credentials file yourself (`.aws/credentials` at the root of your user directory). At a minimum, it should look like the following:

```python
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

3. Create a Python script: Now, you can create a Python script that uses Boto3 to interact with your AWS resources. In this case, you want to check if unrestricted SMTP access is allowed in EC2. Here is a simple script that does this:

```python
import boto3

def check_smtp_access():
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
    security_groups = ec2.security_groups.all()

    for group in security_groups:
        for permission in group.ip_permissions:
            # Check if the permission allows SMTP access (port 25)
            if permission['FromPort'] == 25 and permission['ToPort'] == 25:
                for range in permission['IpRanges']:
                    # Check if the range is 0.0.0.0/0 (unrestricted access)
                    if range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                        print(f"Unrestricted SMTP access allowed in security group {group.id}")

check_smtp_access()
```

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run the script using your Python interpreter. If any security groups allow unrestricted SMTP access, their IDs will be printed to the console.

```python
python check_smtp_access.py
```

This script will help you identify any security groups that allow unrestricted SMTP access, which is a potential security risk.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the unrestricted SMTP access issue in AWS, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.
2. Select the EC2 instance that is allowing unrestricted SMTP access.
3. Click on the "Security" tab and scroll down to the "Security groups" section.
4. Click on the security group that is associated with the instance.
5. Click on the "Inbound rules" tab.
6. Locate the rule that allows SMTP traffic (port 25) with the source of "0.0.0.0/0" or "::/0".
7. Click on the "Edit" button next to the rule.
8. Change the source to a specific IP address range or security group that requires SMTP access.
9. Click the "Save" button to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the unrestricted SMTP access issue in AWS.

#
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this issue in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to list all the active SMTP settings in the AWS account:

```
aws ses get-account-sending-enabled
```

3. If the command output shows that the "SendingEnabled" parameter is set to "true", then you need to disable it. Run the following command to disable SMTP access:

```
aws ses update-account-sending-enabled --no-sending-enabled
```

4. After running the above command, verify that the "SendingEnabled" parameter is set to "false" by running the following command:

```
aws ses get-account-sending-enabled
```

5. If the "SendingEnabled" parameter is set to "false", then SMTP access has been successfully restricted in your AWS account.

Note: This remediation will disable SMTP access for all users in your AWS account. If you need to enable SMTP access for specific users, you can create an IAM policy that allows SMTP access and attach it to their IAM user or role.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate unrestricted SMTP access in AWS using Python, you can follow the steps below:

1. Create a Python script to check for SMTP access:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('ec2')
response = client.describe_security_groups()

for group in response['SecurityGroups']:
    for permission in group['IpPermissions']:
        if permission.get('FromPort') == 25 and permission.get('IpRanges') == [{'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'}]:
            group_id = group['GroupId']
            print(f"Found unrestricted SMTP access in security group {group_id}")
```

2. Once you have identified the security group(s) with unrestricted SMTP access, you can update the security group rules to restrict SMTP access to specific IP addresses or ranges.

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('ec2')
response = client.authorize_security_group_ingress(
    GroupId='SECURITY_GROUP_ID',
    IpPermissions=[
        {
            'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
            'FromPort': 25,
            'ToPort': 25,
            'IpRanges': [
                {
                    'CidrIp': 'ALLOWED_IP_ADDRESS/32'
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
```

Replace `SECURITY_GROUP_ID` with the ID of the security group that needs to be updated and `ALLOWED_IP_ADDRESS` with the IP address or range that should be allowed to access SMTP.

3. Run the Python script to check for and remediate unrestricted SMTP access in AWS.
