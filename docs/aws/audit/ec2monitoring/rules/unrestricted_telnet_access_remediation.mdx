1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the left navigation pane, select "Security Groups" under the "Network & Security" section.
3. In the main pane, you will see a list of all your security groups. Select the security group you want to inspect for unrestricted Telnet access.
4. In the lower pane, select the "Inbound rules" tab. This will display all the inbound rules associated with the selected security group.
5. Look for any rules where the "Type" is "Telnet" (port 23) and the "Source" is "0.0.0.0/0" or "::/0". This indicates that Telnet access is allowed from any IP address, which is a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions on the official AWS CLI User Guide. Once installed, you need to configure it with your AWS credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all security groups: The first step to detect unrestricted Telnet access is to list all the security groups in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following command: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query "SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId]" --output text`

3. Check security group rules: For each security group, you need to check the inbound rules to see if any of them allow unrestricted Telnet access. You can do this by running the following command for each security group: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query "SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions[*]" --output text`

4. Detect unrestricted Telnet access: In the output of the previous command, look for rules that have `IpProtocol` set to `tcp`, `FromPort` set to `23`, and `IpRanges.CidrIp` set to `0.0.0.0/0`. This indicates that the security group allows unrestricted Telnet access. If you find any such rules, it means that unrestricted Telnet access is allowed in your EC2 instances.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   First, you need to install Boto3. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3`. After installing Boto3, you need to configure it. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. Import necessary libraries and establish a session:
   In your Python script, you need to import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS. Here is an example:

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ec2 = session.resource('ec2')
   ```

3. Iterate over all security groups and check for unrestricted Telnet access:
   You can do this by iterating over all security groups and checking if they allow unrestricted Telnet access (port 23). Here is an example:

   ```python
   for security_group in ec2.security_groups.all():
       for permission in security_group.ip_permissions:
           for ip_range in permission['IpRanges']:
               if '0.0.0.0/0' in ip_range['CidrIp'] and permission['FromPort'] == 23:
                   print(f"Security Group {security_group.id} allows unrestricted Telnet access.")
   ```

4. Run the script:
   Finally, you can run the script by using the command `python script_name.py`. If there are any security groups that allow unrestricted Telnet access, they will be printed out.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of unrestricted Telnet access in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
3. Click on the Security Groups option from the left navigation pane.
4. Select the security group that has unrestricted Telnet access.
5. Click on the Inbound Rules tab.
6. Locate the rule that allows Telnet access (port 23) and select it.
7. Click on the Delete button to remove the rule.
8. Click on the Save Rules button to save the changes.

This will remove the unrestricted Telnet access from the security group and help remediate the misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the unrestricted Telnet access in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the steps below:

1. Open your terminal and configure your AWS CLI with the necessary credentials.

2. Run the following command to list all the security groups in your AWS account:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups
```

3. Identify the security group that has unrestricted Telnet access. Look for the security group that has port 23 open to all IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0).

4. Note down the security group ID of the identified security group.

5. Run the following command to revoke the Telnet access from the identified security group:

```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 23 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the identified security group.

6. Verify that the Telnet access has been revoked by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>
```

This should show that the Telnet access has been removed from the identified security group.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the unrestricted Telnet access in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the unrestricted Telnet access misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to identify the security group(s) that have unrestricted Telnet access. You can use the following Python code to retrieve the security groups:

```
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

# Get all security groups
security_groups = list(ec2.security_groups.all())

# Loop through each security group
for sg in security_groups:
    # Check if Telnet access is allowed
    for rule in sg.ip_permissions:
        if rule['IpProtocol'] == 'tcp' and rule['FromPort'] == 23 and rule['ToPort'] == 23:
            print(f"Security Group {sg.group_id} allows unrestricted Telnet access")
```

2. Once you have identified the security group(s) that have unrestricted Telnet access, you can remove the Telnet rule(s) from the security group(s). You can use the following Python code to remove the Telnet rule(s):

```
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

# Get the security group by ID
sg = ec2.SecurityGroup('sg-0123456789abcdef')

# Revoke the Telnet access rule(s)
sg.revoke_ingress(IpProtocol='tcp', FromPort=23, ToPort=23, CidrIp='0.0.0.0/0')
```

In the above code, replace 'sg-0123456789abcdef' with the ID of the security group that you want to remediate.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the unrestricted Telnet access misconfiguration in AWS using Python.
