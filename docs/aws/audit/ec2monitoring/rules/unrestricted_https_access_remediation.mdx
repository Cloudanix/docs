1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the left navigation pane, under the "NETWORK & SECURITY" section, click on "Security Groups".
3. In the Security Groups page, you will see a list of all the security groups associated with your EC2 instances. Click on the security group that you want to check.
4. In the details pane at the bottom, click on the "Inbound" tab. Here, you can see all the inbound rules for this security group. If there is a rule that allows unrestricted HTTPS access (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 in the source), then this is a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all security groups: Once your AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the security groups in your account by running the following command:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query "SecurityGroups[*].{Name:GroupName,ID:GroupId}"
   ```
   This command will return a list of all security groups along with their names and IDs.

3. Check security group rules: For each security group, you need to check the inbound rules to see if they allow unrestricted HTTPS access. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query 'SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions[*]'
   ```
   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group you want to check. This command will return a list of all inbound rules for the specified security group.

4. Detect unrestricted HTTPS access: In the output of the previous command, look for rules where the `IpProtocol` is `tcp`, the `FromPort` is `443`, and the `IpRanges` includes `0.0.0.0/0`. This indicates that the security group allows unrestricted HTTPS access.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install Boto3 in your Python environment. You can do this using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing Boto3, you need to configure it. You can do this by creating a new session using your AWS credentials:
   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='YOUR_REGION'
   )
   ```

2. List all security groups:
   Use the `describe_security_groups` method to get a list of all security groups in your AWS account:
   ```python
   ec2 = session.resource('ec2')
   security_groups = ec2.describe_security_groups()
   ```

3. Check each security group for unrestricted HTTPS access:
   For each security group, check if it has a rule that allows unrestricted HTTPS access. This can be done by checking if the security group has a rule with `IpProtocol` set to 'tcp', `FromPort` and `ToPort` set to 443 (the port for HTTPS), and `CidrIp` set to '0.0.0.0/0' (which means all IP addresses):
   ```python
   for group in security_groups['SecurityGroups']:
       for permission in group['IpPermissions']:
           if permission['IpProtocol'] == 'tcp' and permission['FromPort'] == 443 and permission['ToPort'] == 443:
               for range in permission['IpRanges']:
                   if range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                       print(f"Security group {group['GroupId']} allows unrestricted HTTPS access")
   ```

4. Run the script:
   Finally, run the script. If there are any security groups that allow unrestricted HTTPS access, they will be printed out. If there are no such security groups, nothing will be printed out. This way, you can easily detect if unrestricted HTTPS access is allowed in your AWS EC2 instances.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the "Unrestricted HTTPS Access Should Not Be Allowed" misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS EC2 service.
3. Click on the "Security Groups" option from the left-hand menu.
4. Select the security group that is associated with the instance(s) that have unrestricted HTTPS access.
5. Click on the "Inbound Rules" tab.
6. Locate the HTTPS rule that has unrestricted access (i.e., source is set to "0.0.0.0/0" or "::/0").
7. Click on the "Edit" button for the rule.
8. Change the source to a more restrictive IP range or security group that requires HTTPS access.
9. Click on the "Save Rules" button to apply the changes.

Note: If you are unsure which security group is associated with the instance(s) that have unrestricted HTTPS access, you can view the instance details to find the security group ID and then navigate to the Security Groups section to find the security group.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of unrestricted HTTPS access in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

Step 1: Open the AWS CLI in your terminal or command prompt.

Step 2: Run the following command to list all the security groups in your AWS account:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups
```

Step 3: Identify the security group(s) that have unrestricted HTTPS access allowed.

Step 4: Run the following command to remove the HTTPS access rule from the identified security group(s):

```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security_group_id> --protocol tcp --port 443 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

Note: Replace `<security_group_id>` with the actual ID of the security group that needs to be remediated.

Step 5: Verify that the HTTPS access rule has been removed by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-id <security_group_id>
```

Note: Replace `<security_group_id>` with the actual ID of the security group that was remediated.

Step 6: Repeat the above steps for all the security groups that have unrestricted HTTPS access allowed.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of unrestricted HTTPS access in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the unrestricted HTTPS access issue in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Identify the Security Group(s) which are allowing unrestricted HTTPS access.
2. Using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3), modify the inbound rules of the identified Security Group(s) to allow HTTPS access only from trusted sources.
3. Create a script to automate this process for all the Security Group(s) in your AWS account.

Here is a sample Python code to remediate the issue:

```
import boto3

# Define the AWS region and security group id
region = 'us-east-1'
security_group_id = 'sg-0123456789abcdef'

# Create an EC2 client
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region)

# Get the existing inbound rules of the security group
response = ec2.describe_security_groups(GroupIds=[security_group_id])

# Modify the inbound rules to allow HTTPS access only from trusted sources
ec2.authorize_security_group_ingress(
    GroupId=security_group_id,
    IpPermissions=[
        {
            'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
            'FromPort': 443,
            'ToPort': 443,
            'IpRanges': [
                {
                    'CidrIp': 'trusted_ip_address/32'
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
```

Note: Replace the `region` and `security_group_id` variables with your own values. Also, replace the `trusted_ip_address` with the IP address(es) of the trusted sources that should be allowed HTTPS access.
