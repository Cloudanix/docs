1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

2. In the navigation pane, under "INSTANCES" section, click on "Instances".

3. This will open up a list of all your EC2 instances. Here, you can see the details of each instance including its instance type.

4. To check if an EC2 instance is of the desired type, look at the "Instance Type" column of the table. If the instance type does not match your desired type, then it is a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 instances: Use the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 describe-instances` to list all the EC2 instances in your AWS account. This command will return a JSON output with detailed information about each EC2 instance.

3. Extract instance types: You can extract the instance types from the JSON output using the `jq` command-line JSON processor. The command would look something like this: `aws ec2 describe-instances | jq -r '.Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceType'`. This command will return a list of instance types for all your EC2 instances.

4. Check instance types: Now, you can check if the instance types match your desired type. For example, if your desired type is 't2.micro', you can modify the previous command to something like this: `aws ec2 describe-instances | jq -r '.Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceType' | grep -v 't2.micro'`. This command will return a list of instances that are not of type 't2.micro'. If the list is empty, it means all your instances are of the desired type.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3, AWS EC2, AWS DynamoDB, and much more. To install Boto3, you can use pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   You also need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws configure
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules and create an EC2 resource object: You need to import the boto3 module in your Python script and create an EC2 resource object using your AWS credentials.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create an EC2 resource object using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)
   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
   ```

3. Retrieve all EC2 instances: You can use the `instances.all()` method to retrieve all EC2 instances.

   ```python
   # Retrieve all EC2 instances
   instances = ec2.instances.all()
   ```

4. Check the instance type of each EC2 instance: You can use the `instance_type` attribute of an EC2 instance to check its type. If the instance type is not the desired type, you can print a message or perform some other action.

   ```python
   # Desired instance type
   desired_instance_type = 't2.micro'

   # Check the instance type of each EC2 instance
   for instance in instances:
       if instance.instance_type != desired_instance_type:
           print(f'Instance {instance.id} is not of the desired type ({desired_instance_type}). It is of type {instance.instance_type}.')
   ```
   This script will print a message for each EC2 instance that is not of the desired type.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Instance Should Be of Desired Type" for AWS, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.

3. Identify the EC2 instance that is not of the desired type.

4. Stop the instance.

5. Select the instance and click on the "Actions" button.

6. Click on "Instance Settings" and then click on "Change Instance Type".

7. Select the desired instance type from the list and click on "Apply".

8. Start the instance again.

9. Verify that the instance type has been changed to the desired type.

Congratulations! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "EC2 Instance Should Be of Desired Type" for AWS using AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Instance Should Be of Desired Type" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the instance that is not of the desired type. You can use the following command to list all your instances:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances
   ```

2. Once you have identified the instance, stop the instance using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance you want to stop.

3. After the instance has been stopped, modify its instance type using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --instance-type <instance-type>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance you want to modify and `<instance-type>` with the desired instance type.

4. Start the instance using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance you want to start.

5. Verify that the instance is running and has the desired instance type using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance you want to verify.

Your EC2 instance should now be of the desired type.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of an EC2 instance type in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDKs and libraries in Python, such as boto3.

2. Connect to your AWS account using the AWS SDK for Python.

3. Retrieve the list of all EC2 instances in your account using the `describe_instances` method of the EC2 client.

4. For each EC2 instance, check if the instance type matches the desired type. If it does not match, use the `modify_instance_attribute` method of the EC2 client to change the instance type to the desired type.

5. Confirm that the instance type has been updated by checking the instance details using the `describe_instances` method.

Here is a sample Python code that can be used to remediate the misconfiguration of an EC2 instance type in AWS:

```
import boto3

# Connect to AWS
ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

# Retrieve list of all EC2 instances
instances = ec2_client.describe_instances()

# Check and update instance type for each instance
for reservation in instances['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
        current_instance_type = instance['InstanceType']
        desired_instance_type = 't2.micro' # Change this to your desired instance type
        
        if current_instance_type != desired_instance_type:
            ec2_client.modify_instance_attribute(InstanceId=instance_id, Attribute='instanceType', Value=desired_instance_type)
            print(f"Instance type updated for instance {instance_id}")
        else:
            print(f"Instance {instance_id} already has the desired instance type.")
```

Note that this is just a sample code and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements. Also, make sure to test the code in a non-production environment before using it in production.
