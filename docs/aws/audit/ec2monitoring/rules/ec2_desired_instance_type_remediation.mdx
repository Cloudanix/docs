### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

2. In the navigation pane, under "INSTANCES" section, click on "Instances".

3. In the "Instances" page, you will see a list of all your EC2 instances. Here, you can check the "Instance Type" column to see the type of each instance.

4. If the instance type does not match your desired type, then it is a misconfiguration. You can also filter the instances by instance type to quickly find instances that are not of the desired type.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 instances: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the EC2 instances in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the EC2 instances.

3. Filter EC2 instances by instance type: You can filter the output of the above command to only show instances of a specific type. For example, if you want to check if there are any instances of type 't2.micro', you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-type,Values=t2.micro"
   ```
   This command will return a list of all 't2.micro' instances.

4. Analyze the output: If the output of the above command is empty, it means there are no 't2.micro' instances in your AWS account. If the output contains details of one or more instances, it means there are 't2.micro' instances in your AWS account. You can then take appropriate action based on this information.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. You can configure it in several ways. The easiest way is to use the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   It will prompt you for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format. Enter the details accordingly.

3. Write the Python script: Now, you can write a Python script to check if the EC2 instance is of the desired type. Here is a simple script that lists all EC2 instances and their types:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_instances():
       ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
       for instance in ec2.instances.all():
           print('ID: {}, Type: {}'.format(instance.id, instance.instance_type))

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       list_instances()
   ```

   This script will print the ID and type of all EC2 instances. You can modify it to check if the instance type matches your desired type.

4. Run the Python script: Finally, you can run the Python script using the Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

   Replace "script_name.py" with the name of your Python script. The script will print the ID and type of all EC2 instances. If the instance type does not match your desired type, you have detected a misconfiguration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Instance Should Be of Desired Type" for AWS, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.

3. Identify the EC2 instance that is not of the desired type.

4. Stop the instance.

5. Select the instance and click on the "Actions" button.

6. Click on "Instance Settings" and then click on "Change Instance Type".

7. Select the desired instance type from the list and click on "Apply".

8. Start the instance again.

9. Verify that the instance type has been changed to the desired type.

Congratulations! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "EC2 Instance Should Be of Desired Type" for AWS using AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Instance Should Be of Desired Type" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the instance that is not of the desired type. You can use the following command to list all your instances:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances
   ```

2. Once you have identified the instance, stop the instance using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance you want to stop.

3. After the instance has been stopped, modify its instance type using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --instance-type <instance-type>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance you want to modify and `<instance-type>` with the desired instance type.

4. Start the instance using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance you want to start.

5. Verify that the instance is running and has the desired instance type using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance you want to verify.

Your EC2 instance should now be of the desired type.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of an EC2 instance type in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDKs and libraries in Python, such as boto3.

2. Connect to your AWS account using the AWS SDK for Python.

3. Retrieve the list of all EC2 instances in your account using the `describe_instances` method of the EC2 client.

4. For each EC2 instance, check if the instance type matches the desired type. If it does not match, use the `modify_instance_attribute` method of the EC2 client to change the instance type to the desired type.

5. Confirm that the instance type has been updated by checking the instance details using the `describe_instances` method.

Here is a sample Python code that can be used to remediate the misconfiguration of an EC2 instance type in AWS:

```
import boto3

# Connect to AWS
ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

# Retrieve list of all EC2 instances
instances = ec2_client.describe_instances()

# Check and update instance type for each instance
for reservation in instances['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
        current_instance_type = instance['InstanceType']
        desired_instance_type = 't2.micro' # Change this to your desired instance type
        
        if current_instance_type != desired_instance_type:
            ec2_client.modify_instance_attribute(InstanceId=instance_id, Attribute='instanceType', Value=desired_instance_type)
            print(f"Instance type updated for instance {instance_id}")
        else:
            print(f"Instance {instance_id} already has the desired instance type.")
```

Note that this is just a sample code and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements. Also, make sure to test the code in a non-production environment before using it in production.
