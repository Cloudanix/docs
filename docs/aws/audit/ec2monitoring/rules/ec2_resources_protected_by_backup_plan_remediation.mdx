### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "Instances", click on "Instances" to open your EC2 instances dashboard.
3. Select the EC2 instance that you want to check for backup plan protection.
4. In the bottom panel, click on the "Tags" tab. Look for a tag named "Backup" or similar to check if a backup plan is in place. If there is no such tag, it's likely that the instance does not have a backup plan.
5. Additionally, you can navigate to the AWS Backup service in the AWS console. Here, you can check if the selected EC2 instance is included in any backup jobs. If it's not listed in any backup jobs, it does not have a backup plan.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 instances: Use the following command to list all EC2 instances in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId]' --output text
   ```

   This command will return a list of all EC2 instance IDs.

3. Check for backup plans: For each EC2 instance ID returned by the previous command, you need to check if there is a backup plan associated with it. You can do this by using the following command:

   ```
   aws backup describe-backup-job --backup-job-id <instance-id>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the EC2 instance you want to check. If the instance has a backup plan, this command will return information about the backup job. If the instance does not have a backup plan, this command will return an error.

4. Automate the process: If you have a large number of EC2 instances, it might be more efficient to automate this process using a Python script. You can use the `boto3` library to interact with AWS services. The script would first use the `describe_instances` method to get a list of all EC2 instances, and then use the `describe_backup_job` method for each instance to check if it has a backup plan.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing your Python script, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3` in your terminal.

2. Import the necessary libraries and set up AWS credentials: In your Python script, you'll need to import the Boto3 library and set up your AWS credentials. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```python
import boto3

aws_access_key_id = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'
aws_secret_access_key = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
region_name = 'us-west-2'

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id,
    aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key,
    region_name=region_name
)
```

3. Connect to the EC2 service and retrieve all instances: Now that you've set up your AWS credentials, you can connect to the EC2 service and retrieve all instances. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```python
ec2 = session.resource('ec2')

instances = ec2.instances.all()
```

4. Check each instance for a backup plan: Finally, you can iterate over each instance and check if it has a backup plan. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```python
for instance in instances:
    tags = {tag['Key']: tag['Value'] for tag in instance.tags or []}
    if 'Backup' not in tags:
        print(f"Instance {instance.id} does not have a backup plan.")
```

This script will print out the ID of each instance that does not have a backup plan. Note that this script assumes that instances with a backup plan have a tag with the key 'Backup'. If your organization uses a different method to indicate that an instance has a backup plan, you'll need to modify this script accordingly.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of EC2 instances not having a backup plan in AWS, you can set up automated backups using Amazon EBS snapshots. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console:**
   Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to the AWS Management Console using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard:**
   Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page, select "EC2" under the "Compute" section to go to the EC2 Dashboard.

3. **Select the EC2 Instance:**
   In the EC2 Dashboard, select the EC2 instance for which you want to set up automated backups.

4. **Create an Amazon EBS Snapshot:**
   - Select the EBS volume attached to the EC2 instance.
   - Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu, navigate to "Create snapshot" and click on it.
   - Enter a descriptive name for the snapshot and click on "Create snapshot".

5. **Set up Automated Backups:**
   - In the EC2 Dashboard, under the "ELASTIC BLOCK STORE" section, click on "Snapshots".
   - Select the snapshot that you created in the previous step.
   - Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Create Lifecycle Policy".
   - Enter a name for the policy, set the frequency and retention period for backups, and click on "Create policy".

6. **Monitor Backup Status:**
   - To monitor the backup status, go to the EC2 Dashboard, click on "Instances" in the navigation pane, and select the EC2 instance.
   - Under the "Description" tab, you can view the details of the automated backups and their status.

By following these steps, you have successfully set up automated backups for your EC2 instance using Amazon EBS snapshots, ensuring that you have a backup plan in place for protection.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of EC2 instances not having backup plan protection in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify EC2 Instances**: First, you need to identify the EC2 instances that do not have backup plan protection enabled. You can use the following AWS CLI command to list all EC2 instances in your account:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,State.Name,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value]' --output table
   ```

2. **Enable Backup Plan Protection**: To enable backup plan protection for EC2 instances, you can create a backup plan using AWS Backup service. Here's an example command to create a backup plan:
   ```
   aws backup create-backup-plan --backup-plan '{"BackupPlanName": "MyBackupPlan","BackupPlanRule": {"RuleName": "DefaultRule","TargetBackupVaultName": "MyBackupVault","ScheduleExpression": "cron(0 0 ? * SUN *)","StartWindowMinutes": 60,"CompletionWindowMinutes": 10080,"Lifecycle":{"DeleteAfterDays": 30}}}'
   ```

3. **Assign Backup Plan to EC2 Instances**: Next, you need to assign the backup plan to the EC2 instances. You can use the following AWS CLI command to assign the backup plan to the EC2 instances:
   ```
   aws backup start-restore-job --resource-type EC2_INSTANCE --metadata '{"instanceId": "YOUR_INSTANCE_ID"}' --iam-role-arn "YOUR_IAM_ROLE_ARN" --backup-vault-name "YOUR_BACKUP_VAULT_NAME"
   ```

4. **Verify Backup Plan Protection**: Finally, you should verify that the backup plan protection has been successfully enabled for the EC2 instances. You can check the backup status using the AWS Backup console or the following AWS CLI command:
   ```
   aws backup list-recovery-points-by-backup-vault --backup-vault-name "YOUR_BACKUP_VAULT_NAME"
   ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of EC2 instances not having backup plan protection enabled in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of EC2 instances not having a backup plan protection in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify EC2 Instances**: Use the Boto3 library in Python to list all the EC2 instances in your AWS account.

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.describe_instances()
instances = [instance['InstanceId'] for reservation in response['Reservations'] for instance in reservation['Instances']]
```

2. **Create AMI Backups**: For each identified EC2 instance, create an AMI backup. This will serve as a snapshot of the instance that can be used to restore it if needed.

```python
for instance_id in instances:
    response = ec2.create_image(InstanceId=instance_id, Name='Backup-{}'.format(instance_id), NoReboot=True)
    image_id = response['ImageId']
    print('Created AMI {} for instance {}'.format(image_id, instance_id))
```

3. **Set Up Lifecycle Policies**: Configure lifecycle policies to manage the retention of your AMIs to avoid unnecessary costs and clutter. You can do this using the `create_lifecycle_policy` method in Boto3.

```python
lifecycle_policy = {
    'Description': 'AMI Backup Lifecycle Policy',
    'State': 'ENABLED',
    'PolicyDetails': {
        'ResourceTypes': ['AMI'],
        'TargetTags': [{'Key': 'Backup', 'Value': 'True'}],
        'Schedules': [
            {
                'Name': 'DailyBackup',
                'CopyTags': True,
                'CreateRule': {
                    'Interval': 1,
                    'IntervalUnit': 'DAYS',
                    'Times': ['00:00']
                },
                'RetainRule': {
                    'Count': 7
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}

response = ec2.create_lifecycle_policy(LifecyclePolicy=lifecycle_policy)
policy_id = response['PolicyId']
print('Created Lifecycle Policy {}'.format(policy_id))
```

4. **Automate Backup Process**: Set up a cron job or a Lambda function to automate the backup process at regular intervals.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your EC2 instances have a backup plan protection in place in AWS using Python.
