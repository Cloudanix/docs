How to update security group inbound configuration to restrict PostgreSQL Database access to specific entities?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. Click on the Security Groups option in the left-hand menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Unrestricted PostgreSQL Access Should Not Be Allowed" Policy.)
3. Select the security group that is associated with your PostgreSQL database instance.
4. Click on the Inbound Rules tab.
5. Locate the rule that allows access to port 5432. It should have a source of 0.0.0.0/0, which means that it is open to the entire internet.
6. Click on the Edit button to modify the rule.
7. Change the source to the specific entities that need access to the database. This can be done by specifying their IP addresses or the CIDR blocks that they belong to.
8. Click on the Save button to apply the changes.
9. Verify that the new rule is in effect by attempting to access the database from a source that is not allowed. The connection should be refused.
