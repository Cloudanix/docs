### Remediation

How to remediate overutilized EC2 instances.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify Overutilized EC2 Instances:
   - Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
   - From the left navigation pane, click on "Instances" under the "Instances" section.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "EC2 Instances Should Not Be Overutilized" Policy.)
   - Review the list of existing EC2 instances and identify instances that are consistently experiencing high CPU or network utilization.
2. Analyze the Utilization:
   - Select the overutilized EC2 instance.
   - Click on the "Monitoring" tab to view the CPU and network utilization graphs over time.
   - Analyze the utilization patterns to determine the cause of overutilization, such as high traffic or resource-intensive applications.
3. Implement Remediation Measures:
   - Option 1: Scale Up:
     - Increase the instance type or size of the overutilized EC2 instance to provide more resources.
     - Stop the instance if it's EBS-backed, modify the instance type, and then start the instance again.
   - Option 2: Scale Out:
     - If the overutilization is due to high traffic or workload, consider distributing the workload across multiple instances using Auto Scaling or load balancers.
     - Create an Auto Scaling group with appropriate scaling policies to automatically add more instances when utilization exceeds a threshold.
   - Option 3: Optimize Applications:
     - Analyze the applications running on the overutilized instance and optimize them for better performance and resource utilization.
     - Optimize database queries, improve caching mechanisms, or identify and resolve any performance bottlenecks.
4. Monitor and Validate:
   - After implementing the remediation measures, monitor the performance and utilization of the EC2 instances to ensure that the overutilization is resolved.
   - Review monitoring metrics, logs, and performance tests to validate the effectiveness of the remediation measures.
