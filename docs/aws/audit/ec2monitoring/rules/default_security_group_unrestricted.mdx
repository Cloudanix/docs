How to remediate if Default Security group allows unrestricted traffic?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
2. From the left navigation pane, click on "Security Groups" to view the list of security groups.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Default Security Group Should Not Allow Unrestricted Public Traffic" Policy.)
3. Locate the Default Security Group and select it by clicking on its name.
4. In the "Inbound Rules" tab, review the list of inbound rules that allow unrestricted traffic (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0).
5. Identify the rules that you want to modify or remove to restrict the traffic. Consider the principle of least privilege and allow only the necessary inbound traffic for your resources.
6. To modify an existing rule, select the rule by clicking on the corresponding row.
7. Click on the "Actions" button above the rule list and choose "Edit Rule".
8. Modify the rule to restrict the traffic based on your requirements. For example, you can specify a specific IP range or a more specific CIDR block.
9. Click on the "Save Rules" button to apply the changes to the security group.
10. To remove an existing rule that allows unrestricted traffic, select the rule by clicking on the corresponding row.
11. Click on the "Actions" button above the rule list and choose "Delete Rule" or "Remove".
12. Confirm the removal of the rule when prompted.
13. Repeat steps 6 to 12 for each rule that needs modification or removal to restrict the traffic.
14. If necessary, repeat the above steps for the outbound rules in the Default Security Group to ensure that outbound traffic is also appropriately restricted.
