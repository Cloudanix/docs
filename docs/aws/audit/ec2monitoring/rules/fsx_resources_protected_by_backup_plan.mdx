### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of FSx not having a backup plan for AWS EC2 using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to the AWS Management Console using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to Amazon FSx service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the console, then select "FSx" under the "Storage" category.

3. **Select the FSx file system**: In the FSx console, select the FSx file system that you want to create a backup plan for by clicking on its name.

4. **Create a Backup Plan**:
   - In the left-hand navigation pane, click on "Backup" and then click on the "Backup plans" tab.
   - Click on the "Create backup plan" button.
   - Enter a name for the backup plan and configure the backup settings according to your requirements. This includes defining the backup frequency, retention period, and any lifecycle policies.
   - Review the backup plan settings and click on the "Create" button to create the backup plan.

5. **Assign the Backup Plan to the FSx file system**:
   - After creating the backup plan, go back to the FSx file system details page.
   - Click on the "Backup" tab and then click on the "Associate backup plan" button.
   - Select the backup plan that you just created from the dropdown menu and click on the "Associate" button to assign the backup plan to the FSx file system.

6. **Verify Backup Plan**:
   - Once the backup plan is associated with the FSx file system, verify that the backup plan is active and running as expected.
   - Monitor the backup status and ensure that backups are being taken according to the defined schedule.

By following these steps, you will successfully remediate the misconfiguration of FSx not having a backup plan for your AWS EC2 instances using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of not having a backup plan for FSx on AWS EC2 using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI:**
   If you haven't already installed and configured the AWS CLI, you can do so by following the instructions provided in the AWS documentation: [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).

2. **Enable Backup for FSx File Systems:**
   You can enable backup for your FSx file systems using the AWS CLI by running the following command:
   ```
   aws fsx update-file-system --file-system-id fs-1234567890abcdef0 --backup-id backup-0abcdef1234567890 --windows-configuration AutomaticBackupRetentionDays=30,ThroughputCapacity=8
   ```
   Replace `fs-1234567890abcdef0` with the ID of your FSx file system and `backup-0abcdef1234567890` with the ID of the backup you want to associate with the file system. You can adjust the `AutomaticBackupRetentionDays` and `ThroughputCapacity` values as needed.

3. **Verify Backup Configuration:**
   To ensure that backup has been successfully enabled for your FSx file system, you can run the following command:
   ```
   aws fsx describe-file-systems --file-system-ids fs-1234567890abcdef0
   ```
   This command will provide detailed information about your FSx file system, including its backup configuration.

4. **Automate Backup Scheduling (Optional):**
   If you want to automate the scheduling of backups for your FSx file system, you can create a backup policy using the AWS CLI. Here is an example command to create a backup policy:
   ```
   aws fsx create-backup-policy --file-system-id fs-1234567890abcdef0 --daily-backup-start-time 01:00:00 --automatic-backup-retention-days 30
   ```
   This command will create a backup policy for the specified file system that triggers a daily backup at 01:00:00 UTC and retains the backups for 30 days.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not having a backup plan for FSx on AWS EC2 using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of not having a backup plan for FSx in AWS, you can create a backup plan using Python Boto3 library. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this issue:

1. Install Boto3 library:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials:
   Ensure that you have configured your AWS credentials either by setting environment variables or using AWS CLI `aws configure` command.

3. Use the following Python script to create a backup plan for FSx in AWS EC2:

```python
import boto3

def create_fsx_backup_plan(fsx_id, backup_name):
    client = boto3.client('fsx')

    response = client.create_backup_plan(
        ClientRequestToken='string',
        Name=backup_name,
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'Name',
                'Value': backup_name
            },
        ],
        BackupPlan={
            'BackupPlanName': backup_name,
            'BackupPlanRules': [
                {
                    'RuleName': 'DailyBackup',
                    'ScheduleExpression': 'cron(0 0 * * ? *)',
                    'TargetBackupVault': 'string',
                    'StartWindowMinutes': 60,
                    'CompletionWindowMinutes': 60,
                    'Lifecycle': {
                        'DeleteAfterDays': 30
                    },
                    'CopyActions': [
                        {
                            'DestinationBackupVault': 'string'
                        },
                    ]
                },
            ]
        }
    )

    print("Backup plan created successfully with BackupPlanId:", response['BackupPlanId'])

# Replace 'fsx_id' with your FSx file system ID and 'backup_name' with the desired backup plan name
create_fsx_backup_plan('fs-1234567890abcdef0', 'MyBackupPlan')
```

4. Replace `'fsx_id'` with the FSx file system ID for which you want to create a backup plan, and `'backup_name'` with the desired name for the backup plan.

5. Run the Python script to create the backup plan for the specified FSx file system.

By following these steps and executing the Python script, you will be able to create a backup plan for FSx in AWS EC2, thereby remediating the misconfiguration of not having a backup plan.
