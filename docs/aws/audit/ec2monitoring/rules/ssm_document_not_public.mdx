1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Systems Manager home page.

2. In the navigation pane, choose Documents under Shared Resources.

3. In the list of documents, select the document you want to check.

4. In the document details page, check the "Owner" and "Shared with" fields. If the "Owner" is not your account or "Shared with" is set to "Public", then the SSM document is public.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all SSM Documents: Use the AWS CLI command `aws ssm list-documents` to list all the SSM documents in your AWS account. The command will return a JSON object with details about each SSM document.

   ```
   aws ssm list-documents
   ```
3. Check the permissions of each SSM Document: For each SSM document, you can use the `aws ssm describe-document-permission` command to check its permissions. You need to provide the name of the SSM document as a parameter.

   ```
   aws ssm describe-document-permission --name "document-name"
   ```
   This command will return a JSON object with the permissions of the specified SSM document.

4. Identify public SSM Documents: If the `describe-document-permission` command returns a permission type of "Share" and the account IDs include "*", this indicates that the SSM document is public. You can use a script to automate this process and identify all public SSM documents.

   Here is a simple Python script that uses the AWS SDK (boto3) to do this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   ssm = boto3.client('ssm')

   response = ssm.list_documents()

   for document in response['DocumentIdentifiers']:
       permissions = ssm.describe_document_permission(
           Name=document['Name'],
           PermissionType='Share'
       )
       if '*' in permissions['AccountIdsToShare']:
           print(f"Document {document['Name']} is public")
   ```
   This script lists all SSM documents, checks their permissions, and prints the names of the documents that are public.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To detect if an SSM Document is public in EC2 using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the Boto3 library in Python:**

    Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

    ```python
    pip install boto3
    ```

2. **Create an AWS session using Boto3:**

    You need to create a session using your AWS credentials. You can configure your credentials in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI tool. Here is an example:

    ```python
    import boto3

    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
        aws_session_token='SESSION_TOKEN',
    )
    ```

3. **Get the list of all SSM documents:**

    Use the `describe_document_permission` method to get the list of all SSM documents and their permissions. This method returns all the SSM documents along with their permissions (Share, Private, Public).

    ```python
    ssm = session.client('ssm')
    response = ssm.describe_document_permission(
        Name='string',
        PermissionType='Share'
    )
    ```

4. **Check if the SSM document is public:**

    Iterate over the response from the previous step and check if any SSM document has the permission type as 'Public'. If it does, then the SSM document is public.

    ```python
    for document in response['DocumentPermissions']:
        if document['PermissionType'] == 'Public':
            print(f"SSM Document {document['Name']} is public")
    ```

This script will print the names of all the SSM documents that are public.

To remediate the misconfiguration of having an SSM Document public for AWS EC2 instances using Python, you can follow these steps:

    # Remove the "All" option from the document permissions
    response = ssm_client.modify_document_permission(
        Name=document_name,
        PermissionType='Share',
        AccountIds=[],
        SharedDocumentVersion=None
    )
    print(f"Permissions updated for SSM document '{document_name}'.")

def main():
    # Specify the name of the SSM document to remediate
    document_name = 'your-ssm-document-name'

    # Remediate SSM document permissions
    remediate_ssm_document_permission(document_name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Replace `'your-ssm-document-name'` with the name of the SSM document you want to remediate. This script removes the "All" option from the document permissions to ensure it is not shared with all accounts. Adjust the script as needed to fit your environment and document permissions.

To remediate the misconfiguration of not having a backup plan for FSx in AWS, you can create a backup plan using Python Boto3 library. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this issue:

1. Install Boto3 library:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials:
   Ensure that you have configured your AWS credentials either by setting environment variables or using AWS CLI `aws configure` command.

3. Use the following Python script to create a backup plan for FSx in AWS EC2:

```python
import boto3

def remediate_efs_resources_backup_plan(file_system_arns, backup_vault_name):
    # Initialize AWS Backup client
    backup_client = boto3.client('backup')

    # Create a backup plan for the specified EFS file systems
    response = backup_client.create_backup_plan(
        BackupPlan={
            'BackupPlanName': 'YourBackupPlanName',
            'BackupPlanRule': {
                'RuleName': 'DefaultRule',
                'TargetBackupVaultName': backup_vault_name,
                'ScheduleExpression': 'cron(0 0 * * ? *)',  # Example: Daily backup at midnight
                'StartWindowMinutes': 60,
                'CompletionWindowMinutes': 60,
            },
            'AdvancedBackupSettings': [
                {
                    'BackupOptions': {
                        'WindowsVSS': False,
                        'BackupMode': 'FULL',
                        'FileSystemLifecycle': 'SYSTEM'
                    },
                    'ResourceType': 'EFS'
                }
            ]
        }
    )

    print("Backup plan created successfully.")

def main():
    # Specify the ARNs of the EFS file systems to protect
    file_system_arns = ['your-file-system-arn1', 'your-file-system-arn2']

    # Specify the name of the backup vault
    backup_vault_name = 'your-backup-vault-name'

    # Remediate EFS resources by creating a backup plan
    remediate_efs_resources_backup_plan(file_system_arns, backup_vault_name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Replace `'your-file-system-arn1', 'your-file-system-arn2'` with the ARNs of the EFS file systems you want to protect, and `'your-backup-vault-name'` with the name of the backup vault where backups will be stored. This script creates a backup plan for the specified EFS file systems, ensuring they are protected by backups according to the specified schedule and retention policy. Adjust the backup plan settings as needed.
