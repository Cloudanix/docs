To remediate the misconfiguration of having an SSM Document public for AWS EC2 instances using Python, you can follow these steps:

    # Remove the "All" option from the document permissions
    response = ssm_client.modify_document_permission(
        Name=document_name,
        PermissionType='Share',
        AccountIds=[],
        SharedDocumentVersion=None
    )
    print(f"Permissions updated for SSM document '{document_name}'.")

def main():
    # Specify the name of the SSM document to remediate
    document_name = 'your-ssm-document-name'

    # Remediate SSM document permissions
    remediate_ssm_document_permission(document_name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Replace `'your-ssm-document-name'` with the name of the SSM document you want to remediate. This script removes the "All" option from the document permissions to ensure it is not shared with all accounts. Adjust the script as needed to fit your environment and document permissions.

To remediate the misconfiguration of not having a backup plan for FSx on AWS EC2 using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI:**
   If you haven't already installed and configured the AWS CLI, you can do so by following the instructions provided in the AWS documentation: [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).

2. **Enable Backup for FSx File Systems:**
   You can enable backup for your FSx file systems using the AWS CLI by running the following command:
   ```
   aws fsx update-file-system --file-system-id fs-1234567890abcdef0 --backup-id backup-0abcdef1234567890 --windows-configuration AutomaticBackupRetentionDays=30,ThroughputCapacity=8
   ```
   Replace `fs-1234567890abcdef0` with the ID of your FSx file system and `backup-0abcdef1234567890` with the ID of the backup you want to associate with the file system. You can adjust the `AutomaticBackupRetentionDays` and `ThroughputCapacity` values as needed.

3. **Verify Backup Configuration:**
   To ensure that backup has been successfully enabled for your FSx file system, you can run the following command:
   ```
   aws fsx describe-file-systems --file-system-ids fs-1234567890abcdef0
   ```
   This command will provide detailed information about your FSx file system, including its backup configuration.

4. **Automate Backup Scheduling (Optional):**
   If you want to automate the scheduling of backups for your FSx file system, you can create a backup policy using the AWS CLI. Here is an example command to create a backup policy:
   ```
   aws fsx create-backup-policy --file-system-id fs-1234567890abcdef0 --daily-backup-start-time 01:00:00 --automatic-backup-retention-days 30
   ```
   This command will create a backup policy for the specified file system that triggers a daily backup at 01:00:00 UTC and retains the backups for 30 days.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not having a backup plan for FSx on AWS EC2 using the AWS CLI.

```python
import boto3

def remediate_efs_resources_backup_plan(file_system_arns, backup_vault_name):
    # Initialize AWS Backup client
    backup_client = boto3.client('backup')

    # Create a backup plan for the specified EFS file systems
    response = backup_client.create_backup_plan(
        BackupPlan={
            'BackupPlanName': 'YourBackupPlanName',
            'BackupPlanRule': {
                'RuleName': 'DefaultRule',
                'TargetBackupVaultName': backup_vault_name,
                'ScheduleExpression': 'cron(0 0 * * ? *)',  # Example: Daily backup at midnight
                'StartWindowMinutes': 60,
                'CompletionWindowMinutes': 60,
            },
            'AdvancedBackupSettings': [
                {
                    'BackupOptions': {
                        'WindowsVSS': False,
                        'BackupMode': 'FULL',
                        'FileSystemLifecycle': 'SYSTEM'
                    },
                    'ResourceType': 'EFS'
                }
            ]
        }
    )

    print("Backup plan created successfully.")

def main():
    # Specify the ARNs of the EFS file systems to protect
    file_system_arns = ['your-file-system-arn1', 'your-file-system-arn2']

    # Specify the name of the backup vault
    backup_vault_name = 'your-backup-vault-name'

    # Remediate EFS resources by creating a backup plan
    remediate_efs_resources_backup_plan(file_system_arns, backup_vault_name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Replace `'your-file-system-arn1', 'your-file-system-arn2'` with the ARNs of the EFS file systems you want to protect, and `'your-backup-vault-name'` with the name of the backup vault where backups will be stored. This script creates a backup plan for the specified EFS file systems, ensuring they are protected by backups according to the specified schedule and retention policy. Adjust the backup plan settings as needed.
