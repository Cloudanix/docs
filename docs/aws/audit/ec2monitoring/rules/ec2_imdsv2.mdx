title: Require IMDSv2 For EC2 Instances
---

### More Info:

Ensure that all the Amazon EC2 instances require the use of Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) when requesting instance metadata in order to protect against vulnerabilities that could be used to access the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). IMDSv2 uses session-oriented requests. This allows you to create a session token that defines the session duration, which can be a minimum of 1 second and a maximum of 6 hours. During this duration, you can use the same session token for subsequent metadata requests. After this duration expires, you must create a new session token to use for future requests.

How to enable IMDSv2 for EC2 instances.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the EC2 console and select the instance for which you want to enable IMDSv2.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Require IMDSv2 For EC2 Instances" Policy.)
2. Stop the instance to make changes.
3. Select the instance and choose "Actions" -> "Instance Settings" -> "Modify User Data".
4. Add the following lines to the user data script:
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "instance-id: $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id)" >> /etc/systemd/system.conf
echo "instance-type: $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-type)" >> /etc/systemd/system.conf
echo 'NOZEROCONF=yes' >> /etc/sysconfig/network
echo '127.0.0.1 $(hostname)' >> /etc/hosts
systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service
```
5. Start the instance and wait for it to boot up.
6. Connect to the instance using SSH or RDP.
7. Open the terminal and run the following command to check if IMDSv2 is enabled:
```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id -H 'X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 60'
```
If you get a response, IMDSv2 is enabled. If not, check the user data script for errors and try again.
