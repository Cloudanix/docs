1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Events" under "INSTANCES" section.

3. In the "Events" page, you can see the list of all events related to your EC2 instances. You can filter the events by instance ID, event type, status, and date.

4. If there are any scheduled events for your EC2 instances, they will be listed here with details like event type, status, instance ID, and description. You can click on the instance ID to go to the instance details page for more information.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "describe-instance-status" command to check the status of your EC2 instances. This command returns information about the status of your instances, including any scheduled events. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instance-status --include-all-instances
   ```

3. To filter out the instances with scheduled events, you can use the "query" option with the "describe-instance-status" command. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instance-status --query 'InstanceStatuses[?Events!=`null`].{ID:InstanceId,Events:Events}' --output table
   ```

4. If there are any scheduled events, the output of the above command will display the instance ID and the details of the scheduled events. If there are no scheduled events, the command will not return any output.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the Boto3 library. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials: Before you can interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a file at ~/.aws/credentials. Inside this file, you should include your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key:

   ```bash
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Create a Python script: Now you can create a Python script that uses the Boto3 library to check for scheduled events. Here's a simple script that does this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_scheduled_events():
       ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
       response = ec2.describe_instance_status(IncludeAllInstances=True)
       for instance in response['InstanceStatuses']:
           if 'Events' in instance and instance['Events']:
               for event in instance['Events']:
                   print(f"Instance {instance['InstanceId']} has a scheduled event: {event['Code']} at {event['NotBefore']}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_scheduled_events()
   ```

4. Run the script: You can run the script from the command line using the Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python check_scheduled_events.py
   ```

This script will print out any instances that have scheduled events, along with the type of event and the time it is scheduled to occur.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
The following are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the "Scheduled Events for EC2 Instances" misconfiguration in AWS:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Click on the "Instances" link in the left-hand navigation pane.
4. Select the instance(s) that have scheduled events.
5. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Instance Settings" from the dropdown menu.
6. Click on "Modify Scheduled Events".
7. In the "Modify Scheduled Events" dialog box, select the scheduled event(s) that you want to modify or delete.
8. To modify the event, update the details as desired and click "Save". To delete the event, click "Delete".
9. Repeat steps 4-8 for any additional instances that have scheduled events.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the "Scheduled Events for EC2 Instances" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console.

Scheduled Events for EC2 Instances is a misconfiguration that occurs when there are scheduled events for EC2 instances that are not required or are outdated. These events can include instance retirement, system maintenance, and other events that can impact the availability of the instance.

To remediate this misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to list all the scheduled events for your EC2 instances:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instance-status --include-all-instances --query 'InstanceStatuses[*].Events[*]'
   ```

3. Identify the scheduled events that are not required or are outdated.

4. To cancel a scheduled event, run the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 cancel-scheduled-instance-termination --instance-id <instance-id> --dry-run
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance for which you want to cancel the scheduled event.

   Note: The `--dry-run` option will simulate the command but will not make any changes. Remove this option to execute the command.

5. To modify the scheduled event, run the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 modify-instance-event-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --instance-event-id <event-id> --not-before <new-time> --dry-run
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance for which you want to modify the scheduled event, `<event-id>` with the ID of the event, and `<new-time>` with the new time for the event.

   Note: The `--dry-run` option will simulate the command but will not make any changes. Remove this option to execute the command.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for all the scheduled events that need to be remediated.

7. Verify that all the scheduled events have been remediated by running the command in step 2 again.

8. Close the AWS CLI.

By following these steps, you can remediate the Scheduled Events for EC2 Instances misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
The following are the step by step instructions to remediate the "Scheduled Events for EC2 Instances" misconfiguration for AWS using Python:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) modules:

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Initialize the EC2 client:

```python
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Retrieve the list of EC2 instances using the `describe_instances()` method:

```python
instances = ec2.describe_instances()
```

4. Loop through each instance and check if it has any scheduled events using the `describe_instance_status()` method:

```python
for instance in instances['Reservations']:
    instance_id = instance['Instances'][0]['InstanceId']
    try:
        response = ec2.describe_instance_status(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
        if 'ScheduledEvents' in response['InstanceStatuses'][0]:
            # There are scheduled events for this instance
            print(f"Scheduled events found for instance {instance_id}")
            # Remediate the scheduled events by stopping the instance
            ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
            print(f"Instance {instance_id} stopped successfully")
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error retrieving instance status for {instance_id}: {e}")
```

5. If the instance has any scheduled events, stop the instance using the `stop_instances()` method.

6. Verify that the instance has been stopped successfully.

Note: This code will stop the instance to remediate the scheduled events. You can modify it to suit your specific requirements.
