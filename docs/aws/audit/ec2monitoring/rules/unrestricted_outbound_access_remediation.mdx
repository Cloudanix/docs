How to update EC2 security groups outbound configuration in order to restrict access to specific destinations?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the EC2 service by selecting "EC2" from the services menu.
3. In the EC2 dashboard, click on "Security Groups" in the left navigation pane.

4. Identify the security group(s) that have unrestricted outbound access.
5. Take note of the specific security group identifier(s) that need remediation.

7. Above the list of security groups, click on the "Actions" button.
8. In the dropdown menu, click on "Edit outbound rules".
9. In the outbound rule editor, review the existing rules to identify any rules that allow unrestricted access (e.g., rules with "0.0.0.0/0" as the destination IP or port range).
10. Select the rule(s) that allow unrestricted outbound access and click on the "Delete" or "Remove" button to remove the rule(s).
11. Review the remaining outbound rules to ensure that only necessary and secure outbound traffic is allowed.
12. Click on the "Save rules" or "Save" button to apply the changes to the security group.
