### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "Images", click on "AMIs". This will display a list of all available AMIs.
3. Select the AMI you want to check for encryption. In the "Description" tab at the bottom of the page, look for the "Root device" field. Click on the value next to it (e.g., /dev/sda1).
4. A pop-up window will appear with details about the root device. Look for the "EBS ID" field and click on the value next to it. This will redirect you to the EBS dashboard, specifically to the details page of the selected EBS volume.
5. In the "Description" tab of the EBS volume, look for the "KMS key" field. If this field is not empty, it means that the EBS volume (and therefore the AMI) is encrypted. If the field is empty, the AMI is not encrypted.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all AMIs: Use the `describe-images` command to list all the AMIs available in your AWS account. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-images --owners self
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the AMIs.

3. Check encryption status: In the JSON output, look for the `Encrypted` field under `BlockDeviceMappings` > `Ebs`. If the value of `Encrypted` is `false`, then the AMI is not encrypted.

4. Automate the process: You can automate this process by using a Python script. Use the `boto3` library to interact with AWS services. The script will be similar to the CLI commands, where you first list all the AMIs and then check the encryption status of each AMI. If any unencrypted AMI is found, you can print a message or take any other action as per your requirement.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) on your local system. Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3, AWS EC2, and others.

2. Import the necessary modules and establish a session with AWS using your access key and secret access key.

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Create an EC2 resource object using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) that will allow you to interact with your EC2 instances.

```python
ec2_resource = session.resource('ec2')
```

4. Iterate over all your EC2 instances and check if the AMIs used by these instances are encrypted. You can do this by checking the 'Encrypted' attribute of the block device mappings of each instance.

```python
for instance in ec2_resource.instances.all():
    for block_device in instance.block_device_mappings:
        if 'Ebs' in block_device:
            ebs = block_device['Ebs']
            if not ebs['Encrypted']:
                print(f"Instance {instance.id} uses unencrypted AMI {ebs['VolumeId']}")
```

This script will print out the IDs of all instances that are using unencrypted AMIs.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the EC2 AMIs Should Be Encrypted misconfiguration for AWS using AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.

3. In the left-hand navigation panel, click on the "AMIs" option.

4. Select the AMI that needs to be encrypted.

5. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Copy AMI".

6. In the "Copy AMI" wizard, select the region where the AMI will be copied and check the "Encrypt this image" option.

7. Select the KMS key that will be used to encrypt the AMI, or create a new one.

8. Click on the "Copy AMI" button to start the copy process.

9. Once the copy process is complete, the new encrypted AMI will be available in the selected region.

10. Repeat this process for all the unencrypted AMIs in your AWS account.

By following these steps, you can remediate the EC2 AMIs Should Be Encrypted misconfiguration for AWS using AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 AMIs should be encrypted" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance and ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform the remediation steps.

2. List all the AMIs that are not encrypted using the following command:
```
aws ec2 describe-images --filters "Name=block-device-mapping.volume-type,Values=gp2" "Name=state,Values=available" --query 'Images[*].{ID:ImageId,Name:Name,BlockDeviceMappings:BlockDeviceMappings}'
```
This command will list all the unencrypted AMIs in your AWS account.

3. Create a new encrypted copy of the unencrypted AMI using the following command:
```
aws ec2 copy-image --source-image-id ami-xxxxxxxx --source-region us-west-2 --encrypted --region us-west-2
```
Replace the `ami-xxxxxxxx` with the ID of the unencrypted AMI that you want to encrypt.

4. Once the new encrypted AMI is created, deregister the unencrypted AMI using the following command:
```
aws ec2 deregister-image --image-id ami-xxxxxxxx --region us-west-2
```
Replace the `ami-xxxxxxxx` with the ID of the unencrypted AMI that you want to deregister.

5. Verify that the new encrypted AMI is available and working correctly.

6. Repeat the above steps for all unencrypted AMIs in your AWS account.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 AMIs should be encrypted" in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of unencrypted EC2 AMIs in AWS using Python, you can follow the following steps:

1. Import the required AWS SDKs and libraries:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create an EC2 client object:

```python
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Retrieve a list of all the EC2 instances:

```python
instances = ec2.describe_instances()
```

4. Loop through each instance and check if it has any unencrypted AMIs:

```python
for instance in instances['Reservations']:
    for ami in instance['Instances'][0]['BlockDeviceMappings']:
        if not ami.get('Ebs', {}).get('Encrypted', False):
            # If the AMI is not encrypted, remediate it
```

5. To remediate an unencrypted AMI, create a new encrypted copy of it:

```python
response = ec2.create_image(
    InstanceId=instance['Instances'][0]['InstanceId'],
    Name='Encrypted AMI',
    Description='Encrypted copy of the original AMI',
    BlockDeviceMappings=[
        {
            'DeviceName': ami['DeviceName'],
            'Ebs': {
                'SnapshotId': ami['Ebs']['SnapshotId'],
                'VolumeType': ami['Ebs']['VolumeType'],
                'VolumeSize': ami['Ebs']['VolumeSize'],
                'Encrypted': True
            }
        }
    ],
    DryRun=False
)
```

6. Delete the original unencrypted AMI:

```python
response = ec2.deregister_image(
    ImageId=ami['Ebs']['SnapshotId'],
    DryRun=False
)
```

7. Repeat the above steps for each unencrypted AMI found.

Note: Before running the script, make sure that you have the necessary permissions to create and delete EC2 AMIs.
