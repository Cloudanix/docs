1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "Images", click on "AMIs". This will display a list of all available AMIs.
3. Select the AMI you want to check. In the "Description" tab at the bottom of the page, look for the "Root device name". Note down this name.
4. Now, go to the "Elastic Block Store" section in the navigation pane and click on "Snapshots". In the list of snapshots, look for the snapshot that has the same name as the root device name you noted down earlier.
5. Check the "Encryption" column for this snapshot. If it says "Encrypted", then the AMI is encrypted. If it says "Not Encrypted", then the AMI is not encrypted.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all AMIs: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the AMIs available in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-images --owners self
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the AMIs.

3. Check encryption status: In the JSON output, look for the 'Encrypted' field under 'BlockDeviceMappings'. If the value of 'Encrypted' is 'false' or the 'Encrypted' field is missing, then the AMI is not encrypted.

4. Automate the process: To automate this process, you can use a Python script with the Boto3 library (AWS SDK for Python). The script will use the `describe_images` function to get the details of all AMIs and then check the 'Encrypted' field for each AMI. If any unencrypted AMI is found, the script can print a message or take some other action as per your requirements.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3, AWS EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```
After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS credentials. You can do this in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and create an EC2 resource object:

```python
import boto3

# Create an EC2 resource object using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)
ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
```

3. Use the `describe_images` method to retrieve information about all available AMIs:

```python
# Use the 'describe_images' method to retrieve information about all available AMIs
images = ec2.describe_images(Owners=['self'])
```

4. Iterate over the images and check the `Encrypted` attribute:

```python
# Iterate over the images and check the 'Encrypted' attribute
for image in images['Images']:
    if not image['Encrypted']:
        print(f"Image {image['ImageId']} is not encrypted.")
```

This script will print the IDs of all AMIs that are not encrypted. If no output is produced, it means all your AMIs are encrypted.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the EC2 AMIs Should Be Encrypted misconfiguration for AWS using AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.

3. In the left-hand navigation panel, click on the "AMIs" option.

4. Select the AMI that needs to be encrypted.

5. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Copy AMI".

6. In the "Copy AMI" wizard, select the region where the AMI will be copied and check the "Encrypt this image" option.

7. Select the KMS key that will be used to encrypt the AMI, or create a new one.

8. Click on the "Copy AMI" button to start the copy process.

9. Once the copy process is complete, the new encrypted AMI will be available in the selected region.

10. Repeat this process for all the unencrypted AMIs in your AWS account.

By following these steps, you can remediate the EC2 AMIs Should Be Encrypted misconfiguration for AWS using AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 AMIs should be encrypted" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance and ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform the remediation steps.

2. List all the AMIs that are not encrypted using the following command:
```
aws ec2 describe-images --filters "Name=block-device-mapping.volume-type,Values=gp2" "Name=state,Values=available" --query 'Images[*].{ID:ImageId,Name:Name,BlockDeviceMappings:BlockDeviceMappings}'
```
This command will list all the unencrypted AMIs in your AWS account.

3. Create a new encrypted copy of the unencrypted AMI using the following command:
```
aws ec2 copy-image --source-image-id ami-xxxxxxxx --source-region us-west-2 --encrypted --region us-west-2
```
Replace the `ami-xxxxxxxx` with the ID of the unencrypted AMI that you want to encrypt.

4. Once the new encrypted AMI is created, deregister the unencrypted AMI using the following command:
```
aws ec2 deregister-image --image-id ami-xxxxxxxx --region us-west-2
```
Replace the `ami-xxxxxxxx` with the ID of the unencrypted AMI that you want to deregister.

5. Verify that the new encrypted AMI is available and working correctly.

6. Repeat the above steps for all unencrypted AMIs in your AWS account.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 AMIs should be encrypted" in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of unencrypted EC2 AMIs in AWS using Python, you can follow the following steps:

1. Import the required AWS SDKs and libraries:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create an EC2 client object:

```python
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Retrieve a list of all the EC2 instances:

```python
instances = ec2.describe_instances()
```

4. Loop through each instance and check if it has any unencrypted AMIs:

```python
for instance in instances['Reservations']:
    for ami in instance['Instances'][0]['BlockDeviceMappings']:
        if not ami.get('Ebs', {}).get('Encrypted', False):
            # If the AMI is not encrypted, remediate it
```

5. To remediate an unencrypted AMI, create a new encrypted copy of it:

```python
response = ec2.create_image(
    InstanceId=instance['Instances'][0]['InstanceId'],
    Name='Encrypted AMI',
    Description='Encrypted copy of the original AMI',
    BlockDeviceMappings=[
        {
            'DeviceName': ami['DeviceName'],
            'Ebs': {
                'SnapshotId': ami['Ebs']['SnapshotId'],
                'VolumeType': ami['Ebs']['VolumeType'],
                'VolumeSize': ami['Ebs']['VolumeSize'],
                'Encrypted': True
            }
        }
    ],
    DryRun=False
)
```

6. Delete the original unencrypted AMI:

```python
response = ec2.deregister_image(
    ImageId=ami['Ebs']['SnapshotId'],
    DryRun=False
)
```

7. Repeat the above steps for each unencrypted AMI found.

Note: Before running the script, make sure that you have the necessary permissions to create and delete EC2 AMIs.
