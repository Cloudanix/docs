### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard by clicking on "Services" at the top of the console and then selecting "EC2" under the "Compute" category.
3. In the EC2 Dashboard, click on "Instances" in the left-hand navigation pane.
4. Select the instance you want to check. In the bottom pane, under the "Details" tab, look for the "Tenancy" field. This field will show whether the instance is running on shared (default) or dedicated hardware.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 instances: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all your EC2 instances:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with details about all your EC2 instances.

3. Check instance tenancy: In the JSON output, look for the `Placement` field. This field contains information about the tenancy of the instance. If the `Tenancy` field is set to `default`, it means that the instance is running on shared hardware. If it's set to `dedicated`, it means that the instance is running on single-tenant hardware.

4. Use a script to automate the process: If you have many instances and you want to automate the process, you can use a Python script with the boto3 library to get the tenancy of all instances. Here is a simple script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

   for instance in ec2.instances.all():
       print('ID: {}, Tenancy: {}'.format(instance.id, instance.placement['Tenancy']))
   ```

   This script will print the ID and tenancy of all your EC2 instances.

#### Using Python

To check EC2 Instance Tenancy in AWS using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to directly interact with AWS services, including EC2. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Boto3**: First, you need to install the Boto3 library in your Python environment. You can do this using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
2. **Configure AWS Credentials**: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to interact with AWS services. You can configure it using the AWS CLI:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   Then, input your access key, secret access key, and your preferred AWS region when prompted.

3. **Create a Python Script**: Now, you can create a Python script to check the tenancy of your EC2 instances. Here's a simple script that lists all your EC2 instances and their tenancy:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_instances_by_tenancy():
       ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
       for instance in ec2.instances.all():
           print('ID: {}, Tenancy: {}'.format(instance.id, instance.placement['Tenancy']))

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       list_instances_by_tenancy()
   ```
   This script first creates a resource object for EC2. Then, it iterates over all your EC2 instances, printing their ID and tenancy.

4. **Run the Python Script**: Finally, you can run your Python script using the Python interpreter:
   ```
   python your_script.py
   ```
   This will print the ID and tenancy of all your EC2 instances.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

EC2 Instance Tenancy refers to the physical host on which your EC2 instance runs. It can be either a shared tenancy or a dedicated tenancy. If the instance tenancy is set to default, it means that it is running on a shared host. To remediate this misconfiguration, follow the below steps:

1. Login to your AWS console.

2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.

3. Select the EC2 instance for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

4. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Instance Settings".

5. Select "Change Tenancy" from the drop-down menu.

6. Choose the "Dedicated" option and click on "Apply".

7. Review the changes and click on "Confirm".

8. Your instance will be stopped and started again on a dedicated host.

Note: Changing the instance tenancy from default to dedicated may incur additional charges. Please review the pricing details before making the change.

#### Using CLI

The EC2 instance tenancy refers to the type of hardware on which your EC2 instances will run. There are two types of tenancy: shared and dedicated. Shared tenancy means that your instances will run on hardware that is shared with other AWS customers, while dedicated tenancy means that your instances will run on hardware that is dedicated to your account. Here's how to remediate this issue for AWS using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the EC2 instances that are using shared tenancy by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].[InstanceId, InstanceType, Placement.Tenancy]' --output text
```

This command will list all instances along with their tenancy status.

2. Stop the instance(s) that are using shared tenancy by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```

Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance that you want to stop.

3. Modify the instance(s) to use dedicated tenancy by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --attribute instanceTenancy --value dedicated
```

Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance that you want to modify.

4. Start the instance(s) that you stopped in step 2 by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```

Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance that you want to start.

5. Verify that the instance(s) are now using dedicated tenancy by running the command in step 1 again. The Tenancy column should now show "dedicated" for the affected instance(s).

Note: Changing the tenancy of an instance requires stopping and starting the instance, which will result in downtime. You should plan accordingly to minimize the impact on your applications and users.

#### Using Python

The EC2 instance tenancy configuration refers to how the instance is placed on the underlying hardware of the host. There are two types of tenancy - shared and dedicated. Shared tenancy means that the instance is placed on hardware that is shared with other instances, while dedicated tenancy means that the instance is placed on hardware that is dedicated to it.

To remediate this misconfiguration for AWS using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to modify the instance tenancy configuration. Here are the steps:

1. Install boto3 using the following command:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the boto3 library and create an EC2 client object:

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Use the `modify_instance_attribute` method to modify the instance tenancy configuration. You will need to specify the instance ID and the tenancy type that you want to set. For example, to set the tenancy to dedicated, you can use the following code:

```python
response = ec2.modify_instance_attribute(
    InstanceId='your_instance_id',
    Attribute='tenancy',
    Value='dedicated'
)
```

4. Verify that the tenancy configuration has been updated by using the `describe_instances` method to retrieve the instance details:

```python
response = ec2.describe_instances(InstanceIds=['your_instance_id'])
print(response['Reservations'][0]['Instances'][0]['Placement']['Tenancy'])
```

This should return 'dedicated' if the tenancy configuration has been successfully updated.

Note: You will need appropriate permissions to modify the instance tenancy configuration.
