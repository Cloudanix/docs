<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent EC2 Instance Tenancy misconfigurations using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a VPC with Default Tenancy:**
   Ensure that the VPC you are using has the default tenancy. This can be done when creating the VPC.
   ```sh
   aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block <CIDR_BLOCK> --instance-tenancy default
   ```

2. **Launch Instances with Default Tenancy:**
   When launching an EC2 instance, specify the tenancy as default.
   ```sh
   aws ec2 run-instances --image-id <AMI_ID> --count 1 --instance-type <INSTANCE_TYPE> --key-name <KEY_NAME> --subnet-id <SUBNET_ID> --placement Tenancy=default
   ```

3. **Modify Existing VPC to Default Tenancy:**
   If you have an existing VPC with dedicated tenancy, you can modify it to default tenancy.
   ```sh
   aws ec2 modify-vpc-tenancy --vpc-id <VPC_ID> --instance-tenancy default
   ```

4. **Set Up IAM Policies to Enforce Default Tenancy:**
   Create and attach an IAM policy that enforces the use of default tenancy for EC2 instances.
   ```sh
   aws iam create-policy --policy-name EnforceDefaultTenancy --policy-document '{
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Deny",
               "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
               "Resource": "*",
               "Condition": {
                   "StringNotEquals": {
                       "ec2:Tenancy": "default"
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
   }'
   ```

By following these steps, you can prevent EC2 Instance Tenancy misconfigurations using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent EC2 Instance Tenancy misconfigurations using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python, also known as Boto3. Here are the steps to ensure that EC2 instances are launched with the correct tenancy:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already.

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by directly configuring the `~/.aws/credentials` file.

3. **Create a Python Script to Launch EC2 Instances with Default Tenancy**:
   Write a Python script that specifies the tenancy as 'default' when launching EC2 instances. This ensures that instances are not launched with 'dedicated' or 'host' tenancy unless explicitly required.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon EC2
   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   # Define the instance parameters
   instance_params = {
       'ImageId': 'ami-0abcdef1234567890',  # Replace with your desired AMI ID
       'InstanceType': 't2.micro',          # Replace with your desired instance type
       'MinCount': 1,
       'MaxCount': 1,
       'Placement': {
           'Tenancy': 'default'             # Ensure tenancy is set to 'default'
       }
   }

   # Launch the instance
   response = ec2.run_instances(**instance_params)

   # Print the instance ID
   for instance in response['Instances']:
       print(f"Launched instance with ID: {instance['InstanceId']}")
   ```

4. **Validate Tenancy Configuration**:
   After launching the instance, you can validate that the tenancy is set to 'default' by describing the instance and checking its placement attributes.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon EC2
   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   # Replace with your instance ID
   instance_id = 'i-0abcdef1234567890'

   # Describe the instance
   response = ec2.describe_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])

   # Check the tenancy
   for reservation in response['Reservations']:
       for instance in reservation['Instances']:
           tenancy = instance['Placement']['Tenancy']
           print(f"Instance ID: {instance['InstanceId']} has tenancy: {tenancy}")
           if tenancy != 'default':
               print("Warning: Instance tenancy is not set to 'default'.")
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that EC2 instances are launched with the correct tenancy configuration using Python scripts. This helps prevent misconfigurations related to instance tenancy in AWS EC2.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard by clicking on "Services" at the top of the screen and then selecting "EC2" under the "Compute" category.
3. In the EC2 Dashboard, click on "Instances" in the left-hand navigation pane.
4. In the list of instances, select the instance you want to check. The details of the instance will appear in the lower part of the screen.
5. In the "Description" tab, look for the "Tenancy" field. This will show whether the instance is running on shared (default) or dedicated hardware.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can use the AWS CLI, you need to install it on your system. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 instances: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all EC2 instances in your account:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with information about all your EC2 instances.

3. Check instance tenancy: In the JSON output, look for the `Placement` field. This field contains information about the tenancy of the instance. If the `Tenancy` field is set to `default`, the instance is running on shared hardware. If it's set to `dedicated`, the instance is running on single-tenant hardware.

4. Filter instances by tenancy: If you want to filter instances by tenancy, you can use the `--query` option in the `describe-instances` command. For example, the following command will return only instances that are running on dedicated hardware:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[?Placement.Tenancy==`dedicated`]'
   ```

   Similarly, you can replace `dedicated` with `default` to get instances running on shared hardware.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the Boto3 library. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials: Before you can interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a file at ~/.aws/credentials. At the very least, the contents of the file should be:

   ```bash
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Create a Python script: Now, you can create a Python script that uses the Boto3 library to interact with AWS and check the EC2 instance tenancy. Here's a simple script that does this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_ec2_tenancy():
       ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
       instances = ec2.instances.all()

       for instance in instances:
           print(f'Instance ID: {instance.id} Tenancy: {instance.placement["Tenancy"]}')

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       check_ec2_tenancy()
   ```
   This script first creates a connection to the EC2 service. Then it retrieves all instances and for each instance, it prints the instance ID and its tenancy.

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python check_ec2_tenancy.py
   ```
   This will print the instance ID and tenancy of all your EC2 instances.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
EC2 Instance Tenancy refers to the physical host on which your EC2 instance runs. It can be either a shared tenancy or a dedicated tenancy. If the instance tenancy is set to default, it means that it is running on a shared host. To remediate this misconfiguration, follow the below steps:

1. Login to your AWS console.

2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.

3. Select the EC2 instance for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

4. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Instance Settings".

5. Select "Change Tenancy" from the drop-down menu.

6. Choose the "Dedicated" option and click on "Apply".

7. Review the changes and click on "Confirm".

8. Your instance will be stopped and started again on a dedicated host.

Note: Changing the instance tenancy from default to dedicated may incur additional charges. Please review the pricing details before making the change.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The EC2 instance tenancy refers to the type of hardware on which your EC2 instances will run. There are two types of tenancy: shared and dedicated. Shared tenancy means that your instances will run on hardware that is shared with other AWS customers, while dedicated tenancy means that your instances will run on hardware that is dedicated to your account. Here's how to remediate this issue for AWS using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the EC2 instances that are using shared tenancy by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].[InstanceId, InstanceType, Placement.Tenancy]' --output text
```

This command will list all instances along with their tenancy status.

2. Stop the instance(s) that are using shared tenancy by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```

Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance that you want to stop.

3. Modify the instance(s) to use dedicated tenancy by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --attribute instanceTenancy --value dedicated
```

Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance that you want to modify.

4. Start the instance(s) that you stopped in step 2 by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```

Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance that you want to start.

5. Verify that the instance(s) are now using dedicated tenancy by running the command in step 1 again. The Tenancy column should now show "dedicated" for the affected instance(s).

Note: Changing the tenancy of an instance requires stopping and starting the instance, which will result in downtime. You should plan accordingly to minimize the impact on your applications and users.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
The EC2 instance tenancy configuration refers to how the instance is placed on the underlying hardware of the host. There are two types of tenancy - shared and dedicated. Shared tenancy means that the instance is placed on hardware that is shared with other instances, while dedicated tenancy means that the instance is placed on hardware that is dedicated to it.

To remediate this misconfiguration for AWS using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to modify the instance tenancy configuration. Here are the steps:

1. Install boto3 using the following command:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the boto3 library and create an EC2 client object:

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Use the `modify_instance_attribute` method to modify the instance tenancy configuration. You will need to specify the instance ID and the tenancy type that you want to set. For example, to set the tenancy to dedicated, you can use the following code:

```python
response = ec2.modify_instance_attribute(
    InstanceId='your_instance_id',
    Attribute='tenancy',
    Value='dedicated'
)
```

4. Verify that the tenancy configuration has been updated by using the `describe_instances` method to retrieve the instance details:

```python
response = ec2.describe_instances(InstanceIds=['your_instance_id'])
print(response['Reservations'][0]['Instances'][0]['Placement']['Tenancy'])
```

This should return 'dedicated' if the tenancy configuration has been successfully updated.

Note: You will need appropriate permissions to modify the instance tenancy configuration.
