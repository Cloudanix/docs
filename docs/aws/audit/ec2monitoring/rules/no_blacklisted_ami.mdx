### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "Instances", click on "Instances".
3. In the "Instances" page, you will see a list of all your instances. Click on an instance to view its details.
4. In the "Description" tab, look for the "AMI ID". This is the ID of the AMI used to launch the instance. Compare this ID with your list of blacklisted AMIs. If the ID matches any of the blacklisted AMIs, then this instance is using a blacklisted AMI. Repeat this process for all instances.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the EC2 instances in your account using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId]' --output text
   ```

   This command will return a list of all instance IDs.

3. Now, for each instance ID, you can get the AMI ID using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id> --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[ImageId]' --output text
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the actual instance ID. This command will return the AMI ID used by the instance.

4. Finally, you can check if the AMI ID is in your blacklist. This step depends on how you maintain your blacklist. If it's a text file with one AMI ID per line, you can use the following command:

   ```
   grep -Fxq "<ami-id>" blacklist.txt
   ```

   Replace `<ami-id>` with the actual AMI ID. If the command returns nothing, the AMI ID is not in the blacklist. If it returns the AMI ID, the AMI ID is in the blacklist, indicating a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. **Import necessary libraries and establish a session**: To start with, you need to import the necessary libraries in your Python script. Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. 

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```
Then, establish a session using your AWS credentials.

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    aws_session_token='SESSION_TOKEN',
)
```

2. **Get a list of all EC2 instances**: Use the `describe_instances()` function to get a list of all EC2 instances.

```python
ec2 = session.resource('ec2')
instances = ec2.instances.all()
```

3. **Check each instance's AMI against the blacklist**: For each instance, get the AMI ID and check it against your list of blacklisted AMIs. If the AMI ID is in the blacklist, print a message or take other appropriate action.

```python
blacklisted_amis = ['ami-abc123', 'ami-def456', ...]  # replace with your actual blacklisted AMIs

for instance in instances:
    if instance.image_id in blacklisted_amis:
        print(f"Instance {instance.id} is using blacklisted AMI {instance.image_id}")
```

4. **Handle exceptions**: It's a good practice to handle exceptions in your script. For example, you might encounter a `ClientError` if there are issues with your AWS credentials or permissions.

```python
try:
    # your code here
except ClientError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This script will help you identify any EC2 instances that are using blacklisted AMIs. You can then take appropriate action to remediate the issue.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of blacklisted AMIs in AWS using AWS console, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to your AWS console.
2. Go to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Click on the "AMIs" option on the left-hand menu.
4. Identify the blacklisted AMIs from the list of available AMIs.
5. Select the blacklisted AMI that you want to remove.
6. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Deregister" from the drop-down menu.
7. Confirm the action by clicking on the "Deregister" button.
8. Once the AMI is deregistered, it will no longer be available for use.
9. Ensure that any instances using the blacklisted AMI are terminated and replaced with instances using approved AMIs.
10. Implement a process to regularly check and update the list of approved AMIs to prevent the use of blacklisted AMIs in the future.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the issue of blacklisted AMIs in AWS using AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of using blacklisted AMIs in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the blacklisted AMIs in your AWS account. You can check the list of blacklisted AMIs on the AWS website.

2. Find all the instances that are using the blacklisted AMIs. You can use the following AWS CLI command to get the list of instances:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,ImageId]' --output text
```

This command will return a list of all the instances in your AWS account along with their AMI IDs.

3. Stop the instances that are using the blacklisted AMIs. You can use the following AWS CLI command to stop the instances:

```
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <instance-id-1> <instance-id-2> ... <instance-id-n>
```

Replace `<instance-id-1>`, `<instance-id-2>`, and so on with the instance IDs of the instances that are using the blacklisted AMIs.

4. Create a new instance using a non-blacklisted AMI. You can use the following AWS CLI command to launch a new instance:

```
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id <non-blacklisted-ami-id> --count 1 --instance-type <instance-type> --key-name <key-name> --security-group-ids <security-group-id> --subnet-id <subnet-id>
```

Replace `<non-blacklisted-ami-id>` with the ID of a non-blacklisted AMI, `<instance-type>` with the type of instance you want to launch, `<key-name>` with the name of the key pair you want to use to connect to the instance, `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group you want to use, and `<subnet-id>` with the ID of the subnet you want to launch the instance in.

5. Once the new instance is launched, you can transfer any data or configuration from the old instance to the new instance.

6. Finally, terminate the instances that were using the blacklisted AMIs. You can use the following AWS CLI command to terminate the instances:

```
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids <instance-id-1> <instance-id-2> ... <instance-id-n>
```

Replace `<instance-id-1>`, `<instance-id-2>`, and so on with the instance IDs of the instances that were using the blacklisted AMIs.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of using blacklisted AMIs in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Define a list of blacklisted AMIs that you want to avoid using. You can get this list from multiple sources, such as AWS documentation or a security team.

```python
blacklisted_amis = ['ami-0123456789abcdef0', 'ami-0123456789abcdef1', 'ami-0123456789abcdef2']
```

2. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to get a list of all the AMIs available in your AWS account.

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

all_amis = ec2.describe_images(Owners=['self'])['Images']
```

3. Loop through each AMI and check if it is blacklisted. If it is, deregister the AMI and delete its associated snapshots.

```python
for ami in all_amis:
    if ami['ImageId'] in blacklisted_amis:
        ec2.deregister_image(ImageId=ami['ImageId'])
        for block_device_mapping in ami['BlockDeviceMappings']:
            if 'Ebs' in block_device_mapping:
                snapshot_id = block_device_mapping['Ebs']['SnapshotId']
                ec2.delete_snapshot(SnapshotId=snapshot_id)
```

4. Optionally, you can also notify the appropriate team or individual about the remediation action.

```python
import boto3

sns = boto3.client('sns')

topic_arn = 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:Blacklisted_AMIs'

message = 'The following blacklisted AMIs have been deregistered and their associated snapshots have been deleted: {}'.format(blacklisted_amis)

sns.publish(TopicArn=topic_arn, Message=message)
```

Note: Make sure you have appropriate permissions to perform these actions in your AWS account.
