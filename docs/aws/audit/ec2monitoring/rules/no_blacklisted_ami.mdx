How to ensure no black listed AMIs are used

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the list of blacklisted AMIs that you want to restrict in your environment. This list typically includes AMIs that have known security vulnerabilities or are not compliant with your organization's standards.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Blacklisted AMIs Should Not Be Used" Policy.)
2. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
3. From the left navigation pane, click on "Instances" to view the list of EC2 instances.
4. Select each EC2 instance one by one and review the AMI used by the instance.
5. Compare the AMI ID with your blacklist of AMIs to determine if it is blacklisted.
6. If you find an instance using a blacklisted AMI, you have a couple of options:
   a. Terminate the instance: If the instance is not critical and can be replaced easily, you can terminate it and launch a new instance with an allowed AMI.
   b. Change the AMI: If terminating the instance is not feasible, you can change the AMI associated with the instance by performing the following steps:
      - Stop the instance.
      - Create a new AMI that is compliant or allowed in your environment.
      - Modify the instance and select the newly created compliant AMI.
      - Start the instance.
7. Repeat the process for all EC2 instances in your environment to ensure none of them are using blacklisted AMIs.
