### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu, then selecting "EC2" under the "Compute" category.
3. In the EC2 dashboard, select "Instances" from the left-hand menu.
4. In the Instances page, select an instance to inspect. In the "Description" tab at the bottom of the page, look for the "Security groups" field. If there are multiple security groups listed, this instance has multiple security groups. Repeat this step for each instance as necessary.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 instances: Use the following command to list all the EC2 instances in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId]' --output text
   ```

3. Check security groups for each instance: For each instance ID that you get from the above command, you can check the security groups attached to it using the following command.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id> --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].SecurityGroups[*].GroupId' --output text
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the actual instance ID.

4. Detect instances with multiple security groups: If the above command returns more than one security group ID, it means that the instance has multiple security groups attached to it. You can use a script to automate this process and list all instances with multiple security groups.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   First, you need to install Boto3. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3`. After installing Boto3, you need to configure it. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. Import necessary libraries and establish a session:
   In your Python script, you need to import the Boto3 library and establish a session with your AWS account. Here is an example of how you can do this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ec2 = session.resource('ec2')
   ```

3. Retrieve and analyze EC2 instances:
   Now, you can retrieve all the EC2 instances in your account and analyze their security groups. Here is an example of how you can do this:

   ```python
   for instance in ec2.instances.all():
       if len(instance.security_groups) > 1:
           print(f"EC2 instance {instance.id} has multiple security groups.")
   ```

4. Run the script:
   Finally, you can run your Python script. If there are any EC2 instances with multiple security groups, their IDs will be printed out. If there are no such instances, nothing will be printed out.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration of EC2 instances with multiple security groups in AWS:

1. Log into your AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.

2. Select the EC2 instance that has multiple security groups.

3. In the Details tab of the EC2 instance, scroll down to the Security Groups section.

4. Click on the Edit security groups button.

5. A pop-up window will appear showing all the security groups associated with the EC2 instance.

6. Remove all the unnecessary security groups by selecting them and clicking on the Remove button.

7. Click on the Save button to save the changes.

8. Verify that only the required security group is associated with the EC2 instance.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of EC2 instances with multiple security groups in AWS.

#### Using CLI

Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the issue of EC2 instances with multiple security groups in AWS using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the EC2 instances with multiple security groups:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].[InstanceId, SecurityGroups]' --output text | awk '{if (NF>2) print $1}'
```

This command will return a list of EC2 instance IDs that have more than one security group assigned to them.

3. For each instance ID returned by the previous command, run the following command to remove all but one of the security groups:

```
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --groups <security-group-id>
```

Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the EC2 instance and `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group that you want to keep.

4. Repeat step 3 for all the EC2 instances returned by the first command.

5. Finally, run the first command again to verify that all the EC2 instances now have only one security group assigned to them.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the issue of EC2 instances with multiple security groups in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate EC2 instances with multiple security groups in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

Step 1: Import the Boto3 library
```
import boto3
```

Step 2: Create an EC2 client object
```
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

Step 3: Get a list of all EC2 instances
```
instances = ec2.describe_instances()
```

Step 4: Loop through the instances and check if they have multiple security groups
```
for reservation in instances['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        if len(instance['SecurityGroups']) > 1:
            instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
            security_group_ids = [sg['GroupId'] for sg in instance['SecurityGroups']]
```

Step 5: Remove the extra security groups from the instance
```
ec2.modify_instance_attribute(InstanceId=instance_id, Groups=security_group_ids[:1])
```

This will remove all the extra security groups from the instance and leave only the first security group in the list. You can run this script periodically to ensure that all your EC2 instances have only one security group assigned to them.
