### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "RESOURCES", click on "Reserved Instances". This will display a list of all the Reserved Instances.
3. For each Reserved Instance, check the "State" column. If the state is "active", it means the Reserved Instance is currently in use. If the state is "retired" or "expired", it means the Reserved Instance is not in use.
4. Additionally, check the "Instance Count" column. If the count is 0, it means the Reserved Instance is not being used.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all Reserved Instances: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all your Reserved Instances:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --filters Name=state,Values=active
   ```
   This command will return a list of all active Reserved Instances in your AWS account.

3. List all Running Instances: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all your running EC2 instances:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --filters Name=instance-state-name,Values=running
   ```
   This command will return a list of all running EC2 instances in your AWS account.

4. Compare the lists: Now, you need to compare the list of Reserved Instances with the list of running instances. If there are any Reserved Instances that are not in the list of running instances, those are unused Reserved Instances. You can do this comparison manually or write a script to do it. If you're writing a script, you would extract the instance IDs from the output of the above commands and compare them.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) on your local system. Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3, AWS EC2, and more.

2. Import the necessary modules and establish a session with AWS using your access key and secret access key.

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Use the `describe_reserved_instances` method from the EC2 client to get details about the reserved instances. Filter the instances where the state is 'active' but the instance count is 0, which means the reserved instance is not being used.

```python
ec2 = session.client('ec2')

response = ec2.describe_reserved_instances(
    Filters=[
        {
            'Name': 'state',
            'Values': [
                'active',
            ]
        },
    ]
)

unused_reserved_instances = [ri for ri in response['ReservedInstances'] if ri['InstanceCount'] == 0]
```

4. Print the unused reserved instances to the console. If the list is empty, it means all reserved instances are being used. If not, the printed instances are the unused ones.

```python
if not unused_reserved_instances:
    print("All reserved instances are being used.")
else:
    print("Unused reserved instances:")
    for ri in unused_reserved_instances:
        print(f"ID: {ri['ReservedInstancesId']}, Offering Type: {ri['OfferingType']}")
```

This script will help you identify any unused reserved instances in your AWS EC2. Make sure to replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'` and `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'` with your actual AWS access key and secret access key.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of unused reserved instances in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
3. Click on the "Reserved Instances" option from the left-hand menu.
4. Identify the unused reserved instances that need to be remediated.
5. Select the unused reserved instances that you want to modify.
6. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Modify Reserved Instances".
7. In the "Modify Reserved Instances" window, select the "Apply to" option and choose the instances that you want to apply the reserved instances to.
8. Click on the "Add to queue" button to add the modification to the queue.
9. Review the changes and click on the "Modify Reserved Instances" button to apply the changes.

Once the changes are applied, the unused reserved instances will be applied to the selected instances, and the misconfiguration of unused reserved instances will be remediated.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of unused reserved instances in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the unused reserved instances by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --filters "Name=state,Values=active" "Name=instance-state-name,Values=stopped" --query "ReservedInstances[].{ID:ReservedInstancesId,Type:InstanceType,State:State,Count:InstanceCount,Start:Start,End:End}" --output table
   ```
   
   This command will list all the reserved instances that are in active state but not being used.

2. Once you have identified the unused reserved instances, you can either modify or delete them.

   To modify the unused reserved instances, you can change the instance type or the availability zone to match your current usage. To modify a reserved instance, run the following command:
   
   ```
   aws ec2 modify-reserved-instances --reserved-instances-id <reservation-id> --target-configuration InstanceCount=<new-count>,InstanceType=<new-type>,AvailabilityZone=<new-zone>
   ```
   
   Replace `<reservation-id>` with the ID of the unused reserved instance, `<new-count>` with the number of instances you want to reserve, `<new-type>` with the instance type you want to reserve, and `<new-zone>` with the availability zone you want to reserve the instance in.
   
   To delete the unused reserved instances, run the following command:
   
   ```
   aws ec2 cancel-reserved-instances-merchandise --reserved-instances-id <reservation-id>
   ```
   
   Replace `<reservation-id>` with the ID of the unused reserved instance you want to delete.
   
3. Verify that the unused reserved instances have been modified or deleted by running the command in step 1 again.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Reserved Instances Should Not Be Unused" in AWS using python, follow these steps:

1. Identify the unused reserved instances in your AWS account. You can do this by using the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to list all your reserved instances and their utilization status.

```python
import boto3

# Create an EC2 client
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# List all the reserved instances
reserved_instances = ec2.describe_reserved_instances()

# Identify the unused reserved instances
unused_reserved_instances = []
for ri in reserved_instances['ReservedInstances']:
    if ri['State'] == 'active' and ri['InstanceCount'] > 0 and ri['InstanceCount'] == ri['AvailableInstanceCount']:
        unused_reserved_instances.append(ri['ReservedInstancesId'])
```

2. Once you have identified the unused reserved instances, you can either sell them on the AWS Reserved Instance Marketplace or exchange them for other instances that you need. To sell the unused reserved instances, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to create a listing on the AWS Reserved Instance Marketplace.

```python
import boto3

# Create an EC2 client
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Create a listing for the unused reserved instances
response = ec2.create_reserved_instances_listing(
    ReservedInstancesId='YOUR_RESERVED_INSTANCE_ID',
    InstanceCount=1,
    PriceSchedules=[
        {
            'Term': 12,
            'Price': 1000.0,
            'CurrencyCode': 'USD'
        },
    ],
    ClientToken='YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN'
)
```

3. If you want to exchange the unused reserved instances for other instances, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to modify the reserved instances.

```python
import boto3

# Create an EC2 client
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Modify the unused reserved instances to exchange them for other instances
response = ec2.modify_reserved_instances(
    ReservedInstancesIds=[
        'YOUR_RESERVED_INSTANCE_ID',
    ],
    TargetConfigurations=[
        {
            'AvailabilityZone': 'us-west-2a',
            'InstanceCount': 1,
            'InstanceType': 't2.micro',
            'Platform': 'Linux/UNIX',
            'Scope': 'Availability Zone',
        },
    ]
)
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Reserved Instances Should Not Be Unused" in AWS using python.
