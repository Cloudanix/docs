title: EC2 Classic Should Not Be Used
---

### More Info:

VPC should be used for EC2 instances instead of using EC2 Classic. VPCs are the latest and more secure method of launching AWS resources.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Security, Reliability, Operational Maturity

### Compliance Standards

### Remediation

How to ensure EC2 Classic is not used

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "EC2 Classic Should Not Be Used" Policy.)
2. From the left navigation pane, click on "Instances" to view the list of EC2 instances.
3. Review the instances listed and identify any instances running in the EC2-Classic platform.
4. If you find instances running in EC2-Classic, you have a couple of options:
   a. Migrate instances to EC2-VPC: If the instances are critical and need to remain active, you can migrate them from EC2-Classic to EC2-VPC. The migration process involves creating a new VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and moving the instances to the VPC. Follow the AWS documentation for detailed steps on how to migrate instances from EC2-Classic to EC2-VPC.
   b. Terminate EC2-Classic instances: If the instances are not critical or can be replaced easily, you can terminate them and launch new instances in EC2-VPC. Ensure you have backups of any necessary data before terminating instances.
5. To prevent the launch of new instances in EC2-Classic, you can apply the following measures:
   a. VPC-only subnets: When creating subnets, ensure they are created within a VPC and not in the default EC2-Classic platform.
   b. Security group restrictions: Update security groups to allow traffic only within VPC or between VPCs, and deny traffic from EC2-Classic.
   c. Modify IAM policies: Update IAM policies to restrict the creation and access of resources to VPC only.
