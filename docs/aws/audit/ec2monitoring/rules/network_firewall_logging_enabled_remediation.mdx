<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of "Network Firewall Logging Should Be Enabled in EC2" using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Log Group in CloudWatch Logs:**
   Ensure you have a log group in CloudWatch Logs where the firewall logs will be stored.
   ```sh
   aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name my-firewall-log-group
   ```

2. **Create a Firewall Policy with Logging Configuration:**
   Create a firewall policy that includes logging configuration. This step involves creating a JSON file with the logging configuration and then using it to create the policy.
   ```sh
   cat > firewall-policy.json << EOL
   {
     "StatelessRuleGroupReferences": [],
     "StatefulRuleGroupReferences": [],
     "LoggingConfiguration": {
       "LogDestinationConfigs": [
         {
           "LogType": "FLOW",
           "LogDestination": {
             "LogGroup": "arn:aws:logs:us-west-2:123456789012:log-group:my-firewall-log-group"
           }
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   EOL

   aws network-firewall create-firewall-policy --firewall-policy-name my-firewall-policy --firewall-policy file://firewall-policy.json
   ```

3. **Create a Firewall:**
   Create a firewall using the firewall policy created in the previous step.
   ```sh
   aws network-firewall create-firewall --firewall-name my-firewall --firewall-policy-arn arn:aws:network-firewall:us-west-2:123456789012:firewall-policy/my-firewall-policy --vpc-id vpc-0123456789abcdef0 --subnet-mappings SubnetId=subnet-0123456789abcdef0
   ```

4. **Enable Logging for Existing Firewalls:**
   If you have an existing firewall, you can enable logging by updating the firewall's logging configuration.
   ```sh
   cat > logging-configuration.json << EOL
   {
     "LogDestinationConfigs": [
       {
         "LogType": "FLOW",
         "LogDestination": {
           "LogGroup": "arn:aws:logs:us-west-2:123456789012:log-group:my-firewall-log-group"
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   EOL

   aws network-firewall update-logging-configuration --firewall-arn arn:aws:network-firewall:us-west-2:123456789012:firewall/my-firewall --logging-configuration file://logging-configuration.json
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that network firewall logging is enabled for your EC2 instances using AWS CLI.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose 'Security Groups'.

3. Select the security group that you want to check.

4. In the details pane, choose the 'Inbound Rules' tab to view the inbound rules, and the 'Outbound Rules' tab to view the outbound rules.

5. Check if the logging is enabled for the selected security group. If the 'Logging' column is not visible, you might need to scroll horizontally. If the 'Logging' column shows 'No', then the Network Firewall Logging is not enabled for that security group.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all the security groups: Use the following command to list all the security groups in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query "SecurityGroups[*].{Name:GroupName,ID:GroupId}"
   ```
   This command will return a list of all security groups along with their names and IDs.

3. Check the inbound and outbound rules: For each security group, check the inbound and outbound rules to see if logging is enabled. You can do this by running the following commands:

   For inbound rules:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query 'SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions[*]'
   ```
   For outbound rules:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query 'SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissionsEgress[*]'
   ```
   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group you want to check. These commands will return the inbound and outbound rules for the specified security group.

4. Check for logging: In the output of the previous commands, look for the "log" field. If it is set to "true", then logging is enabled. If it is set to "false" or if the "log" field is not present, then logging is not enabled. Note that AWS EC2 does not natively support firewall logging at the security group level. You would need to use VPC Flow Logs or a third-party solution to achieve this.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3, AWS EC2, and more. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```
Then, configure it with your user credentials.

2. Import the necessary modules and create an EC2 resource object:

```python
import boto3

# Create an EC2 resource object using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)
ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
```

3. Iterate over all the security groups and check if logging is enabled:

```python
# Get all security groups
security_groups = ec2.security_groups.all()

# Iterate over each security group
for group in security_groups:
    # Check if logging is enabled
    if 'LoggingEnabled' not in group.ip_permissions_egress[0]:
        print(f"Logging is not enabled for security group: {group.group_name}")
```

4. The above script will print the names of all security groups where logging is not enabled. If the script doesn't print anything, it means that logging is enabled for all security groups. Please note that this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to list and describe your EC2 security groups. If you don't, you'll need to adjust your IAM policies accordingly.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of network firewall logging not being enabled for AWS EC2 instances using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Enable VPC Flow Logs**: VPC Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Run the following AWS CLI command to enable VPC Flow Logs for your VPC:

```bash
aws ec2 create-flow-logs --resource-type VPC --resource-ids <your-vpc-id> --traffic-type ALL --log-group-name <your-log-group-name> --deliver-logs-permission-arn <your-iam-role-arn>
```

Replace `<your-vpc-id>` with the ID of your VPC, `<your-log-group-name>` with the name of the CloudWatch Logs group where the flow logs will be stored, and `<your-iam-role-arn>` with the ARN of the IAM role that has permission to publish logs to CloudWatch Logs.

2. **Enable Security Group Logging**: Security Group Logs provide detailed information about the traffic allowed or denied by security groups associated with your EC2 instances. Run the following AWS CLI command to enable security group logging:

```bash
aws ec2 create-flow-logs --resource-type NetworkInterface --resource-ids <your-network-interface-id> --traffic-type ALL --log-group-name <your-log-group-name> --deliver-logs-permission-arn <your-iam-role-arn>
```

Replace `<your-network-interface-id>` with the ID of the network interface associated with your EC2 instance.

3. **Verify Configuration**: Once you have enabled VPC Flow Logs and Security Group Logs, verify that the logs are being generated and stored in the specified CloudWatch Logs group. You can do this by checking the CloudWatch Logs console or by using the AWS CLI to query the logs.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of network firewall logging not being enabled for AWS EC2 instances using AWS CLI.
