<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of Termination Protection not being enabled in EC2 using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Instance ID:**
   First, you need to identify the instance ID of the EC2 instance for which you want to enable termination protection. You can list all instances and their IDs using the following command:
   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-instances --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId" --output text
   ```

2. **Enable Termination Protection:**
   Use the `modify-instance-attribute` command to enable termination protection for the specified instance. Replace `<instance-id>` with the actual instance ID.
   ```sh
   aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --disable-api-termination
   ```

3. **Verify Termination Protection Status:**
   To ensure that termination protection has been enabled, you can describe the instance attributes and check the `DisableApiTermination` attribute.
   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --attribute disableApiTermination
   ```

4. **Automate for Multiple Instances (Optional):**
   If you need to enable termination protection for multiple instances, you can use a loop in a shell script. For example:
   ```sh
   for instance in $(aws ec2 describe-instances --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId" --output text); do
       aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id $instance --disable-api-termination
   done
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that termination protection is enabled for your EC2 instances using the AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of Termination Protection not being enabled in EC2 instances using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here are the steps to ensure Termination Protection is enabled for your EC2 instances:

1. **Install Boto3 Library**:
   Ensure you have the Boto3 library installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already.
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by directly configuring the `~/.aws/credentials` file.

3. **Python Script to Enable Termination Protection**:
   Write a Python script to enable Termination Protection for your EC2 instances. Below is an example script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon EC2
   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   # List of instance IDs for which you want to enable termination protection
   instance_ids = ['i-1234567890abcdef0', 'i-0abcdef1234567890']

   # Enable termination protection for each instance
   for instance_id in instance_ids:
       response = ec2.modify_instance_attribute(
           InstanceId=instance_id,
           DisableApiTermination={
               'Value': True
           }
       )
       print(f"Termination protection enabled for instance: {instance_id}")

   print("Termination protection has been enabled for all specified instances.")
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to enable Termination Protection for the specified EC2 instances.
   ```bash
   python enable_termination_protection.py
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that Termination Protection is enabled for your EC2 instances, thereby preventing accidental termination.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose 'Instances'.

3. Select the instance that you want to check.

4. In the 'Description' tab, look for 'Termination protection'. If it is 'Enabled', then termination protection is turned on for the instance. If it is 'Disabled', then termination protection is not turned on.

Please note that you can't enable termination protection for instances that are in a 'Terminating' state.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 instances: Use the following command to list all the EC2 instances in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with details about all your EC2 instances.

3. Check termination protection status: For each instance, you can check the termination protection status by using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --attribute disableApiTermination
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of your EC2 instance. This command will return a JSON output with the termination protection status of the specified instance.

4. Analyze the output: If the `DisableApiTermination` attribute is set to `true`, it means that termination protection is enabled for the instance. If it's set to `false`, it means that termination protection is not enabled. Repeat step 3 for each instance in your AWS account to check the termination protection status of all instances.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. You can configure it in several ways. The simplest way is to install the AWS CLI and then run `aws configure`.

3. Write the Python script: The following Python script uses Boto3 to check if termination protection is enabled for all EC2 instances in a region.

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_termination_protection():
       ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
       response = ec2.describe_instances()
       for reservation in response['Reservations']:
           for instance in reservation['Instances']:
               instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
               termination_protection = ec2.describe_instance_attribute(
                   InstanceId=instance_id,
                   Attribute='disableApiTermination'
               )
               if not termination_protection['DisableApiTermination']['Value']:
                   print(f"Instance {instance_id} does not have termination protection enabled.")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_termination_protection()
   ```

4. Run the Python script: You can run the Python script using the Python interpreter. The script will print the IDs of all EC2 instances that do not have termination protection enabled.

   ```bash
   python check_termination_protection.py
   ```

This script only checks for EC2 instances in the default region. If you have EC2 instances in other regions, you need to modify the script to check those regions as well.
