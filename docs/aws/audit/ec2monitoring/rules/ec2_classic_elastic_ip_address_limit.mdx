### Remediation

How to remediate if EC2-Classic elastic IP address limit is reached.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
2. From the left navigation pane, click on "Elastic IPs" to view the list of Elastic IP addresses.
3. Verify that you have reached the limit of EC2-Classic Elastic IP addresses. The "Account limit" column will display the maximum number of Elastic IP addresses allowed for your account.
4. Determine if you need additional Elastic IP addresses in EC2-Classic or if migrating to Amazon VPC is a viable option. Note that EC2-Classic is the older networking platform, and AWS recommends using Amazon VPC for new resources.
5. If you need additional Elastic IP addresses in EC2-Classic:
   - Request a limit increase for the EC2-Classic Elastic IP addresses by clicking on the "Request limit increase" link in the "Account limit" column. Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information to request the increase. AWS will review the request, and if approved, you will be able to allocate more Elastic IP addresses in EC2-Classic.
   - Alternatively, consider releasing unused Elastic IP addresses that are no longer needed to free up capacity. Select the Elastic IP addresses that are not in use and click on the "Release Elastic IPs" button above the list. Confirm the release when prompted.
6. If you decide to migrate to Amazon VPC:
   - Familiarize yourself with Amazon VPC and the migration process. Review the AWS documentation and best practices for migrating to Amazon VPC from EC2-Classic.
   - Create a new VPC in the AWS Management Console by navigating to the Amazon VPC service. Follow the prompts and configure the VPC based on your requirements.
   - Migrate your EC2 instances from EC2-Classic to the newly created VPC. This involves launching new instances in the VPC, setting up appropriate security groups, and transferring any necessary data.
   - Allocate Elastic IP addresses in the VPC for your migrated instances. In the Amazon VPC service, click on "Elastic IPs" and allocate new addresses specifically for your VPC.
   - Associate the newly allocated Elastic IP addresses with the appropriate instances in the VPC. Select the Elastic IP address and click on the "Associate Elastic IP address" button. Follow the prompts to associate the address with the desired instance in the VPC.
   - Once all instances are successfully migrated and associated with VPC Elastic IP addresses, you can release any remaining EC2-Classic Elastic IP addresses that are no longer needed.
