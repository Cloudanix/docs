<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of ensuring X-Ray tracing is enabled for Elastic Beanstalk environments in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to enable X-Ray tracing for Elastic Beanstalk environments:

```
aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name <your-environment-name> --option-settings Namespace=aws:elasticbeanstalk:xray,OptionName=XRayEnabled,Value=true
```

Replace `<your-environment-name>` with the name of your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

3. Once the command is executed successfully, X-Ray tracing will be enabled for your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

4. You can verify the configuration by going to the Elastic Beanstalk console, selecting your environment, and checking the Configuration tab. Under the Software configuration section, you should see the X-Ray tracing enabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of ensuring X-Ray tracing is enabled for Elastic Beanstalk environments in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of X-Ray tracing not being enabled for Elastic Beanstalk environments in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the Boto3 library to interact with AWS services using Python:

```
import boto3
```

2. Create a client for Elastic Beanstalk:

```
eb_client = boto3.client('elasticbeanstalk')
```

3. Get a list of all existing Elastic Beanstalk environments:

```
environments = eb_client.describe_environments()
```

4. Loop through the environments and check if X-Ray tracing is enabled. If not, enable it:

```
for env in environments['Environments']:
    env_name = env['EnvironmentName']
    env_description = eb_client.describe_configuration_settings(ApplicationName=env['ApplicationName'], EnvironmentName=env_name)
    for setting in env_description['ConfigurationSettings'][0]['OptionSettings']:
        if setting['Namespace'] == 'aws:elasticbeanstalk:xray':
            if setting['OptionName'] == 'XRayEnabled' and setting['Value'] == 'false':
                eb_client.update_environment(
                    ApplicationName=env['ApplicationName'],
                    EnvironmentName=env_name,
                    OptionSettings=[
                        {
                            'Namespace': 'aws:elasticbeanstalk:xray',
                            'OptionName': 'XRayEnabled',
                            'Value': 'true'
                        }
                    ]
                )
```

5. Run the Python script to remediate the misconfiguration of X-Ray tracing not being enabled for Elastic Beanstalk environments in AWS.

This script will enable X-Ray tracing for all Elastic Beanstalk environments where it is not already enabled.
