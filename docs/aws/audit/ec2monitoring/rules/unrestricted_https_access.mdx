How to update security group inbound or ingress configuration to restrict HTTPS port 443 access to specific entities?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS/Azure/GCP console and go to the security group that needs to be updated.
2. Identify the security group rule that allows inbound/ingress traffic on port 443.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Unrestricted HTTPS Access Should Not Be Allowed" Policy.)
3. Edit the inbound/ingress rule by clicking on the "Edit" button.
4. Change the source of the rule to only allow traffic from specific entities, such as IP addresses or security groups.
5. If you want to restrict access to a specific IP address, enter the IP address in the "Source" field. You can also specify an IP range by using CIDR notation.
6. If you want to restrict access to a specific security group, select the security group from the dropdown list in the "Source" field.
7. Save the changes to the security group rule.
