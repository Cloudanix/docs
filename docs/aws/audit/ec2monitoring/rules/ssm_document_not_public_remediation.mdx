1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Systems Manager home page.

2. In the navigation pane, choose Documents under Shared Resources.

3. In the list of documents, select the document you want to check.

4. In the document details page, check the "Owner" and "Shared with" fields. If the "Owner" is not your account or "Shared with" is set to "Public", then the SSM document is public.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all SSM Documents: Use the AWS CLI command `aws ssm list-documents` to list all the SSM documents in your AWS account. The command will return a JSON object with details about each SSM document.

   ```
   aws ssm list-documents
   ```
3. Check the permissions of each SSM Document: For each SSM document, you can use the `aws ssm describe-document-permission` command to check its permissions. You need to provide the name of the SSM document as a parameter.

   ```
   aws ssm describe-document-permission --name "document-name"
   ```
   This command will return a JSON object with the permissions of the specified SSM document.

4. Identify public SSM Documents: If the `describe-document-permission` command returns a permission type of "Share" and the account IDs include "*", this indicates that the SSM document is public. You can use a script to automate this process and identify all public SSM documents.

   Here is a simple Python script that uses the AWS SDK (boto3) to do this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   ssm = boto3.client('ssm')

   response = ssm.list_documents()

   for document in response['DocumentIdentifiers']:
       permissions = ssm.describe_document_permission(
           Name=document['Name'],
           PermissionType='Share'
       )
       if '*' in permissions['AccountIdsToShare']:
           print(f"Document {document['Name']} is public")
   ```
   This script lists all SSM documents, checks their permissions, and prints the names of the documents that are public.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To detect if an SSM Document is public in EC2 using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the Boto3 library in Python:**

    Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

    ```python
    pip install boto3
    ```

2. **Create an AWS session using Boto3:**

    You need to create a session using your AWS credentials. You can configure your credentials in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI tool. Here is an example:

    ```python
    import boto3

    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
        aws_session_token='SESSION_TOKEN',
    )
    ```

3. **Get the list of all SSM documents:**

    Use the `describe_document_permission` method to get the list of all SSM documents and their permissions. This method returns all the SSM documents along with their permissions (Share, Private, Public).

    ```python
    ssm = session.client('ssm')
    response = ssm.describe_document_permission(
        Name='string',
        PermissionType='Share'
    )
    ```

4. **Check if the SSM document is public:**

    Iterate over the response from the previous step and check if any SSM document has the permission type as 'Public'. If it does, then the SSM document is public.

    ```python
    for document in response['DocumentPermissions']:
        if document['PermissionType'] == 'Public':
            print(f"SSM Document {document['Name']} is public")
    ```

This script will print the names of all the SSM documents that are public.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the issue of SSM document being public in AWS EC2 using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console and login with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to Systems Manager (SSM)**: Go to the AWS Systems Manager service by typing "Systems Manager" in the search bar and selecting it from the dropdown.

3. **Access SSM Documents**: In the Systems Manager console, navigate to the left-hand menu and click on "Documents" under the "Shared Resources" section.

4. **Identify Public SSM Documents**: Look through the list of SSM documents to identify the ones that are marked as public. These will have a permission setting indicating that they are public.

5. **Change Document Permissions**:
   - Select the public SSM document by clicking on it.
   - Click on the "Edit" button to modify the document permissions.
   - In the document permissions settings, change the visibility from public to private.
   - Save the changes.

6. **Verify Changes**: After changing the permissions, verify that the SSM document is no longer public by checking the permissions settings.

7. **Monitor for Compliance**: Regularly monitor the SSM documents to ensure that they are not set to public in the future.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of SSM documents being public in AWS EC2 using the AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the issue of an SSM Document being public in AWS EC2 using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the public SSM Documents**: Run the following AWS CLI command to list all public SSM Documents:
   ```
   aws ssm list-documents --filters Key=Owner,Values=Public
   ```

2. **Update the SSM Document to be private**: You will need to update the SSM Document to be private. You can do this by running the following AWS CLI command:
   ```
   aws ssm modify-document-permission --name "DOCUMENT_NAME" --permission-type "PRIVATE"
   ```
   Replace `DOCUMENT_NAME` with the name of the public SSM Document that you want to make private.

3. **Verify the SSM Document is now private**: To confirm that the SSM Document is now private, you can run the following AWS CLI command:
   ```
   aws ssm describe-document --name "DOCUMENT_NAME"
   ```
   Replace `DOCUMENT_NAME` with the name of the SSM Document you updated.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of having an SSM Document public for AWS EC2 instances using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the SSM Document that is public:
   - Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all the SSM Documents in your AWS account.
   - Check the permissions of each SSM Document to identify if any of them are public.

2. Revoke public access to the SSM Document:
   - Use the `modify_document_permission` API provided by Boto3 to update the permissions of the public SSM Document.
   - Set the permissions to restrict public access by removing the 'Allow' permission for the 'Everyone' group.

3. Implement the remediation steps in Python:
   - Install the Boto3 library if you haven't already:
     ```bash
     pip install boto3
     ```
   - Use the following Python script as a reference to identify and revoke public access to the SSM Document:

     ```python
     import boto3

     # Initialize the Boto3 client for AWS Systems Manager (SSM)
     ssm_client = boto3.client('ssm')

     def revoke_public_access_to_ssm_documents():
         # List all SSM Documents
         response = ssm_client.list_documents()

         for document in response['DocumentIdentifiers']:
             document_name = document['Name']
             document_description = ssm_client.describe_document(Name=document_name)
             document_permission = document_description['Document']['Permissions']

             for permission in document_permission:
                 if permission['Type'] == 'Public':
                     # Revoke public access by removing the 'Allow' permission for 'Everyone'
                     ssm_client.modify_document_permission(
                         Name=document_name,
                         PermissionType='Share',
                         AccountIds=[],
                         SharedDocumentVersion='',
                         PermissionLevel='Private'
                     )
                     print(f"Revoked public access for SSM Document: {document_name}")

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         revoke_public_access_to_ssm_documents()
     ```

4. Run the Python script:
   - Save the above Python script in a file (e.g., `remediate_public_ssm_document.py`).
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```bash
     python remediate_public_ssm_document.py
     ```

By following these steps and running the provided Python script, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of having a public SSM Document for AWS EC2 instances.
