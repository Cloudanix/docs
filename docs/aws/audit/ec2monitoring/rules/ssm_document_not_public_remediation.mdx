To remediate the issue of SSM document being public in AWS EC2 using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console and login with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to Systems Manager (SSM)**: Go to the AWS Systems Manager service by typing "Systems Manager" in the search bar and selecting it from the dropdown.

3. **Access SSM Documents**: In the Systems Manager console, navigate to the left-hand menu and click on "Documents" under the "Shared Resources" section.

4. **Identify Public SSM Documents**: Look through the list of SSM documents to identify the ones that are marked as public. These will have a permission setting indicating that they are public.

5. **Change Document Permissions**:
   - Select the public SSM document by clicking on it.
   - Click on the "Edit" button to modify the document permissions.
   - In the document permissions settings, change the visibility from public to private.
   - Save the changes.

6. **Verify Changes**: After changing the permissions, verify that the SSM document is no longer public by checking the permissions settings.

7. **Monitor for Compliance**: Regularly monitor the SSM documents to ensure that they are not set to public in the future.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of SSM documents being public in AWS EC2 using the AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the issue of an SSM Document being public in AWS EC2 using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the public SSM Documents**: Run the following AWS CLI command to list all public SSM Documents:
   ```
   aws ssm list-documents --filters Key=Owner,Values=Public
   ```

2. **Update the SSM Document to be private**: You will need to update the SSM Document to be private. You can do this by running the following AWS CLI command:
   ```
   aws ssm modify-document-permission --name "DOCUMENT_NAME" --permission-type "PRIVATE"
   ```
   Replace `DOCUMENT_NAME` with the name of the public SSM Document that you want to make private.

3. **Verify the SSM Document is now private**: To confirm that the SSM Document is now private, you can run the following AWS CLI command:
   ```
   aws ssm describe-document --name "DOCUMENT_NAME"
   ```
   Replace `DOCUMENT_NAME` with the name of the SSM Document you updated.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the issue of an SSM Document being public in AWS EC2 using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of having an SSM Document public for AWS EC2 instances using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the SSM Document that is public:
   - Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all the SSM Documents in your AWS account.
   - Check the permissions of each SSM Document to identify if any of them are public.

2. Revoke public access to the SSM Document:
   - Use the `modify_document_permission` API provided by Boto3 to update the permissions of the public SSM Document.
   - Set the permissions to restrict public access by removing the 'Allow' permission for the 'Everyone' group.

3. Implement the remediation steps in Python:
   - Install the Boto3 library if you haven't already:
     ```bash
     pip install boto3
     ```
   - Use the following Python script as a reference to identify and revoke public access to the SSM Document:

     ```python
     import boto3

     # Initialize the Boto3 client for AWS Systems Manager (SSM)
     ssm_client = boto3.client('ssm')

     def revoke_public_access_to_ssm_documents():
         # List all SSM Documents
         response = ssm_client.list_documents()

         for document in response['DocumentIdentifiers']:
             document_name = document['Name']
             document_description = ssm_client.describe_document(Name=document_name)
             document_permission = document_description['Document']['Permissions']

             for permission in document_permission:
                 if permission['Type'] == 'Public':
                     # Revoke public access by removing the 'Allow' permission for 'Everyone'
                     ssm_client.modify_document_permission(
                         Name=document_name,
                         PermissionType='Share',
                         AccountIds=[],
                         SharedDocumentVersion='',
                         PermissionLevel='Private'
                     )
                     print(f"Revoked public access for SSM Document: {document_name}")

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         revoke_public_access_to_ssm_documents()
     ```

4. Run the Python script:
   - Save the above Python script in a file (e.g., `remediate_public_ssm_document.py`).
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```bash
     python remediate_public_ssm_document.py
     ```

By following these steps and running the provided Python script, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of having a public SSM Document for AWS EC2 instances.
