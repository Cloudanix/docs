### Remediation

#### Using Console

To enable alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk.
3. Select the application you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Configuration" tab in the left-hand menu.
5. Scroll down to the "Notifications" section and click on "Edit".
6. Select the events for which you want to receive notifications.
7. Choose the notification method (e.g. email, SMS, etc.).
8. Enter the email or phone number where you want to receive the notifications.
9. Click on "Save" to save your changes.

Once you have completed these steps, you will receive notifications for the selected Elastic Beanstalk events via the chosen notification method.

#### Using CLI

To enable alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or terminal.

2. Run the following command to enable alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events:

```
aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name <environment-name> --option-settings Namespace=aws:elasticbeanstalk:sns:topics,OptionName=Notification Endpoint,Value=<email-address>
```

Note: Replace `<environment-name>` with the name of the Elastic Beanstalk environment for which you want to enable alert notifications and `<email-address>` with the email address where you want to receive the notifications.

3. After running the above command, you should receive a confirmation message that the environment has been updated.

4. Now, whenever an Elastic Beanstalk event occurs in the specified environment, you will receive an email notification at the specified email address.

That's it! You have successfully enabled alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To enable alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Create an SNS topic:
```python
sns = boto3.client('sns')
response = sns.create_topic(Name='elastic-beanstalk-notifications')
topic_arn = response['TopicArn']
```

3. Create a subscription to the SNS topic:
```python
response = sns.subscribe(
    TopicArn=topic_arn,
    Protocol='email',
    Endpoint='your-email@example.com'
)
subscription_arn = response['SubscriptionArn']
```

4. Create a new CloudWatch alarm:
```python
cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
response = cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
    AlarmName='elastic-beanstalk-notifications',
    AlarmDescription='Alarm for Elastic Beanstalk events',
    ActionsEnabled=True,
    AlarmActions=[topic_arn],
    MetricName='EnvironmentHealth',
    Namespace='AWS/ElasticBeanstalk',
    Statistic='Average',
    Dimensions=[
        {
            'Name': 'EnvironmentName',
            'Value': 'your-environment-name'
        }
    ],
    Period=60,
    EvaluationPeriods=1,
    Threshold=1,
    ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold'
)
```

5. Verify that the CloudWatch alarm was created:
```python
response = cloudwatch.describe_alarms(
    AlarmNames=['elastic-beanstalk-notifications']
)
print(response)
```

These steps will create an SNS topic, subscribe an email address to it, and create a CloudWatch alarm that sends notifications to the SNS topic when an Elastic Beanstalk event occurs.
