### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk service.
2. Select the desired Elastic Beanstalk environment from the list.
3. In the navigation pane, select "Configuration" under the environment name.
4. In the "Configuration" section, look for the "Monitoring" category. If the "Email Notification" is not enabled, it means that the Alert Notifications for Elastic Beanstalk Events are not set up.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account details. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all the Elastic Beanstalk environments: Use the following command to list all the Elastic Beanstalk environments in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws elasticbeanstalk describe-environments
   ```
   This command will return a JSON object that contains information about all your Elastic Beanstalk environments.

3. Check the event notifications for each environment: For each environment, you can check the event notifications by using the following command:

   ```
   aws elasticbeanstalk describe-configuration-settings --environment-name <your-environment-name>
   ```
   Replace `<your-environment-name>` with the name of your Elastic Beanstalk environment. This command will return a JSON object that contains the configuration settings for the specified environment.

4. Check the "Notification" section in the output: In the output of the previous command, look for the "Notification" section. If this section is missing or if it doesn't contain the necessary configuration for alert notifications, then the alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events are not enabled.

#### Using Python

To check if Alert Notifications for Elastic Beanstalk Events are enabled in EC2 using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to directly interact with AWS services, including Elastic Beanstalk. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the Boto3 library in your Python script:**

    ```python
    import boto3
    ```

2. **Create an Elastic Beanstalk client:**

    ```python
    client = boto3.client('elasticbeanstalk')
    ```

3. **Retrieve the list of all Elastic Beanstalk environments:**

    ```python
    environments = client.describe_environments()
    ```

4. **Check if the Notification Endpoint is configured for each environment:**

    ```python
    for environment in environments['Environments']:
        env_name = environment['EnvironmentName']
        response = client.describe_configuration_settings(
            ApplicationName=environment['ApplicationName'],
            EnvironmentName=env_name
        )
        for setting in response['ConfigurationSettings']:
            for option in setting['OptionSettings']:
                if option['Namespace'] == 'aws:elasticbeanstalk:sns:topics' and option['OptionName'] == 'Notification Endpoint':
                    print(f"Environment {env_name} has Notification Endpoint set to {option['Value']}")
                else:
                    print(f"Environment {env_name} does not have Notification Endpoint set")
    ```

This script will print out whether each Elastic Beanstalk environment has a Notification Endpoint set. If the Notification Endpoint is not set, it means that Alert Notifications for Elastic Beanstalk Events are not enabled for that environment.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To enable alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk.
3. Select the application you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Configuration" tab in the left-hand menu.
5. Scroll down to the "Notifications" section and click on "Edit".
6. Select the events for which you want to receive notifications.
7. Choose the notification method (e.g. email, SMS, etc.).
8. Enter the email or phone number where you want to receive the notifications.
9. Click on "Save" to save your changes.

Once you have completed these steps, you will receive notifications for the selected Elastic Beanstalk events via the chosen notification method.

#### Using CLI

To enable alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or terminal.

2. Run the following command to enable alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events:

```
aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name <environment-name> --option-settings Namespace=aws:elasticbeanstalk:sns:topics,OptionName=Notification Endpoint,Value=<email-address>
```

Note: Replace `<environment-name>` with the name of the Elastic Beanstalk environment for which you want to enable alert notifications and `<email-address>` with the email address where you want to receive the notifications.

3. After running the above command, you should receive a confirmation message that the environment has been updated.

4. Now, whenever an Elastic Beanstalk event occurs in the specified environment, you will receive an email notification at the specified email address.

That's it! You have successfully enabled alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To enable alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Create an SNS topic:
```python
sns = boto3.client('sns')
response = sns.create_topic(Name='elastic-beanstalk-notifications')
topic_arn = response['TopicArn']
```

3. Create a subscription to the SNS topic:
```python
response = sns.subscribe(
    TopicArn=topic_arn,
    Protocol='email',
    Endpoint='your-email@example.com'
)
subscription_arn = response['SubscriptionArn']
```

4. Create a new CloudWatch alarm:
```python
cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
response = cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
    AlarmName='elastic-beanstalk-notifications',
    AlarmDescription='Alarm for Elastic Beanstalk events',
    ActionsEnabled=True,
    AlarmActions=[topic_arn],
    MetricName='EnvironmentHealth',
    Namespace='AWS/ElasticBeanstalk',
    Statistic='Average',
    Dimensions=[
        {
            'Name': 'EnvironmentName',
            'Value': 'your-environment-name'
        }
    ],
    Period=60,
    EvaluationPeriods=1,
    Threshold=1,
    ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold'
)
```

5. Verify that the CloudWatch alarm was created:
```python
response = cloudwatch.describe_alarms(
    AlarmNames=['elastic-beanstalk-notifications']
)
print(response)
```

These steps will create an SNS topic, subscribe an email address to it, and create a CloudWatch alarm that sends notifications to the SNS topic when an Elastic Beanstalk event occurs.
