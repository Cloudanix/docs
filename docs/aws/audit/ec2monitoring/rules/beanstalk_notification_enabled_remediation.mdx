1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk service.

2. Select the Elastic Beanstalk environment for which you want to enable alert notifications.

3. In the navigation pane, select "Configuration" under the environment name.

4. In the Configuration overview page, find the "Monitoring" category. If the "Update" button is available, it means that the alert notifications are not enabled. If the "View" button is available, it means that the alert notifications are enabled.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "describe-configuration-settings" command to check the configuration of your Elastic Beanstalk environment. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws elasticbeanstalk describe-configuration-settings --application-name my-app --environment-name my-env
   ```

   Replace "my-app" with the name of your application and "my-env" with the name of your environment.

3. This command will return a JSON output with all the configuration settings of your environment. You need to look for the "OptionSettings" field in the output. This field contains a list of all the options that are currently set in your environment.

4. To check if alert notifications are enabled, you need to look for the "Namespace" field with the value "aws:elasticbeanstalk:sns:topics". If this field is present, it means that alert notifications are enabled. If it's not present, it means that alert notifications are not enabled.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if Alert Notifications for Elastic Beanstalk Events are enabled in EC2 using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to directly interact with AWS services, including Elastic Beanstalk. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS:**

    ```python
    import boto3
    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
        region_name='us-west-2'
    )
    ```

    Replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your actual AWS access and secret keys. The 'region_name' should be the region where your Elastic Beanstalk environment is located.

2. **Create an Elastic Beanstalk client:**

    ```python
    eb = session.client('elasticbeanstalk')
    ```

3. **Get the list of all Elastic Beanstalk environments:**

    ```python
    environments = eb.describe_environments()
    ```

4. **Check if Alert Notifications are enabled for each environment:**

    ```python
    for environment in environments['Environments']:
        env_name = environment['EnvironmentName']
        option_settings = eb.describe_configuration_options(
            ApplicationName=environment['ApplicationName'],
            EnvironmentName=env_name
        )
        for option in option_settings['OptionSettings']:
            if option['Namespace'] == 'aws:elasticbeanstalk:sns:topics':
                if option['OptionName'] == 'Notification Endpoint':
                    if option['Value'] == '':
                        print(f"Alert Notifications are not enabled for {env_name}")
    ```

    This script will print the names of all Elastic Beanstalk environments where Alert Notifications are not enabled.

Please note that this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to list and describe Elastic Beanstalk environments and their configuration options. If you don't, you may need to adjust your IAM policies accordingly.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To enable alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk.
3. Select the application you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Configuration" tab in the left-hand menu.
5. Scroll down to the "Notifications" section and click on "Edit".
6. Select the events for which you want to receive notifications.
7. Choose the notification method (e.g. email, SMS, etc.).
8. Enter the email or phone number where you want to receive the notifications.
9. Click on "Save" to save your changes.

Once you have completed these steps, you will receive notifications for the selected Elastic Beanstalk events via the chosen notification method.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To enable alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or terminal.

2. Run the following command to enable alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events:

```
aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name <environment-name> --option-settings Namespace=aws:elasticbeanstalk:sns:topics,OptionName=Notification Endpoint,Value=<email-address>
```

Note: Replace `<environment-name>` with the name of the Elastic Beanstalk environment for which you want to enable alert notifications and `<email-address>` with the email address where you want to receive the notifications.

3. After running the above command, you should receive a confirmation message that the environment has been updated.

4. Now, whenever an Elastic Beanstalk event occurs in the specified environment, you will receive an email notification at the specified email address.

That's it! You have successfully enabled alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To enable alert notifications for Elastic Beanstalk events in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Create an SNS topic:
```python
sns = boto3.client('sns')
response = sns.create_topic(Name='elastic-beanstalk-notifications')
topic_arn = response['TopicArn']
```

3. Create a subscription to the SNS topic:
```python
response = sns.subscribe(
    TopicArn=topic_arn,
    Protocol='email',
    Endpoint='your-email@example.com'
)
subscription_arn = response['SubscriptionArn']
```

4. Create a new CloudWatch alarm:
```python
cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
response = cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
    AlarmName='elastic-beanstalk-notifications',
    AlarmDescription='Alarm for Elastic Beanstalk events',
    ActionsEnabled=True,
    AlarmActions=[topic_arn],
    MetricName='EnvironmentHealth',
    Namespace='AWS/ElasticBeanstalk',
    Statistic='Average',
    Dimensions=[
        {
            'Name': 'EnvironmentName',
            'Value': 'your-environment-name'
        }
    ],
    Period=60,
    EvaluationPeriods=1,
    Threshold=1,
    ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold'
)
```

5. Verify that the CloudWatch alarm was created:
```python
response = cloudwatch.describe_alarms(
    AlarmNames=['elastic-beanstalk-notifications']
)
print(response)
```

These steps will create an SNS topic, subscribe an email address to it, and create a CloudWatch alarm that sends notifications to the SNS topic when an Elastic Beanstalk event occurs.
