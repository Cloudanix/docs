How to update security group inbound or ingress configuration to restrict DNS TCP and UDP port 53 access to specific entities?

#### Using AWS Console

1. First, login to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. From the EC2 dashboard, select the Security Groups option from the left-hand menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Unrestricted DNS Access Should Not Be Allowed" Policy.)
3. Locate the security group that needs to be updated and select it.
4. Select the Inbound Rules tab.
5. Locate the rule that allows TCP and UDP traffic on port 53 for DNS and select the Edit button.
6. In the Edit inbound rule dialog box, select the source of the traffic that you want to allow. For example, you can specify a specific IP address, range of IP addresses, or a security group.
7. Select the Save rules button to apply the changes.
8. Verify that the changes have been applied by testing the DNS connectivity from the allowed entities
