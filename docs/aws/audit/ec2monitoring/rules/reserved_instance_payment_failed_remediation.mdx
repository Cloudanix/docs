1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "RESOURCES", click on "Reserved Instances".
3. In the Reserved Instances dashboard, you can see the list of all your reserved instances. Check the "State" column for each reserved instance.
4. If the state of any reserved instance is "payment-failed", it indicates that the payment for that reserved instance has failed.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 Reserved Instances: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all your EC2 Reserved Instances:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --query 'ReservedInstances[*].[ReservedInstancesId,State]' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all your Reserved Instances along with their IDs and states.

3. Check for Payment Failed status: From the output of the above command, check if any of the Reserved Instances have their state as 'payment-failed'. If any Reserved Instance has this state, it means that the payment for that Reserved Instance has failed.

4. Automate the process with a Python script: You can automate this process by writing a Python script that uses the boto3 library to interact with AWS. The script would use the `describe_reserved_instances` function to get a list of all Reserved Instances and then check the 'State' of each Reserved Instance to see if it is 'payment-failed'. If it finds any Reserved Instance with this state, it can print out the ID of that Reserved Instance.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3, AWS EC2, AWS DynamoDB, and much more. To install Boto3, you can use pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

   You also need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws configure
   ```

   Then follow the prompts to input your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. Use Boto3 to interact with AWS EC2: You can use Boto3 to create, configure, and manage AWS services. For example, you can start or stop EC2 instances, create security groups, and so on. Here is a simple script to list all EC2 instances:

   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

   for instance in ec2.instances.all():
       print(instance.id, instance.state)
   ```

3. Check the status of Reserved Instances: You can use the `describe_reserved_instances` method to get information about Reserved Instances. The `State` field indicates whether the Reserved Instance is active, payment-pending, retired, etc. Here is a script to check if any Reserved Instances have payment failed:

   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

   response = ec2.describe_reserved_instances()

   for ri in response['ReservedInstances']:
       if ri['State'] == 'payment-failed':
           print(f"Reserved Instance {ri['ReservedInstancesId']} has payment failed.")
   ```

4. Handle the results: Depending on your needs, you can modify the script to take action when it finds a Reserved Instance with payment failed. For example, you could send an email notification, log the event, etc. Remember to handle exceptions and errors appropriately in your script.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the EC2 Reserved Instances payment failed misconfiguration in AWS, please follow the steps below:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Click on the "Reserved Instances" link on the left-hand side menu.
4. Find the Reserved Instance with the payment failed status and select it.
5. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Modify Reserved Instances".
6. In the "Modify Reserved Instances" window, select the new payment option and click "Save Changes".
7. If the payment information is correct, the Reserved Instance will be reactivated.

Alternatively, you can also remediate this misconfiguration using the AWS CLI by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 modify-reserved-instances --reserved-instances-id <reservation-id> --instance-count <new-instance-count> --payment-option <payment-option>
```

Replace `<reservation-id>` with the ID of the Reserved Instance that has the payment failed status, `<new-instance-count>` with the number of instances you want to reserve and `<payment-option>` with the new payment option you want to use.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the "EC2 Reserved Instances Should Not Have Payment Failed" misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the AWS CLI by using the command `aws configure` and entering your AWS access key ID, secret access key, default region name, and default output format.

2. Check the status of your EC2 Reserved Instances using the command `aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances`.

3. Identify the reserved instances with payment failed status.

4. To remediate the misconfiguration, you can either retry the payment or modify the reserved instance to a different payment option.

5. To retry the payment, use the command `aws ec2 modify-reserved-instances --reserved-instances-id <ID> --offering-id <ID> --instance-count <COUNT> --dry-run` and replace the `<ID>` with the ID of the reserved instance, and `<COUNT>` with the number of instances you want to purchase.

6. To modify the reserved instance to a different payment option, use the command `aws ec2 modify-reserved-instances --reserved-instances-id <ID> --target-configuration OfferingId=<ID>,InstanceCount=<COUNT>` and replace the `<ID>` with the ID of the reserved instance, and `<COUNT>` with the number of instances you want to purchase.

7. After retrying the payment or modifying the reserved instance, use the command `aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances` to verify that the status has been updated to active.

8. Repeat the above steps for all the reserved instances with payment failed status.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the "EC2 Reserved Instances Should Not Have Payment Failed" misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Reserved Instances Should Not Have Payment Failed" for AWS using python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

```
import boto3
```

Step 2: Create an EC2 client object

```
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

Step 3: Get the list of all Reserved Instances

```
reserved_instances = ec2.describe_reserved_instances()
```

Step 4: Iterate through the list of Reserved Instances and check if any of them have a payment failure

```
for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedInstances']:
    if reserved_instance['State'] == 'payment-failed':
        # Perform the remediation action
```

Step 5: Perform the remediation action, which is to modify the payment method and update the Reserved Instance

```
# Modify the payment method
ec2.modify_reserved_instances(
    ReservedInstancesIds=[reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']],
    ClientToken='string',
    TargetConfigurations=[
        {
            'AvailabilityZone': 'string',
            'InstanceCount': 123,
            'InstanceType': 'string',
            'Platform': 'string'
        },
    ],
    PaymentOption='AllUpfront'
)

# Update the Reserved Instance
ec2.modify_reserved_instances(
    ReservedInstancesIds=[reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']],
    ClientToken='string',
    TargetConfigurations=[
        {
            'AvailabilityZone': 'string',
            'InstanceCount': 123,
            'InstanceType': 'string',
            'Platform': 'string'
        },
    ]
)
```

Step 6: Once the remediation action is performed, verify if the Reserved Instance is updated successfully

```
# Verify if the Reserved Instance is updated successfully
reserved_instance = ec2.describe_reserved_instances(
    ReservedInstancesIds=[reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']]
)
if reserved_instance['ReservedInstances'][0]['State'] != 'payment-failed':
    print('Reserved Instance updated successfully')
else:
    print('Failed to update Reserved Instance')
```

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Reserved Instances Should Not Have Payment Failed" for AWS using python.
