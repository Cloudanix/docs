### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu, then selecting "EC2" under the "Compute" category.
3. In the EC2 dashboard, select "Reserved Instances" from the left-hand menu.
4. In the Reserved Instances page, check the "Status" column for any instances that have the status "payment-failed". If any instances have this status, it indicates that the payment for the reserved instance has failed.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 Reserved Instances: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all your EC2 Reserved Instances:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --query 'ReservedInstances[*].[ReservedInstancesId,State]' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all your Reserved Instances along with their IDs and states.

3. Check for Payment Failed status: From the output of the previous command, check if any of the Reserved Instances have a state of 'payment-failed'. If any Reserved Instances have this state, it means that the payment for these instances has failed.

4. Filter Payment Failed Instances: To directly get the instances with payment failed status, you can modify the above command as follows:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --filters Name=state,Values=payment-failed --query 'ReservedInstances[*].[ReservedInstancesId,State]' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all your Reserved Instances that have a 'payment-failed' state.

#### Using Python

To detect if EC2 Reserved Instances have payment failed status using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to directly interact with AWS services, including EC2. Here are the steps:

1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up the AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script to Connect to EC2:**
   Use Boto3 to create an EC2 resource object using the AWS credentials. This object will allow you to interact with the EC2 service.
   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )

   ec2 = session.resource('ec2')
   ```

3. **Retrieve All Reserved Instances:**
   Use the `describe_reserved_instances` method to retrieve all reserved instances. This method returns a dictionary that contains information about all reserved instances.
   ```python
   reserved_instances = ec2.describe_reserved_instances()
   ```

4. **Check for Payment Failed Status:**
   Iterate over the reserved instances and check the `State` attribute. If the state is 'payment-failed', then the payment for that reserved instance has failed.
   ```python
   for instance in reserved_instances['ReservedInstances']:
       if instance['State'] == 'payment-failed':
           print(f"Reserved instance {instance['ReservedInstancesId']} has payment failed status.")
   ```
   This script will print the IDs of all reserved instances that have a payment failed status.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the EC2 Reserved Instances payment failed misconfiguration in AWS, please follow the steps below:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Click on the "Reserved Instances" link on the left-hand side menu.
4. Find the Reserved Instance with the payment failed status and select it.
5. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Modify Reserved Instances".
6. In the "Modify Reserved Instances" window, select the new payment option and click "Save Changes".
7. If the payment information is correct, the Reserved Instance will be reactivated.

Alternatively, you can also remediate this misconfiguration using the AWS CLI by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 modify-reserved-instances --reserved-instances-id <reservation-id> --instance-count <new-instance-count> --payment-option <payment-option>
```

Replace `<reservation-id>` with the ID of the Reserved Instance that has the payment failed status, `<new-instance-count>` with the number of instances you want to reserve and `<payment-option>` with the new payment option you want to use.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "EC2 Reserved Instances Should Not Have Payment Failed" misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the AWS CLI by using the command `aws configure` and entering your AWS access key ID, secret access key, default region name, and default output format.

2. Check the status of your EC2 Reserved Instances using the command `aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances`.

3. Identify the reserved instances with payment failed status.

4. To remediate the misconfiguration, you can either retry the payment or modify the reserved instance to a different payment option.

5. To retry the payment, use the command `aws ec2 modify-reserved-instances --reserved-instances-id <ID> --offering-id <ID> --instance-count <COUNT> --dry-run` and replace the `<ID>` with the ID of the reserved instance, and `<COUNT>` with the number of instances you want to purchase.

6. To modify the reserved instance to a different payment option, use the command `aws ec2 modify-reserved-instances --reserved-instances-id <ID> --target-configuration OfferingId=<ID>,InstanceCount=<COUNT>` and replace the `<ID>` with the ID of the reserved instance, and `<COUNT>` with the number of instances you want to purchase.

7. After retrying the payment or modifying the reserved instance, use the command `aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances` to verify that the status has been updated to active.

8. Repeat the above steps for all the reserved instances with payment failed status.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the "EC2 Reserved Instances Should Not Have Payment Failed" misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Reserved Instances Should Not Have Payment Failed" for AWS using python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

```
import boto3
```

Step 2: Create an EC2 client object

```
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

Step 3: Get the list of all Reserved Instances

```
reserved_instances = ec2.describe_reserved_instances()
```

Step 4: Iterate through the list of Reserved Instances and check if any of them have a payment failure

```
for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedInstances']:
    if reserved_instance['State'] == 'payment-failed':
        # Perform the remediation action
```

Step 5: Perform the remediation action, which is to modify the payment method and update the Reserved Instance

```
# Modify the payment method
ec2.modify_reserved_instances(
    ReservedInstancesIds=[reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']],
    ClientToken='string',
    TargetConfigurations=[
        {
            'AvailabilityZone': 'string',
            'InstanceCount': 123,
            'InstanceType': 'string',
            'Platform': 'string'
        },
    ],
    PaymentOption='AllUpfront'
)

# Update the Reserved Instance
ec2.modify_reserved_instances(
    ReservedInstancesIds=[reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']],
    ClientToken='string',
    TargetConfigurations=[
        {
            'AvailabilityZone': 'string',
            'InstanceCount': 123,
            'InstanceType': 'string',
            'Platform': 'string'
        },
    ]
)
```

Step 6: Once the remediation action is performed, verify if the Reserved Instance is updated successfully

```
# Verify if the Reserved Instance is updated successfully
reserved_instance = ec2.describe_reserved_instances(
    ReservedInstancesIds=[reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']]
)
if reserved_instance['ReservedInstances'][0]['State'] != 'payment-failed':
    print('Reserved Instance updated successfully')
else:
    print('Failed to update Reserved Instance')
```

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "EC2 Reserved Instances Should Not Have Payment Failed" for AWS using python.
