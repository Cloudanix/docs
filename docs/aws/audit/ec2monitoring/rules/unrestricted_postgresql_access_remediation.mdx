1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, select 'Security Groups'. This will display a list of all security groups associated with your EC2 instances.
3. For each security group, select it and then click on the 'Inbound Rules' tab in the lower panel. This will display a list of all inbound rules associated with the selected security group.
4. Check the inbound rules for any that allow unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) to PostgreSQL (default port 5432). If such a rule exists, it indicates that unrestricted PostgreSQL access is allowed, which is a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to list all the security groups in your AWS environment. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId]' --output text
```

2. Once you have the list of all security groups, you need to check the inbound rules for each security group. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query 'SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions[*]' --output json
```
Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group you want to check.

3. In the output of the above command, look for any rules that allow access to port 5432 (the default port for PostgreSQL) from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0). 

4. If such a rule exists, it means that unrestricted PostgreSQL access is allowed, which is a misconfiguration. If no such rule exists, then unrestricted PostgreSQL access is not allowed, which is the correct configuration.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The Boto3 library is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating the credentials file yourself. By default, its location is at `~/.aws/credentials`. At a minimum, the credentials file should look like this:

   ```bash
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Write the Python script: Now you can write a Python script that uses the Boto3 library to check for unrestricted PostgreSQL access in EC2. Here is a simple script that checks for security groups with unrestricted access:

   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

   # Check each security group
   for security_group in ec2.security_groups.all():
       # Check each rule in the security group
       for rule in security_group.ip_permissions:
           # Check if the rule allows unrestricted access to PostgreSQL
           if rule['FromPort'] == 5432 and rule['ToPort'] == 5432:
               for ip_range in rule['IpRanges']:
                   if ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                       print(f"Security group {security_group.id} allows unrestricted PostgreSQL access.")
   ```

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run the script using Python. The script will print out the IDs of any security groups that allow unrestricted access to PostgreSQL:

   ```bash
   python check_postgresql_access.py
   ```

This script only checks for IPv4 addresses. If you also want to check for unrestricted access from IPv6 addresses, you would need to check the 'Ipv6Ranges' field in the rule.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the unrestricted PostgreSQL access issue in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the RDS dashboard.
2. Select the RDS instance that has unrestricted PostgreSQL access.
3. Click on the "Modify" button.
4. In the "Network & Security" section, select the "Additional Configuration" tab.
5. Under "Security Group Rules," locate the rule that allows unrestricted PostgreSQL access.
6. Remove the rule by clicking on the "x" icon next to it.
7. Add a new rule that allows access only from trusted sources.
8. Click on the "Save Changes" button.

By following these steps, you can remediate the unrestricted PostgreSQL access issue in AWS and ensure that your PostgreSQL database is only accessible from trusted sources.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate unrestricted PostgreSQL access in AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to get the security group ID of the security group associated with the PostgreSQL instance:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].VpcSecurityGroups[*].VpcSecurityGroupId' --output text
   ```

2. Run the following command to get the ID of the security group:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=group-id,Values=<security-group-ID> --query 'SecurityGroups[*].{Name:GroupName,ID:GroupId}' --output table
   ```

3. Run the following command to revoke the unrestricted access to PostgreSQL:

   ```
   aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-ID> --protocol tcp --port 5432 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
   ```

   This command will revoke the inbound rule that allows unrestricted access to PostgreSQL.

4. Run the following command to verify that the unrestricted access has been revoked:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=group-id,Values=<security-group-ID> --query 'SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions'
   ```

   This command will show the current inbound rules for the security group. You should see that the rule allowing unrestricted access to PostgreSQL has been removed.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the unrestricted PostgreSQL access in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the unrestricted PostgreSQL access issue in AWS, you can use Python to create a security group that allows access to the PostgreSQL instance only from a specific IP address or range of IP addresses. Here are the steps to do so:

1. First, you need to create a new security group that will be used to restrict access to the PostgreSQL instance. You can do this using the `boto3` library in Python. Here's an example code snippet that creates a new security group:

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

# Create a new security group
security_group = ec2.create_security_group(
    GroupName='PostgreSQLAccess',
    Description='Restrict access to PostgreSQL instance'
)

# Add a rule to allow access to the PostgreSQL port (5432) from a specific IP address
security_group.authorize_ingress(
    IpPermissions=[
        {
            'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
            'FromPort': 5432,
            'ToPort': 5432,
            'IpRanges': [
                {
                    'CidrIp': 'x.x.x.x/32' # Replace x.x.x.x with the specific IP address you want to allow access from
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
```

2. Once you've created the new security group, you need to assign it to the PostgreSQL instance. You can do this using the `modify_db_instance` method from the `boto3` library. Here's an example code snippet that assigns the new security group to the PostgreSQL instance:

```python
import boto3

rds = boto3.client('rds')

# Modify the PostgreSQL instance to use the new security group
response = rds.modify_db_instance(
    DBInstanceIdentifier='your-instance-id', # Replace with your PostgreSQL instance ID
    VpcSecurityGroupIds=[
        security_group.id
    ]
)
```

3. Finally, you can verify that the access to the PostgreSQL instance has been restricted by checking the security group rules associated with the instance. You can do this using the `describe_db_instances` method from the `boto3` library. Here's an example code snippet that checks the security group rules:

```python
import boto3

rds = boto3.client('rds')

# Get the PostgreSQL instance details
response = rds.describe_db_instances(
    DBInstanceIdentifier='your-instance-id' # Replace with your PostgreSQL instance ID
)

# Get the security group IDs associated with the instance
security_group_ids = response['DBInstances'][0]['VpcSecurityGroups']

# Print the security group rules associated with each security group
for security_group_id in security_group_ids:
    response = ec2.describe_security_groups(
        GroupIds=[
            security_group_id['VpcSecurityGroupId']
        ]
    )
    print(response['SecurityGroups'][0]['IpPermissions'])
```

This code will print the security group rules associated with each security group, which should show that access to the PostgreSQL port (5432) is only allowed from the specific IP address or range of IP addresses that you specified in the security group rule.
