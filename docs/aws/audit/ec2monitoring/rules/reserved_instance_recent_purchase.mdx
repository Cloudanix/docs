<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The EC2 Reserved Instances Recent Purchases Should Be Reviewed misconfiguration can be remediated in AWS using the following steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all active Reserved Instances:

```
aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances --filters "Name=state,Values=active"
```

3. Review the output of the above command and identify any recently purchased Reserved Instances that are not being utilized.

4. Run the following command to modify or cancel the unused Reserved Instances:

```
aws ec2 modify-reserved-instances --reserved-instances-id <ID> --target-configuration "InstanceCount=<COUNT>,OfferingId=<OFFERING_ID>"
```

Note: Replace `<ID>` with the Reserved Instance ID and `<COUNT>` with the desired instance count. `<OFFERING_ID>` can be obtained from the Reserved Instance description.

5. Alternatively, to cancel the unused Reserved Instances, run the following command:

```
aws ec2 cancel-reserved-instances-listings --reserved-instances-listing-ids <ID>
```

Note: Replace `<ID>` with the Reserved Instance Listing ID.

6. Repeat step 4 and 5 for all unused Reserved Instances.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
The misconfiguration "EC2 Reserved Instances Recent Purchases Should Be Reviewed" typically refers to a situation where an AWS account has recently purchased EC2 Reserved Instances, but they are not being fully utilized. To remediate this, you can use the following steps:

1. Identify the underutilized EC2 Reserved Instances using the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) by calling the `describe_reserved_instances()` method of the EC2 client object. This method returns information about the specified Reserved Instances, including the number of instances that are currently in use.

```python
import boto3

ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

reserved_instances = ec2_client.describe_reserved_instances()
```

2. Filter the results to only include Reserved Instances that are not being fully utilized. You can do this by comparing the `InstanceCount` attribute to the `InstanceCount` attribute of the `State` object for each Reserved Instance.

```python
underutilized_instances = []

for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedInstances']:
    state = ec2_client.describe_reserved_instances_modifications(
        ReservedInstancesModificationIds=[reserved_instance['ReservedInstancesId']]
    )['ReservedInstancesModifications'][0]['TargetConfigurations'][0]['ReservedInstancesConfiguration']['Scope']

    if reserved_instance['InstanceCount'] > state['InstanceCount']:
        underutilized_instances.append(reserved_instance)
```

3. Review the list of underutilized EC2 Reserved Instances and take appropriate action. This could include modifying the instance type or family to better match your workload, or selling the underutilized Reserved Instances on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.

```python
for instance in underutilized_instances:
    print(f"Underutilized EC2 Reserved Instance: {instance['ReservedInstancesId']}")
```

By following these steps, you can identify and remediate underutilized EC2 Reserved Instances in your AWS account using Python and the boto3 SDK.
