### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose 'Elastic IPs'. This will open a page that lists all the Elastic IPs currently allocated to your AWS account.

3. Count the number of Elastic IPs listed on this page. This is the number of Elastic IPs currently in use.

4. Compare this number with the maximum limit for your account. As of now, AWS allows up to 5 Elastic IPs per region for each AWS account. If the number of Elastic IPs in use is close to or at this limit, then the EC2-VPC Elastic IP Address Limit has been reached. 

Note: The limit can vary if it has been manually changed. You can check your current limit by going to the 'Limits' page in the EC2 dashboard.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all Elastic IPs: Use the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 describe-addresses` to list all the Elastic IP addresses that are currently allocated to your AWS account. This command will return a JSON output with details of all the Elastic IPs.

3. Count the number of Elastic IPs: You can use a tool like `jq` to parse the JSON output and count the number of Elastic IPs. The command would look something like this: `aws ec2 describe-addresses | jq '.Addresses | length'`. This will return the total number of Elastic IPs.

4. Compare with the limit: AWS has a default limit of 5 Elastic IP addresses per region for each AWS account. If the number returned from the previous step is close to or at this limit, then you are at risk of reaching the Elastic IP address limit.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. You can do this using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_key'
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check the Elastic IP limit:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_elastic_ip_limit(region_name):
       ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region_name)
       response = ec2.describe_account_attributes(AttributeNames=['vpc-max-elastic-ips'])
       max_ips = int(response['AccountAttributes'][0]['AttributeValues'][0]['AttributeValue'])
       response = ec2.describe_addresses()
       used_ips = len(response['Addresses'])
       return max_ips, used_ips

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       region = 'us-west-2'  # replace with your region
       max_ips, used_ips = check_elastic_ip_limit(region)
       print(f"Max IPs: {max_ips}, Used IPs: {used_ips}")
   ```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using the Python interpreter. The script will print the maximum number of Elastic IPs allowed and the number of Elastic IPs currently in use. If the number of used IPs is close to the maximum, you may need to request an increase in the limit.

   ```
   python check_elastic_ip_limit.py
   ```

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure. Here are the steps to remediate the EC2-VPC Elastic IP Address Limit Should Not Be Reached issue in AWS:

1. Login to your AWS console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Click on the "Elastic IPs" option from the left navigation pane.
4. Check the "Current Limit" column to see the current limit of Elastic IP addresses for your account.
5. If the current limit has been reached, you will need to request a limit increase. Click on the "Request limit increase" button.
6. Fill out the form with the required details, such as your use case and the new limit you require.
7. Submit the form and wait for AWS to review and approve your request.
8. Once the limit has been increased, you can allocate new Elastic IP addresses as needed.

That's it! By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the EC2-VPC Elastic IP Address Limit Should Not Be Reached issue in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "EC2-VPC Elastic IP Address Limit Should Not Be Reached" misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Check the current limit for Elastic IP addresses in your VPC. Run the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-account-attributes --attribute-names vpc-max-elastic-ips
```

2. If the current limit is reached, you need to request a higher limit. To do this, run the following command:

```
aws ec2 modify-account-attribute --attribute-name vpc-max-elastic-ips --max-elastic-ips <new_limit>
```

Replace `<new_limit>` with the new limit you want to request.

3. If the current limit is not reached, you can release any unused Elastic IP addresses to free up space. To do this, run the following command:

```
aws ec2 release-address --public-ip <public_ip_address>
```

Replace `<public_ip_address>` with the Elastic IP address you want to release.

4. Repeat step 3 for any other unused Elastic IP addresses until you have freed up enough space to stay within the limit.

5. Finally, you can create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the usage of Elastic IP addresses in your VPC. This will alert you if you are approaching the limit again in the future. To create the alarm, follow these steps:

- Open the CloudWatch console.
- Click "Alarms" in the left navigation pane.
- Click "Create alarm".
- Under "Select metric", choose "EC2" and then "Per-Instance Metrics".
- Choose the "Elastic IP addresses allocated" metric.
- Set the threshold for the alarm to the maximum number of Elastic IP addresses you want to allow.
- Choose the action to take when the alarm is triggered (e.g. send an email notification).

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the "EC2-VPC Elastic IP Address Limit Should Not Be Reached" misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the EC2-VPC Elastic IP Address Limit Should Not Be Reached misconfiguration for AWS using python, you can follow these steps:

1. Check the current number of Elastic IP addresses in use in your AWS account by using the boto3 library in Python. You can use the `describe_account_attributes` method of the EC2 client to get this information. Here's an example code snippet:

```
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
response = ec2.describe_account_attributes(
    AttributeNames=['max-elastic-ips']
)
max_ips = response['AccountAttributes'][0]['AttributeValues'][0]['AttributeValue']
print("Max Elastic IPs allowed:", max_ips)

response = ec2.describe_addresses()
num_ips = len(response['Addresses'])
print("Number of Elastic IPs in use:", num_ips)
```

2. If the number of Elastic IPs in use is approaching the limit, you can release some unused Elastic IPs to free up space. You can use the `release_address` method of the EC2 client to release an Elastic IP. Here's an example code snippet:

```
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
response = ec2.describe_addresses()
for address in response['Addresses']:
    if not address['AssociationId']:
        print("Releasing unused Elastic IP:", address['PublicIp'])
        ec2.release_address(AllocationId=address['AllocationId'])
```

3. If you need more Elastic IPs than the current limit, you can request a limit increase from AWS support. You can use the `create_case` method of the AWS support client to create a support case. Here's an example code snippet:

```
import boto3

support = boto3.client('support')
response = support.create_case(
    subject='Request for Elastic IP limit increase',
    serviceCode='amazon-ec2',
    severityCode='low',
    categoryCode='limit-increase',
    communicationBody='Please increase my Elastic IP limit to X.'
)
case_id = response['caseId']
print("Support case created with ID:", case_id)
```

Note: You will need to have the appropriate IAM permissions to perform these actions.
