1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose 'Instances'.

3. On the 'Instances' page, you can see the total number of instances currently running in your account. 

4. Compare this number with the EC2 instance limit for your account. If the number of running instances is close to or exceeds the limit, it indicates a misconfiguration. You can check your account limits by navigating to the 'Limits' page in the EC2 dashboard.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 instances: To get a list of all EC2 instances, you can use the `describe-instances` command. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object that contains information about all your EC2 instances.

3. Count the number of instances: To count the number of instances, you can pipe the output of the `describe-instances` command to the `jq` command. The `jq` command is a command-line JSON processor. You can use it to parse the JSON output and count the number of instances. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances | jq '.Reservations[].Instances[] | .InstanceId' | wc -l
   ```

   This command will return the total number of EC2 instances.

4. Compare the count with the limit: AWS has a limit on the number of EC2 instances that you can run. You can check this limit by using the `describe-account-attributes` command. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-account-attributes --attribute-names max-instances
   ```

   This command will return the maximum number of instances that you can run. You can then compare this number with the count of your current instances to see if you are exceeding the limit.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install Boto3 in your local environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing Boto3, you need to configure it. You can configure it using AWS CLI:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   It will ask for the AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format. You can get these details from your AWS account.

2. Import the necessary libraries and create an EC2 resource object:
   You need to import Boto3 and create an EC2 resource object. This object will allow you to interact with your EC2 instances.
   ```python
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
   ```

3. Get the count of EC2 instances:
   You can get the count of EC2 instances using the `instances.all()` method. This method returns a collection of your EC2 instances. You can get the count of this collection using the `len()` function.
   ```python
   instances = ec2.instances.all()
   instance_count = len(list(instances))
   print("Total EC2 instances: ", instance_count)
   ```

4. Check if the count exceeds the limit:
   You can check if the count of EC2 instances exceeds the limit. If it exceeds the limit, you can print a warning message.
   ```python
   limit = 20  # Set your limit
   if instance_count > limit:
       print("Warning: The count of EC2 instances exceeds the limit!")
   else:
       print("The count of EC2 instances is within the limit.")
   ```
   This script will print a warning message if the count of EC2 instances exceeds the limit. Otherwise, it will print a message saying that the count is within the limit.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the "EC2 Instance Count Should Not Exceed the Limit" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
3. Click on the "Limits" link in the left-hand menu.
4. In the "Service" drop-down menu, select "EC2".
5. In the "Limit types" drop-down menu, select "Running On-Demand Instances".
6. Check the current limit for the region where the misconfiguration was detected.
7. If the limit has been exceeded, click on the "Request limit increase" button.
8. Fill out the form with the required information, including the new limit request and the reason for the increase.
9. Submit the form and wait for AWS to review and approve the request.
10. Once the request is approved, the limit will be increased, and you can launch additional EC2 instances within the new limit.

Note: It is important to regularly monitor your EC2 instance usage and request limit increases as needed to avoid exceeding the limits and incurring unexpected charges.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of EC2 Instance Count Should Not Exceed the Limit in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, check the current EC2 instance count using the AWS CLI command:
```
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId' --output text | wc -w
```

2. If the instance count is exceeding the limit, you need to stop or terminate some of the instances to bring the count below the limit.

3. To stop an instance, use the AWS CLI command:
```
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```
Here, replace `<instance-id>` with the actual ID of the instance that you want to stop.

4. To terminate an instance, use the AWS CLI command:
```
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```
Here, replace `<instance-id>` with the actual ID of the instance that you want to terminate.

5. Repeat step 3 and 4 until the instance count is below the limit.

6. Once the instance count is below the limit, you can monitor it using CloudWatch alarms and set up notifications to alert you if the count exceeds the limit again in the future.

Note: It is important to regularly monitor your AWS resources and set up alerts to avoid exceeding the limits and incurring unexpected charges.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of EC2 instance count exceeding the limit in AWS using Python, follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Set up an AWS session with the required credentials:

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION_NAME'
)
```

3. Create an EC2 client using the session:

```python
ec2_client = session.client('ec2')
```

4. Get the current instance count and the instance limit using the describe_account_attributes() method:

```python
response = ec2_client.describe_account_attributes(
    AttributeNames=['max-instances']
)
```

5. Check if the current instance count exceeds the instance limit:

```python
max_instances = int(response['AccountAttributes'][0]['AttributeValues'][0]['AttributeValue'])
current_instances = ec2_client.describe_instances()['Reservations']
if len(current_instances) > max_instances:
    print("Current instance count exceeds the instance limit.")
```

6. If the current instance count exceeds the instance limit, terminate the excess instances:

```python
excess_instances = len(current_instances) - max_instances
for i in range(excess_instances):
    instance_id = current_instances[i]['Instances'][0]['InstanceId']
    ec2_client.terminate_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
    print("Instance {} terminated.".format(instance_id))
```

7. The final code should look like this:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION_NAME'
)

ec2_client = session.client('ec2')

response = ec2_client.describe_account_attributes(
    AttributeNames=['max-instances']
)

max_instances = int(response['AccountAttributes'][0]['AttributeValues'][0]['AttributeValue'])
current_instances = ec2_client.describe_instances()['Reservations']

if len(current_instances) > max_instances:
    excess_instances = len(current_instances) - max_instances
    for i in range(excess_instances):
        instance_id = current_instances[i]['Instances'][0]['InstanceId']
        ec2_client.terminate_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
        print("Instance {} terminated.".format(instance_id))
else:
    print("Current instance count does not exceed the instance limit.")
```

Note: Make sure to replace the placeholders 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID', 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', and 'YOUR_REGION_NAME' with the actual values.
