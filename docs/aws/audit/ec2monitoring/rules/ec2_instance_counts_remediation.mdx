### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose 'Instances'. Here you can see the total number of instances currently running.

3. To check the limit for your EC2 instances, in the navigation pane, choose 'Limits'. Here you can see the current limit for the number of instances you can run.

4. Compare the number of running instances with the limit. If the number of running instances is close to or exceeds the limit, it indicates a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all EC2 instances: To check the number of EC2 instances, you can use the `describe-instances` command. This command returns information about your EC2 instances. Here is the command you can use:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId]' --output text
   ```

   This command will list all the instance IDs of your EC2 instances.

3. Count the number of EC2 instances: To count the number of EC2 instances, you can pipe the output of the previous command to the `wc -l` command. Here is the command you can use:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId]' --output text | wc -l
   ```

   This command will return the number of lines in the output, which is equal to the number of EC2 instances.

4. Compare the count with the limit: AWS has a limit on the number of EC2 instances you can run. You can check this limit by using the `describe-account-attributes` command. Here is the command you can use:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-account-attributes --attribute-names "max-instances"
   ```

   This command will return the maximum number of instances you can run. You can then compare this number with the count of your current instances to see if you are exceeding the limit.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials either by setting environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, or by creating the credentials file yourself (`~/.aws/credentials`).

2. Import the necessary modules and create an EC2 resource object:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create an EC2 resource object using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)
   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
   ```

3. Use the `describe_instances()` method to retrieve information about all instances:

   ```python
   instances = ec2.instances.all()
   ```

4. Count the number of instances and compare it with the limit. If the number of instances exceeds the limit, print a warning message:

   ```python
   instance_count = len(list(instances))
   instance_limit = 20  # replace with your actual limit

   if instance_count > instance_limit:
       print(f"Warning: The number of EC2 instances ({instance_count}) exceeds the limit ({instance_limit})")
   else:
       print(f"The number of EC2 instances ({instance_count}) is within the limit ({instance_limit})")
   ```

Please note that this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to describe EC2 instances. Also, the limit of EC2 instances can vary depending on the region and the type of your AWS account. You may need to adjust the `instance_limit` variable accordingly.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "EC2 Instance Count Should Not Exceed the Limit" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
3. Click on the "Limits" link in the left-hand menu.
4. In the "Service" drop-down menu, select "EC2".
5. In the "Limit types" drop-down menu, select "Running On-Demand Instances".
6. Check the current limit for the region where the misconfiguration was detected.
7. If the limit has been exceeded, click on the "Request limit increase" button.
8. Fill out the form with the required information, including the new limit request and the reason for the increase.
9. Submit the form and wait for AWS to review and approve the request.
10. Once the request is approved, the limit will be increased, and you can launch additional EC2 instances within the new limit.

Note: It is important to regularly monitor your EC2 instance usage and request limit increases as needed to avoid exceeding the limits and incurring unexpected charges.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of EC2 Instance Count Should Not Exceed the Limit in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, check the current EC2 instance count using the AWS CLI command:
```
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId' --output text | wc -w
```

2. If the instance count is exceeding the limit, you need to stop or terminate some of the instances to bring the count below the limit.

3. To stop an instance, use the AWS CLI command:
```
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```
Here, replace `<instance-id>` with the actual ID of the instance that you want to stop.

4. To terminate an instance, use the AWS CLI command:
```
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```
Here, replace `<instance-id>` with the actual ID of the instance that you want to terminate.

5. Repeat step 3 and 4 until the instance count is below the limit.

6. Once the instance count is below the limit, you can monitor it using CloudWatch alarms and set up notifications to alert you if the count exceeds the limit again in the future.

Note: It is important to regularly monitor your AWS resources and set up alerts to avoid exceeding the limits and incurring unexpected charges.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of EC2 instance count exceeding the limit in AWS using Python, follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Set up an AWS session with the required credentials:

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION_NAME'
)
```

3. Create an EC2 client using the session:

```python
ec2_client = session.client('ec2')
```

4. Get the current instance count and the instance limit using the describe_account_attributes() method:

```python
response = ec2_client.describe_account_attributes(
    AttributeNames=['max-instances']
)
```

5. Check if the current instance count exceeds the instance limit:

```python
max_instances = int(response['AccountAttributes'][0]['AttributeValues'][0]['AttributeValue'])
current_instances = ec2_client.describe_instances()['Reservations']
if len(current_instances) > max_instances:
    print("Current instance count exceeds the instance limit.")
```

6. If the current instance count exceeds the instance limit, terminate the excess instances:

```python
excess_instances = len(current_instances) - max_instances
for i in range(excess_instances):
    instance_id = current_instances[i]['Instances'][0]['InstanceId']
    ec2_client.terminate_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
    print("Instance {} terminated.".format(instance_id))
```

7. The final code should look like this:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION_NAME'
)

ec2_client = session.client('ec2')

response = ec2_client.describe_account_attributes(
    AttributeNames=['max-instances']
)

max_instances = int(response['AccountAttributes'][0]['AttributeValues'][0]['AttributeValue'])
current_instances = ec2_client.describe_instances()['Reservations']

if len(current_instances) > max_instances:
    excess_instances = len(current_instances) - max_instances
    for i in range(excess_instances):
        instance_id = current_instances[i]['Instances'][0]['InstanceId']
        ec2_client.terminate_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
        print("Instance {} terminated.".format(instance_id))
else:
    print("Current instance count does not exceed the instance limit.")
```

Note: Make sure to replace the placeholders 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID', 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', and 'YOUR_REGION_NAME' with the actual values.
