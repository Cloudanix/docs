### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the left navigation pane, under the "Network & Security" section, click on "Security Groups".
3. In the main panel, you will see a list of all the security groups associated with your AWS account. Look for any security group names that are prefixed with "launch-wizard".
4. If you find any, it indicates that the default security group created by the EC2 launch wizard is being used, which is a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can run any AWS CLI commands, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```

   During the configuration process, you will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all Security Groups: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the security groups in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId,GroupName]' --output text
   ```

   This command will return a list of all security groups along with their Group ID and Group Name.

3. Filter Security Groups with Name Prefixed with launch-wizard: You can filter the security groups whose name is prefixed with "launch-wizard" by using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[?starts_with(GroupName, `launch-wizard`)].[GroupId,GroupName]' --output text
   ```

   This command will return a list of all security groups whose name starts with "launch-wizard" along with their Group ID and Group Name.

4. Review the Output: If the output of the above command is not empty, it means there are security groups in your AWS account whose name is prefixed with "launch-wizard". This is a misconfiguration as it is recommended to not use security group names prefixed with "launch-wizard" for EC2 instances.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install Boto3 in your Python environment. You can do this using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing Boto3, you need to configure it. You can do this by creating a new session using your AWS credentials:
   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ```

2. List all Security Groups:
   Use the `describe_security_groups` method to get a list of all security groups in your AWS account:
   ```python
   ec2 = session.client('ec2')
   response = ec2.describe_security_groups()
   ```

3. Check for Security Group Name Prefix:
   Iterate over the list of security groups and check if the name of each security group starts with 'launch-wizard':
   ```python
   for sg in response['SecurityGroups']:
       if 'GroupName' in sg and sg['GroupName'].startswith('launch-wizard'):
           print(f"Security Group {sg['GroupId']} is misconfigured. It starts with 'launch-wizard'.")
   ```

4. Run the script:
   Finally, run the script. If there are any security groups whose name starts with 'launch-wizard', the script will print their IDs. If there are no such security groups, the script will not print anything. This means that there are no misconfigurations in this regard.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Here are the step by step instructions to remediate the "Security Group Name Prefixed With launch-wizard Should Not Be Used" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
3. Click on the "Security Groups" option in the left-hand menu.
4. Identify the security group(s) that have a name prefixed with "launch-wizard".
5. Select the security group(s) that need to be remediated.
6. Click on the "Actions" button, and then select "Edit Group Name".
7. Rename the security group(s) to a more descriptive and meaningful name that does not include the "launch-wizard" prefix.
8. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, the security group(s) will no longer have a name prefixed with "launch-wizard", and the misconfiguration will be remediated.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Security Group Name Prefixed With launch-wizard Should Not Be Used" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or on the AWS EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to list all the security groups in your account:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups
   ```

3. Identify the security group that has a name prefixed with "launch-wizard".

4. Run the following command to rename the security group:

   ```
   aws ec2 update-security-group-name --group-id <security-group-id> --group-name <new-security-group-name>
   ```

   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group that you want to rename, and `<new-security-group-name>` with a new name for the security group that does not have "launch-wizard" prefix.

   For example:

   ```
   aws ec2 update-security-group-name --group-id sg-0123456789abcdef0 --group-name my-security-group
   ```

5. Verify that the security group has been renamed successfully by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>
   ```

   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group that you have renamed.

   The output should show the new name of the security group.

#### Using Python

To remediate the security group name prefixed with `launch-wizard` in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the required modules:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Connect to the AWS account:

```python
client = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Get all the security groups:

```python
response = client.describe_security_groups()
```

4. Loop through all the security groups and check if the name is prefixed with `launch-wizard`:

```python
for sg in response['SecurityGroups']:
    if sg['GroupName'].startswith('launch-wizard'):
        # Delete the security group
        client.delete_security_group(GroupId=sg['GroupId'])
```

5. The above code will delete all the security groups that have a name prefixed with `launch-wizard`. If you want to rename the security group, you can use the below code:

```python
for sg in response['SecurityGroups']:
    if sg['GroupName'].startswith('launch-wizard'):
        new_name = sg['GroupName'].replace('launch-wizard', 'new-name')
        # Rename the security group
        client.update_security_group_name_description(GroupId=sg['GroupId'], GroupName=new_name, Description='New Description')
```

6. The above code will rename all the security groups that have a name prefixed with `launch-wizard` to `new-name`. You can also update the description of the security group as per your requirement.

Note: Before deleting or renaming the security group, make sure that it is not being used by any instances or services.
