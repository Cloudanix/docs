### Remediation

#### Using Console

Here are the step by step instructions to remediate the "Security Group Name Prefixed With launch-wizard Should Not Be Used" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
3. Click on the "Security Groups" option in the left-hand menu.
4. Identify the security group(s) that have a name prefixed with "launch-wizard".
5. Select the security group(s) that need to be remediated.
6. Click on the "Actions" button, and then select "Edit Group Name".
7. Rename the security group(s) to a more descriptive and meaningful name that does not include the "launch-wizard" prefix.
8. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, the security group(s) will no longer have a name prefixed with "launch-wizard", and the misconfiguration will be remediated.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Security Group Name Prefixed With launch-wizard Should Not Be Used" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or on the AWS EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to list all the security groups in your account:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups
   ```

3. Identify the security group that has a name prefixed with "launch-wizard".

4. Run the following command to rename the security group:

   ```
   aws ec2 update-security-group-name --group-id <security-group-id> --group-name <new-security-group-name>
   ```

   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group that you want to rename, and `<new-security-group-name>` with a new name for the security group that does not have "launch-wizard" prefix.

   For example:

   ```
   aws ec2 update-security-group-name --group-id sg-0123456789abcdef0 --group-name my-security-group
   ```

5. Verify that the security group has been renamed successfully by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>
   ```

   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group that you have renamed.

   The output should show the new name of the security group.

#### Using Python

To remediate the security group name prefixed with `launch-wizard` in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the required modules:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Connect to the AWS account:

```python
client = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Get all the security groups:

```python
response = client.describe_security_groups()
```

4. Loop through all the security groups and check if the name is prefixed with `launch-wizard`:

```python
for sg in response['SecurityGroups']:
    if sg['GroupName'].startswith('launch-wizard'):
        # Delete the security group
        client.delete_security_group(GroupId=sg['GroupId'])
```

5. The above code will delete all the security groups that have a name prefixed with `launch-wizard`. If you want to rename the security group, you can use the below code:

```python
for sg in response['SecurityGroups']:
    if sg['GroupName'].startswith('launch-wizard'):
        new_name = sg['GroupName'].replace('launch-wizard', 'new-name')
        # Rename the security group
        client.update_security_group_name_description(GroupId=sg['GroupId'], GroupName=new_name, Description='New Description')
```

6. The above code will rename all the security groups that have a name prefixed with `launch-wizard` to `new-name`. You can also update the description of the security group as per your requirement.

Note: Before deleting or renaming the security group, make sure that it is not being used by any instances or services.
