<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can use the AWS CLI, you need to install it on your system. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all Security Groups: Use the following command to list all the security groups in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query "SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId,GroupName]" --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all security groups along with their Group ID and Group Name.

3. Check Security Group Rules: For each security group, you can check the inbound and outbound rules using the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <Security_Group_ID>
   ```
   Replace `<Security_Group_ID>` with the ID of the security group you want to check. This command will return a JSON output with all the details of the security group, including the inbound and outbound rules.

4. Analyze the Output: Look for the `IpPermissions` and `IpPermissionsEgress` sections in the output. These sections contain the inbound and outbound rules respectively. Check the `FromPort` and `ToPort` values in each rule. If the `FromPort` and `ToPort` values are the same, then the rule is for a single port. If the `FromPort` is less than the `ToPort`, then the rule is for a range of ports. If the range of ports is too wide, then it might be a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install Boto3: Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can configure credentials by using the AWS CLI or by directly creating the credentials file. The default location for the file is `~/.aws/credentials`. At a minimum, the credentials file should specify the access key and secret access key. To specify these for the default profile, you can use the following lines:

```python
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

3. Python Script: Use the following Python script to check the Security Group Port Range in EC2:

```python
import boto3

def check_security_group_port_range():
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
    for security_group in ec2.security_groups.all():
        for permission in security_group.ip_permissions:
            if permission['FromPort'] <= 0 or permission['ToPort'] >= 65535:
                print(f"Security Group {security_group.group_name} has misconfigured port range")

check_security_group_port_range()
```

This script will print out the names of all security groups that have a port range from 0 to 65535, which is considered a misconfiguration as it exposes all ports.

4. Run the Script: Finally, run the script using a Python interpreter. If there are any security groups with misconfigured port ranges, their names will be printed out. If not, nothing will be printed. This will help you detect any misconfigurations in your EC2 security groups.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The remediation steps for Security Group Port Range misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI are as follows:

1. Identify the security group that has the misconfigured port range. You can use the following command to list all the security groups in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups
   ```

2. Once you have identified the security group, use the following command to update the security group and remove the misconfigured port range:

   ```
   aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port <port-range>
   ```

   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group that has the misconfigured port range, and `<port-range>` with the range of ports that need to be removed.

   For example, if the security group ID is `sg-1234567890` and the misconfigured port range is `0-65535`, the command would be:

   ```
   aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-1234567890 --protocol tcp --port 0-65535
   ```

3. Verify that the misconfigured port range has been removed by using the following command to describe the security group:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-id <security-group-id>
   ```

   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group that you updated. Verify that the misconfigured port range is no longer listed in the security group rules.

By following these steps, you can remediate the Security Group Port Range misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the Security Group Port Range misconfiguration in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to identify the security group that has the misconfigured port range. You can do this by using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all the security groups in your account and filter them based on the port range that is misconfigured.

Here's an example code snippet that lists all the security groups in your account and filters them based on a specific port range:

```
import boto3

# Create an EC2 client
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# List all the security groups in your account
response = ec2.describe_security_groups()

# Filter the security groups based on the misconfigured port range
misconfigured_security_groups = []
for sg in response['SecurityGroups']:
    for rule in sg['IpPermissions']:
        if rule['FromPort'] == 22 and rule['ToPort'] == 22:
            misconfigured_security_groups.append(sg['GroupId'])
```

In this example, we are filtering the security groups based on the SSH port (port 22), but you can modify the code to filter based on other port ranges as well.

2. Once you have identified the security groups that have the misconfigured port range, you need to update the security group rules to allow only the required ports. You can do this by using the `authorize_security_group_ingress` and `revoke_security_group_ingress` methods of the `ec2` client.

Here's an example code snippet that updates the security group rules to allow only the required ports:

```
# Update the security group rules to allow only the required ports
for sg_id in misconfigured_security_groups:
    ec2.revoke_security_group_ingress(
        GroupId=sg_id,
        IpPermissions=[
            {
                'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
                'FromPort': 0,
                'ToPort': 65535,
                'IpRanges': [{'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'}]
            },
            {
                'IpProtocol': 'udp',
                'FromPort': 0,
                'ToPort': 65535,
                'IpRanges': [{'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'}]
            }
        ]
    )

    ec2.authorize_security_group_ingress(
        GroupId=sg_id,
        IpPermissions=[
            {
                'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
                'FromPort': 80,
                'ToPort': 80,
                'IpRanges': [{'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'}]
            },
            {
                'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
                'FromPort': 443,
                'ToPort': 443,
                'IpRanges': [{'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'}]
            }
        ]
    )
```

In this example, we are allowing only HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic to the security groups that have the misconfigured port range. You can modify the code to allow other ports as well.

3. Finally, you should verify that the security group rules have been updated correctly. You can do this by using the `describe_security_groups` method of the `ec2` client to retrieve the security group rules and checking that only the required ports are allowed.

Here's an example code snippet that verifies the updated security group rules:

```
# Verify that the security group rules have been updated correctly
for sg_id in misconfigured_security_groups:
    response = ec2.describe_security_groups(GroupIds=[sg_id])
    for rule in response['SecurityGroups'][0]['IpPermissions']:
        if rule['FromPort'] != 80 and rule['ToPort'] != 443:
            print(f"Security group {sg_id} still has misconfigured port range")
```

In this example, we are checking that only HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic is allowed in the security groups that have the misconfigured port range. If any other port is still allowed, the code will print a message indicating that the security group still has a misconfigured port range.
