1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Systems Manager home page.

2. In the navigation pane, choose Session Manager. This will open the Session Manager dashboard.

3. In the Session Manager dashboard, select Preferences from the left-hand side menu. This will open the Preferences page where you can view and edit your Session Manager preferences.

4. In the Preferences page, look for the Session expiration field. This field indicates the maximum length of time that a session can remain active. If the session length is not set to a minimum (as per your organization's security policy), then it is a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all SSM documents: You can list all the SSM documents in your AWS account by running the following command:
   ```
   aws ssm list-documents
   ```
   This command will return a list of all SSM documents along with their details.

3. Describe SSM document: To check the session length of a specific SSM document, you need to describe it using the following command:
   ```
   aws ssm describe-document --name "document-name"
   ```
   Replace "document-name" with the name of the SSM document you want to check. This command will return the details of the specified SSM document.

4. Check Session Length: In the output of the previous command, look for the "SessionDuration" field. This field indicates the maximum length of time that a session can run on the specified SSM document. If the value of this field is less than the minimum required session length, then it indicates a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. Boto3 allows you to directly create, update, and delete AWS services from your Python scripts.

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS using your access keys.

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Use the `describe_instances` method to get a list of all EC2 instances. Then, for each instance, use the `describe_instance_attribute` method to get the `UserData` attribute, which contains the SSM session length.

```python
ec2 = session.resource('ec2')

for instance in ec2.instances.all():
    response = ec2.describe_instance_attribute(
        InstanceId=instance.id,
        Attribute='userData'
    )
    ssm_session_length = response['UserData']
    print(f'Instance ID: {instance.id}, SSM Session Length: {ssm_session_length}')
```

4. Now, you can check if the SSM session length is less than the minimum required length. If it is, print a warning message.

```python
min_length = 60  # replace with your minimum required length

for instance in ec2.instances.all():
    response = ec2.describe_instance_attribute(
        InstanceId=instance.id,
        Attribute='userData'
    )
    ssm_session_length = response['UserData']
    if ssm_session_length < min_length:
        print(f'WARNING: Instance {instance.id} has SSM session length {ssm_session_length}, which is less than the minimum required length {min_length}.')
```

Please note that you need to replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'`, `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'`, and `'us-west-2'` with your actual AWS access key, secret key, and region respectively. Also, replace `60` with your actual minimum required SSM session length.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of SSM Session Length Should Be Minimum in AWS using AWS console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to your AWS console.
2. Go to the AWS Systems Manager console.
3. Click on the 'Managed Instances' option from the left navigation pane.
4. Select the instance for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.
5. Click on the 'Actions' button and select 'Edit Managed Instance Settings'.
6. In the 'Edit Managed Instance Settings' page, scroll down to the 'SSM Agent Settings' section.
7. In the 'SSM Session Length' field, enter the minimum session length you want to set.
8. Click on the 'Save Changes' button.

Once you have followed the above steps, the SSM Session Length will be set to the minimum value you have specified. This will help you remediate the misconfiguration of SSM Session Length Should Be Minimum in AWS.

#
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The SSM Session Length should be set to a minimum for security reasons. To remediate this for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to update the SSM Document:

```
aws ssm update-document --name "AWS-StartSSHSession" --content "{\"schemaVersion\":\"1.0\",\"description\":\"AWS Systems Manager document to start an SSH session to an instance\",\"parameters\":{\"portNumber\":{\"type\":\"String\",\"description\":\"The port number on which the SSH service is listening (usually 22)\",\"default\":\"22\"},\"sessionLength\":{\"type\":\"String\",\"description\":\"The duration of the session (in seconds)\",\"default\":\"3600\"}},\"mainSteps\":[{\"action\":\"aws:runShellScript\",\"name\":\"runShellScript\",\"inputs\":{\"runCommand\":[\"sudo sed -i 's/\\#   ClientAliveInterval 0/ClientAliveInterval 300/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\",\"sudo sed -i 's/\\#   ClientAliveCountMax 3/ClientAliveCountMax 0/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\",\"sudo service sshd restart\"]}}]}"
```

2. This command will update the SSM Document with a new session length of 3600 seconds (1 hour). If you want to set a different session length, change the value of the `sessionLength` parameter in the command.

3. After the SSM Document is updated, you can use it to start an SSH session to an instance with the new session length. To start an SSH session, run the following command:

```
aws ssm start-session --target instance-id --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters '{"portNumber":["22"],"sessionLength":["3600"]}'
```

4. Replace `instance-id` with the ID of the instance you want to connect to.

5. This command will start an SSH session with a session length of 3600 seconds (1 hour). If you want to set a different session length, change the value of the `sessionLength` parameter in the command.

6. After the SSH session is started, you can use it to perform any necessary actions on the instance.

By following these steps, you can remediate the SSM Session Length misconfiguration in AWS.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of SSM session length being minimum in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.

2. Select the instance for which you want to remediate the SSM session length.

3. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Instance Settings" and then "Modify IAM Role".

4. In the "Modify IAM Role" window, select the IAM role that has the required permissions to modify the SSM session length.

5. Once you have selected the IAM role, click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

6. Now, open your Python IDE and import the required libraries.

```python
import boto3
```

7. Create a boto3 session object and specify the region where your instance is located.

```python
session = boto3.Session(region_name='us-east-1')
```

8. Create an SSM client object using the session object.

```python
ssm_client = session.client('ssm')
```

9. Use the modify_instance_information() method to modify the SSM session length.

```python
response = ssm_client.modify_instance_information(
    InstanceId='instance-id',
    InstanceInformation={
        'SSMActivationId': 'activation-id',
        'SSMActivationCode': 'activation-code',
        'AgentVersion': 'LATEST',
        'PingStatus': 'Online',
        'PlatformType': 'Linux',
        'PlatformName': 'Amazon Linux AMI',
        'PlatformVersion': '2018.03',
        'HostName': 'ec2-xx-xx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com',
        'IPAddress': 'xx.xx.xxx.xxx',
        'ComputerName': 'ip-xx-xx-xxx-xxx',
        'AssociationStatus': 'Success',
        'LastAssociationExecutionDate': datetime(2019, 11, 22, 0, 0, tzinfo=tzlocal()),
        'LastSuccessfulAssociationExecutionDate': datetime(2019, 11, 22, 0, 0, tzinfo=tzlocal()),
        'AssociationOverview': {
            'DetailedStatus': 'Success',
            'InstanceAssociationStatusAggregatedCount': {
                'Failed': 0,
                'InProgress': 0,
                'Success': 1,
                'TimedOut': 0,
                'NoStatus': 0
            }
        }
    },
    DesiredInstanceInformation={
        'SsmSessionDurationSeconds': 3600
    }
)
```

10. In the above code, replace the 'instance-id' with the ID of your instance and 'activation-id' and 'activation-code' with the activation ID and activation code of your SSM agent.

11. Also, modify the 'SsmSessionDurationSeconds' according to your requirement.

Once you execute the above code, it will remediate the SSM session length misconfiguration for your AWS instance.
