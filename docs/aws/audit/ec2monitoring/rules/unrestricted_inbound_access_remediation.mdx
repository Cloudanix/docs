1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the left navigation pane, under the "Network & Security" section, click on "Security Groups".
3. In the Security Groups page, you will see a list of all security groups associated with your EC2 instances. Click on the security group ID that you want to inspect.
4. In the details pane at the bottom, click on the "Inbound rules" tab. Here, you can see all the inbound rules associated with the selected security group. Check for any rules that allow unrestricted inbound access (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 in the source) on uncommon ports (i.e., ports other than 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH, etc.). If such rules exist, it indicates a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all security groups: Use the following command to list all the security groups in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query "SecurityGroups[*].{Name:GroupName,ID:GroupId}"
   ```
   This command will return a list of all security groups along with their names and IDs.

3. Check inbound rules for each security group: For each security group, you need to check the inbound rules to see if there are any rules that allow unrestricted inbound access on all uncommon ports. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query 'SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions[*]'
   ```
   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group you want to check. This command will return a list of all inbound rules for the specified security group.

4. Analyze the output: The output of the previous command will include information about the IP ranges (IPRanges), protocols (IpProtocol), and port ranges (FromPort, ToPort) for each inbound rule. You need to analyze this output to identify any rules that allow unrestricted inbound access on all uncommon ports. Uncommon ports are typically those outside the range of 0-1023. If the IpProtocol is set to "-1" (all), and the IPRanges includes "0.0.0.0/0" (all IP addresses), and the FromPort and ToPort cover the range of uncommon ports, then the security group allows unrestricted inbound access on all uncommon ports.

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3, AWS EC2, and more. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```
Then, configure your AWS credentials:

```python
aws configure
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and create a session using your credentials:

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import BotoCoreError, ClientError

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION_NAME'
)
```

3. Create an EC2 resource object using the session and get all the security groups:

```python
ec2 = session.resource('ec2')
security_groups = ec2.security_groups.all()
```

4. Iterate over all the security groups and their rules to check if there are any rules that allow unrestricted inbound access on all uncommon ports:

```python
for security_group in security_groups:
    for rule in security_group.ip_permissions:
        # Check if the rule allows inbound traffic
        if rule['IpProtocol'] != '-1':
            # Check if the rule allows traffic from all IPs
            for ip_range in rule['IpRanges']:
                if ip_range['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                    # Check if the rule allows traffic on all uncommon ports
                    if rule['FromPort'] < 1024 or rule['FromPort'] > 49151:
                        print(f"Security group {security_group.id} allows unrestricted inbound access on uncommon port {rule['FromPort']}")
```

This script will print the IDs of all security groups that allow unrestricted inbound access on all uncommon ports.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of unrestricted inbound access on all uncommon ports in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Identify the security group that has unrestricted inbound access on all uncommon ports.

2. Use the AWS CLI command to update the security group to restrict inbound access.

3. Verify that the security group is updated successfully.

The following is a step-by-step guide on how to remediate the misconfiguration:

Step 1: Identify the security group that has unrestricted inbound access on all uncommon ports.

You can use the AWS CLI command to list all the security groups in your AWS account:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups
```

This command will list all the security groups in your AWS account along with their details.

Identify the security group that has unrestricted inbound access on all uncommon ports. You can identify it by checking the inbound rules of each security group.

Step 2: Use the AWS CLI command to update the security group to restrict inbound access.

Once you have identified the security group that has unrestricted inbound access on all uncommon ports, you can use the following AWS CLI command to update the security group to restrict inbound access:

```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port <port-range> --cidr <ip-address>
```

Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group that you want to update, `<port-range>` with the port range that you want to restrict, and `<ip-address>` with the IP address range that you want to restrict.

For example, if you want to restrict inbound access to port 22 (SSH) for the security group with ID `sg-0123456789abcdef0`, you can use the following command:

```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-0123456789abcdef0 --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

This command will revoke the inbound rule that allows unrestricted access to port 22 for all IP addresses.

Step 3: Verify that the security group is updated successfully.

You can use the following AWS CLI command to describe the security group and verify that the inbound rule is revoked successfully:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>
```

Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group that you updated.

This command will describe the security group and show the inbound rules for the security group. Verify that the inbound rule that allows unrestricted access to the uncommon port is revoked successfully.

Repeat the above steps for all the security groups that have unrestricted inbound access on uncommon ports.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of unrestricted inbound access on all uncommon ports in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Install the Boto3 library for Python using the following command:

```python
!pip install boto3
```

Step 2: Create an AWS session using the following code:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='REGION_NAME'
)
```

Step 3: Get the list of all security groups in your AWS account using the following code:

```python
ec2_client = session.client('ec2')
response = ec2_client.describe_security_groups()
```

Step 4: Loop through all the security groups and check if they have any inbound rules with port numbers other than the common ports (e.g., 80, 443, 22, etc.). If any such rules are found, delete them using the following code:

```python
for sg in response['SecurityGroups']:
    for rule in sg['IpPermissions']:
        if 'FromPort' in rule and 'ToPort' in rule:
            if rule['FromPort'] not in [80, 443, 22] and rule['ToPort'] not in [80, 443, 22]:
                ec2_client.revoke_security_group_ingress(
                    GroupId=sg['GroupId'],
                    IpPermissions=[rule]
                )
```

Step 5: Once all the security groups have been checked and updated, print a message indicating that the remediation process is complete:

```python
print("Security group remediation complete!")
```

Overall, the above steps will help remediate the misconfiguration of unrestricted inbound access on all uncommon ports in AWS using Python.
