### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under NETWORK & SECURITY, click on "Security Groups".
3. Select the security group that you want to check. In the details pane below, click on the "Inbound rules" tab to view the inbound rules associated with the security group.
4. Check if there is any rule that allows all inbound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to all ports (0 - 65535). If such a rule exists, it means that the Network Firewall Deletion Protection is not enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all the security groups: Use the following command to list all the security groups in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query "SecurityGroups[*].{Name:GroupName,ID:GroupId}"
   ```

3. Check the inbound rules for each security group: For each security group, you need to check the inbound rules to see if they allow unrestricted access. You can do this by running the following command for each security group.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query "SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions[*]"
   ```

4. Analyze the output: The output of the above command will give you the details of the inbound rules for the specified security group. If the IpRanges field contains 0.0.0.0/0, it means that the security group allows unrestricted access. If the IpProtocol field is -1, it means that all protocols are allowed. If both these conditions are true for any security group, it means that the Network Firewall Deletion Protection is not enabled for that security group.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You can set up your AWS credentials in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI's configure command:

```bash
aws configure
```

3. Create a Python script to check Network Firewall Deletion Protection: 

```python
import boto3

def check_firewall_deletion_protection():
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    response = ec2.describe_network_interfaces()
    for network_interface in response['NetworkInterfaces']:
        if 'Association' in network_interface:
            if 'IpOwnerId' in network_interface['Association']:
                if network_interface['Association']['IpOwnerId'] == 'amazon':
                    print("Network Firewall Deletion Protection is enabled")
                else:
                    print("Network Firewall Deletion Protection is not enabled")
            else:
                print("Network Firewall Deletion Protection is not enabled")
        else:
            print("Network Firewall Deletion Protection is not enabled")

check_firewall_deletion_protection()
```

4. Run the Python script: You can run the Python script using any Python interpreter. The script will print whether Network Firewall Deletion Protection is enabled or not for each network interface in your AWS account.

Please note that this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to call the describe_network_interfaces operation. If you don't, you'll need to adjust your IAM policies accordingly.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of Network Firewall Deletion Protection not being enabled for AWS EC2 using the AWS console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console and login to your account.

2. **Navigate to EC2 Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top left corner and select "EC2" under the Compute section.

3. **Select Security Groups**: In the EC2 dashboard, click on the "Security Groups" option from the left-hand side menu.

4. **Select the Security Group**: Identify the security group that you want to enable deletion protection for and click on it to select it.

5. **Enable Deletion Protection**: In the security group details page, go to the "Actions" dropdown menu at the top and select "Edit inbound rules" or "Edit outbound rules" as per your requirement.

6. **Enable Deletion Protection**: In the Edit rules page, scroll down to the bottom and locate the "Delete Protection" option. Check the box next to "Protect against accidental deletion" to enable deletion protection for the security group.

7. **Save Changes**: After enabling deletion protection, click on the "Save rules" button to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you have successfully enabled deletion protection for the selected security group in AWS EC2 using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Network Firewall Deletion Protection not being enabled for AWS EC2 instances using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. List all the security groups associated with your EC2 instances to identify the security group that needs to have deletion protection enabled:
```
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId,GroupName]'
```

2. Enable deletion protection for the identified security group using the following command. Replace `<security-group-id>` with the actual Security Group ID:
```
aws ec2 modify-security-group-rules --group-id <security-group-id> --no-delete-on-revoke
```

3. Verify that deletion protection has been enabled for the security group by describing the security group attributes:
```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id> --query 'SecurityGroups[*].{GroupName:GroupName,DeletionProtection:DeletionProtection}'
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Network Firewall Deletion Protection not being enabled for AWS EC2 instances using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Network Firewall Deletion Protection not being enabled for AWS EC2 instances using Python, you can use the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here are the step-by-step instructions to enable deletion protection for network firewalls associated with EC2 instances:

1. Install Boto3 library:
   Ensure you have the Boto3 library installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Write a Python script to enable deletion protection for network firewalls:
   Create a Python script (e.g., `enable_firewall_deletion_protection.py`) with the following code:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize the EC2 client
   ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

   # Get all the network interfaces associated with EC2 instances
   response = ec2_client.describe_instances()
   for reservation in response['Reservations']:
       for instance in reservation['Instances']:
           for interface in instance['NetworkInterfaces']:
               # Get the network interface ID
               network_interface_id = interface['NetworkInterfaceId']
               
               # Enable deletion protection for the network interface
               ec2_client.modify_network_interface_attribute(
                   NetworkInterfaceId=network_interface_id,
                   DeletionProtection={'Value': True}
               )
               print(f"Deletion protection enabled for network interface {network_interface_id}")
   ```

3. Configure AWS credentials:
   Ensure that your AWS credentials are configured either through environment variables, AWS CLI configuration, or IAM roles.

4. Run the Python script:
   Execute the Python script using the following command:
   ```
   python enable_firewall_deletion_protection.py
   ```

By following these steps, you can use Python and Boto3 to enable deletion protection for network firewalls associated with EC2 instances in AWS, thereby remediating the misconfiguration.
