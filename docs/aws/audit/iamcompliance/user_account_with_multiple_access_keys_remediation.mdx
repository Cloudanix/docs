How to deactivate any unnecessary Amazon IAM access keys?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the navigation panel, under Access management, choose Users.

- Step 2: Click on the name (link) of the IAM user that you want to reconfigure. Select the Security credentials tab to access the configuration information available for the IAM user credentials.

- Step 3: In the Access keys section, perform the following actions:
  A: Choose the IAM access key that will be used to provide access to your AWS cloud resources, and update your application(s) code to use only the chosen key pair. Test your application(s) to make sure that the chosen IAM access key is working.
  B: Identify the non-operational IAM access key (other than the one chosen at the previous step) and deactivate the key pair by choosing Make inactive.
  C: In the Deactivate access-key-id confirmation box, choose to Deactivate to decommission the selected key.
