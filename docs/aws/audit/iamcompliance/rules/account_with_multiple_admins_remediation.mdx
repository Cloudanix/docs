### Remediation

How to remediate AWS Accounts with multiple admins?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Review Existing Admin Users:
   - Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.
   - Go to the "Users" section and review the list of existing users with admin privileges.
   - Identify the users who have unnecessary or excessive admin access.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "AWS Account Should Not Have Too Many Admins" Policy.)
2. Implement the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP):
   - Create IAM Policies: 
     - Identify the specific permissions required for each admin user based on their responsibilities.
     - Create IAM policies that grant only the necessary permissions needed to perform their tasks.
     - Avoid using the built-in "AdministratorAccess" policy and instead define granular policies.
   - Create IAM Groups: 
     - Group admin users based on their roles or responsibilities.
     - Assign the appropriate IAM policies to each group.
   - Remove Unnecessary Admin Access:
     - Remove admin privileges from users who do not require them.
     - Revoke the "AdministratorAccess" policy from users who have it.
