### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". This will display a list of all IAM users that are currently created for your AWS account.

3. For each user, under the "Permissions" tab, check the attached policies. If a user has "AdministratorAccess" or any other policy that grants full access to AWS services, they are considered as an admin.

4. Count the number of such admin users. If the number exceeds the recommended limit (which may vary depending on the organization's size and needs), it indicates a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all IAM users: Use the AWS CLI command `aws iam list-users` to list all the IAM users in your AWS account. This command will return a JSON object that contains all the IAM users.

3. List all IAM policies: Use the AWS CLI command `aws iam list-policies` to list all the IAM policies in your AWS account. This command will return a JSON object that contains all the IAM policies.

4. Check for admin policies: For each IAM user, use the AWS CLI command `aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name <username>` to list all the policies attached to that user. Replace `<username>` with the name of the IAM user. This command will return a JSON object that contains all the policies attached to the user. Look for policies that grant admin privileges, such as `AdministratorAccess`. If there are too many users with such policies, it indicates that your AWS account has too many admins.

#### Using Python

1. First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3` in your terminal.

2. Once Boto3 is installed, you can use it to interact with AWS services. To check for too many admins in IAM, you would first need to create a client for IAM. Here is a sample script:

```python
import boto3

# Create IAM client
iam = boto3.client('iam')

# List all users
response = iam.list_users()

# Initialize counter for admins
admin_count = 0

# Iterate over all users
for user in response['Users']:
    # Get user policies
    user_policies = iam.list_attached_user_policies(UserName=user['UserName'])

    # Check if user has admin policy
    for policy in user_policies['AttachedPolicies']:
        if policy['PolicyName'] == 'AdministratorAccess':
            admin_count += 1

# Print number of admins
print(f'Number of admins: {admin_count}')
```

3. This script will list all the users in your AWS account and check if they have the 'AdministratorAccess' policy attached. If they do, it increments a counter. At the end, it prints the total number of admins.

4. You can then decide what constitutes "too many" admins. If the number printed by the script is higher than your threshold, you have a misconfiguration. This threshold will depend on your specific needs and security policies.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

The following are the step by step instructions to remediate the AWS misconfiguration:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console using your administrator credentials.
2. Navigate to the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) dashboard.
3. Click on the "Users" option in the left-hand menu.
4. Review the list of users and identify any users with the "AdministratorAccess" policy attached to their account.
5. Select the user(s) that you want to remove the "AdministratorAccess" policy from.
6. Click on the "Permissions" tab.
7. Click on the "Detach Policy" button next to the "AdministratorAccess" policy.
8. Confirm the action by clicking on the "Detach" button.
9. Repeat steps 5-8 for any additional users with the "AdministratorAccess" policy attached to their account.
10. Create a new IAM group with the necessary permissions for the users that no longer have "AdministratorAccess" policy attached to their account.
11. Add the users to the new group.
12. Monitor the IAM dashboard to ensure that no new users are granted the "AdministratorAccess" policy.

By following these steps, you can remediate the AWS misconfiguration by reducing the number of users with "AdministratorAccess" policy attached to their accounts, and providing them with only the necessary permissions to perform their job duties.

#### Using CLI

Step-by-Step Instructions to remediate the AWS misconfiguration "AWS Account Should Not Have Too Many Admins" using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the number of IAM users with admin access in your AWS account:
   
   Run the following AWS CLI command to list all the IAM users with admin access:
   
   ```
   aws iam list-users --query 'Users[?join(``,`[`,{AccessKeyMetadata:AccessKeys}[?Status==`Active`].AccessKeyId,`]`)]' --output table
   ```
   
   This command will list all the IAM users with their Access Key IDs in a table format. Review the output and count the number of users with admin access.
   
2. Create a new IAM group with limited permissions:
   
   Run the following AWS CLI command to create a new IAM group with limited permissions:
   
   ```
   aws iam create-group --group-name <group-name>
   ```
   
   Replace `<group-name>` with a name for the new IAM group. This group will have limited permissions and will not have admin access.
   
3. Remove admin access from the IAM users:
   
   Run the following AWS CLI command to remove admin access from the IAM users:
   
   ```
   aws iam remove-user-from-group --group-name admin --user-name <user-name>
   ```
   
   Replace `<user-name>` with the name of the IAM user you want to remove from the admin group. Repeat this command for each IAM user with admin access.
   
4. Add the IAM users to the new IAM group:
   
   Run the following AWS CLI command to add the IAM users to the new IAM group:
   
   ```
   aws iam add-user-to-group --group-name <group-name> --user-name <user-name>
   ```
   
   Replace `<group-name>` with the name of the new IAM group and `<user-name>` with the name of the IAM user you want to add to the group. Repeat this command for each IAM user you want to add to the group.
   
5. Verify the changes:
   
   Run the following AWS CLI command to verify that the IAM users no longer have admin access:
   
   ```
   aws iam list-groups-for-user --user-name <user-name> --query 'Groups[].GroupName' --output table
   ```
   
   Replace `<user-name>` with the name of an IAM user you removed from the admin group. This command will list all the IAM groups that the user belongs to. Verify that the user is not in the admin group anymore and is only in the new group with limited permissions.
   
   Repeat this command for each IAM user you removed from the admin group.
   
6. Delete the admin IAM group:
   
   Run the following AWS CLI command to delete the admin IAM group:
   
   ```
   aws iam delete-group --group-name admin
   ```
   
   This will delete the admin IAM group and remove all the IAM users from it.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of having too many admins in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Identify the IAM users with admin privileges:
   - Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all the IAM users in the account.
   - For each user, check if they have the "AdministratorAccess" policy attached to their IAM user or group.
   - If they do, add their username to a list of users with admin privileges.

Here is the sample code to identify the IAM users with admin privileges:

```
import boto3

# Create an IAM client
iam = boto3.client('iam')

# List all the IAM users in the account
response = iam.list_users()

# Initialize an empty list to store the usernames with admin privileges
admins = []

# Check each user for the "AdministratorAccess" policy
for user in response['Users']:
    response = iam.list_attached_user_policies(UserName=user['UserName'])
    for policy in response['AttachedPolicies']:
        if policy['PolicyName'] == 'AdministratorAccess':
            admins.append(user['UserName'])

print("Users with admin privileges: ", admins)
```

2. Remove the admin privileges from the identified users:
   - For each user in the list of admins, remove the "AdministratorAccess" policy from their IAM user or group.
   - Alternatively, you can create a new IAM policy with limited permissions and attach it to these users instead of the "AdministratorAccess" policy.

Here is the sample code to remove the "AdministratorAccess" policy from the identified users:

```
import boto3

# Create an IAM client
iam = boto3.client('iam')

# List all the IAM users in the account
response = iam.list_users()

# Initialize an empty list to store the usernames with admin privileges
admins = []

# Check each user for the "AdministratorAccess" policy
for user in response['Users']:
    response = iam.list_attached_user_policies(UserName=user['UserName'])
    for policy in response['AttachedPolicies']:
        if policy['PolicyName'] == 'AdministratorAccess':
            admins.append(user['UserName'])

# Remove the "AdministratorAccess" policy from the identified users
for admin in admins:
    response = iam.list_attached_user_policies(UserName=admin)
    for policy in response['AttachedPolicies']:
        if policy['PolicyName'] == 'AdministratorAccess':
            iam.detach_user_policy(UserName=admin, PolicyArn=policy['PolicyArn'])

print("Admin privileges removed from users: ", admins)
```

Note: Before running the above code, make sure you have the necessary AWS credentials configured on your system.
