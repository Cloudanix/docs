How to terminate inactive IAM users and their ability to access AWS resources through the Management Console?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using an account with administrative privileges.
2. Open the IAM console by navigating to the IAM service.
3. In the navigation pane, click on "Users" to view the list of IAM users in your account.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "User Console Access Inactive" Policy.)
4. Identify the IAM user(s) that you want to terminate due to inactivity.
5. Select the checkbox next to the IAM user's name to activate the actions menu.
6. Click on the "Security credentials" tab in the user details view.
7. In the "Console password" section, click on the "Make inactive" link next to the password. This will deactivate the user's ability to sign in to the AWS Management Console using a password.
8. Next, in the "Access keys" section, identify and make inactive any access keys associated with the user by clicking on the "Make inactive" link next to each unused key. This will deactivate the access keys.
9. Once you have deactivated the password and access keys, go back to the IAM users list.
10. Select the checkbox next to the IAM user(s) you want to terminate.
11. Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and choose "Delete users".
12. Confirm the action when prompted to delete the user(s).
