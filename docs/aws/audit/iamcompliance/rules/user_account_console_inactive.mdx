1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". This will display a list of all IAM users in your account.

3. For each user, check the "Last activity" column. This column shows the time when the user last accessed the AWS Management Console, used the AWS CLI, or made a programmatic request to AWS.

4. If the "Last activity" column shows "None" or a date that is older than your organization's inactivity threshold, then the user console access is inactive.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation: `pip install awscli`
   
   Configuration: `aws configure`

2. List all IAM users: Use the `list-users` command to get a list of all IAM users in your AWS account. The command is as follows:

   `aws iam list-users`

3. Get login profile for each user: For each user, you need to check if they have a login profile. A login profile is required for a user to login to the AWS Management Console. You can do this by running the `get-login-profile` command for each user:

   `aws iam get-login-profile --user-name <username>`

4. Check last used password: For each user with a login profile, you need to check when they last used their password to login to the AWS Management Console. You can do this by running the `get-user` command:

   `aws iam get-user --user-name <username>`

   In the output, look for the `PasswordLastUsed` field. If this field is not present or the date is older than your organization's inactivity threshold, the user console access is inactive.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the Boto3 library. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials: Before you can interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a file at ~/.aws/credentials. At the very least, the contents of the file should be:

   ```bash
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Create a Python script: The following Python script uses the Boto3 library to interact with AWS IAM service. It lists all the IAM users and checks if they have console access. If they do, it checks when they last used it. If it's more than 90 days, it prints the username.

   ```python
   import boto3
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   def check_inactive_users():
       client = boto3.client('iam')
       users = client.list_users()
       for user in users['Users']:
           username = user['UserName']
           login_profile = client.get_login_profile(UserName=username)
           if 'LoginProfile' in login_profile:
               last_used = client.get_user(UserName=username)['User']['PasswordLastUsed']
               if last_used < datetime.now() - timedelta(days=90):
                   print(username)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_inactive_users()
   ```

4. Run the Python script: You can run the Python script from your terminal using the following command:

   ```bash
   python check_inactive_users.py
   ```
   
This script will print the usernames of all IAM users who have console access but haven't used it in the last 90 days.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the "User Console Access Inactive" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS Console, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console using your root account credentials.
2. Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) dashboard.
3. Click on the "Users" tab in the left-hand navigation menu.
4. Select the user whose console access is inactive.
5. Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
6. Under "Console password," click "Enable" to enable console access for the user.
7. Follow the prompts to set a new password for the user.
8. Click "Apply" to save the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, the user should now have console access to the AWS Management Console.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the "User Console Access Inactive" misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.
3. Run the following command to enable the user console access:

```
aws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 8 --require-symbols --require-numbers --require-uppercase-characters --require-lowercase-characters --allow-users-to-change-password
```

This command will update the account password policy to require a minimum password length of 8 characters, and to require symbols, numbers, uppercase and lowercase characters. It will also allow users to change their passwords.

4. Verify that the user console access is now active by logging in to the AWS Management Console with your IAM user credentials.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the "User Console Access Inactive" misconfiguration in AWS.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of "User Console Access Inactive" in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK libraries and modules in your Python script. You can use the `boto3` library to interact with AWS services.

2. Create an AWS IAM client object using the `boto3.client()` method. This client object will allow you to interact with the IAM service in AWS.

```
import boto3

# Create an IAM client
iam = boto3.client('iam')
```

3. Use the `iam.update_account_password_policy()` method to update the account password policy to enable user console access. Set the `AllowUsersToChangePassword` parameter to `True` and the `MinimumPasswordLength` parameter to a value of your choice (e.g. 8).

```
# Update the account password policy
response = iam.update_account_password_policy(
    AllowUsersToChangePassword=True,
    MinimumPasswordLength=8
)
```

4. Verify that the account password policy has been updated successfully by checking the response from the `update_account_password_policy()` method.

```
# Check the response
if response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode'] == 200:
    print("Account password policy updated successfully.")
else:
    print("Error updating account password policy.")
```

5. Run the Python script to remediate the misconfiguration of "User Console Access Inactive" in AWS.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary AWS credentials configured in your environment before running the script.
