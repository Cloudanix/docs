### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent user accounts from having multiple access keys in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to IAM Dashboard:**
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Open the IAM (Identity and Access Management) dashboard by selecting "IAM" from the services menu.

2. **Access User Details:**
   - In the IAM dashboard, select "Users" from the left-hand navigation pane.
   - Click on the username of the user you want to manage.

3. **Review Access Keys:**
   - In the user details page, select the "Security credentials" tab.
   - Under the "Access keys" section, review the list of access keys associated with the user.

4. **Enforce Single Access Key Policy:**
   - Ensure that each user has only one active access key.
   - If a user has multiple access keys, consider implementing a policy or standard operating procedure (SOP) that restricts the creation of multiple access keys per user.
   - Educate users and administrators on the importance of maintaining a single access key for security and management purposes.

By following these steps, you can help prevent the misconfiguration of user accounts having multiple access keys in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent a user account from having multiple access keys in AWS IAM using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a New IAM User Without Access Keys:**
   Ensure that when you create a new IAM user, you do not create multiple access keys for them. Use the following command to create a new IAM user without any access keys:
   ```sh
   aws iam create-user --user-name NewUserName
   ```

2. **Attach Policies to the User:**
   Attach the necessary policies to the user without creating multiple access keys. For example, to attach the `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` policy:
   ```sh
   aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name NewUserName --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
   ```

3. **Monitor and List Access Keys:**
   Regularly monitor and list the access keys for each user to ensure they do not have multiple access keys. Use the following command to list access keys for a specific user:
   ```sh
   aws iam list-access-keys --user-name ExistingUserName
   ```

4. **Enforce Policy to Restrict Multiple Access Keys:**
   Create and attach an IAM policy that restricts users from creating multiple access keys. This can be done by defining a policy that denies the `iam:CreateAccessKey` action if the user already has an active access key. Here is an example of such a policy:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Deny",
         "Action": "iam:CreateAccessKey",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:user/${aws:username}",
         "Condition": {
           "NumericGreaterThan": {
             "aws:RequestTag/AccessKeyCount": "1"
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   Attach this policy to the users or groups as needed:
   ```sh
   aws iam put-user-policy --user-name ExistingUserName --policy-name RestrictMultipleAccessKeys --policy-document file://policy.json
   ```

By following these steps, you can prevent IAM users from having multiple access keys using the AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent a user account from having multiple access keys in IAM using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK (Boto3) for Python**:
   - Ensure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
     ```bash
     pip install boto3
     ```

2. **Create a Python Script to List Access Keys**:
   - Write a Python script to list all access keys for a given IAM user. This will help you identify if a user has multiple access keys.
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon IAM
   session = boto3.Session(profile_name='your_profile_name')
   iam_client = session.client('iam')

   # Function to list access keys for a user
   def list_access_keys(user_name):
       response = iam_client.list_access_keys(UserName=user_name)
       return response['AccessKeyMetadata']

   # Example usage
   user_name = 'your_iam_user_name'
   access_keys = list_access_keys(user_name)
   print(f"Access keys for user {user_name}: {access_keys}")
   ```

3. **Check for Multiple Access Keys**:
   - Extend the script to check if a user has more than one access key and print a warning message if they do.
   ```python
   def check_multiple_access_keys(user_name):
       access_keys = list_access_keys(user_name)
       if len(access_keys) > 1:
           print(f"Warning: User {user_name} has multiple access keys.")
       else:
           print(f"User {user_name} has a single access key or none.")

   # Example usage
   check_multiple_access_keys(user_name)
   ```

4. **Automate the Check for All Users**:
   - Automate the process to check all IAM users in your account and ensure none of them have multiple access keys.
   ```python
   def list_all_users():
       response = iam_client.list_users()
       return response['Users']

   def check_all_users_for_multiple_access_keys():
       users = list_all_users()
       for user in users:
           user_name = user['UserName']
           check_multiple_access_keys(user_name)

   # Example usage
   check_all_users_for_multiple_access_keys()
   ```

By following these steps, you can create a Python script that checks for multiple access keys for IAM users and helps prevent this misconfiguration. This script can be run periodically or integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure compliance.

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Users".

3. In the "User Name" list, choose the name of the intended user.

4. In the "User Summary" section, choose the "Security Credentials" tab.

5. Under "Access Keys", check the number of access keys assigned to the user. If there are more than one access keys, then the user account has multiple access keys.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by using the command `pip install awscli`. After installation, you need to configure it using `aws configure` command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List IAM users: Use the following command to list all the IAM users in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws iam list-users
   ```

   This command will return a list of all IAM users in your AWS account.

3. List access keys for each user: For each user, you need to check the number of access keys. You can do this by using the following command:

   ```
   aws iam list-access-keys --user-name <username>
   ```

   Replace `<username>` with the name of the IAM user. This command will return a list of all access keys associated with the specified IAM user.

4. Check the number of access keys: If the number of access keys for a user is more than one, then it is a misconfiguration. You can check this by counting the number of access keys returned by the previous command. If the count is more than one, then the user has multiple access keys.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Now, create a client for IAM and list all the users:

```python
iam = session.client('iam')
users = iam.list_users()['Users']
```

4. For each user, list the access keys and check if there are more than one. If there are, print a warning:

```python
for user in users:
    access_keys = iam.list_access_keys(UserName=user['UserName'])['AccessKeyMetadata']
    if len(access_keys) > 1:
        print(f"Warning: User {user['UserName']} has multiple access keys.")
```

This script will print a warning for each user that has more than one access key. Note that you need to replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your actual AWS credentials.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "User Account Should Not Have Multiple Access Keys" for AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: List all the access keys for the user account using the following command:

```
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name <user-name>
```

Note: Replace `<user-name>` with the actual user name.

Step 2: Identify the unused access keys that need to be deleted.

Step 3: Delete the unused access keys using the following command:

```
aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id <access-key-id> --user-name <user-name>
```

Note: Replace `<access-key-id>` with the actual access key ID and `<user-name>` with the actual user name.

Step 4: Verify that the unused access keys have been deleted by running the command in step 1 again.

Repeat steps 2-4 for all the unused access keys until there is only one access key left for the user account. 

Once you have ensured that there is only one access key for the user account, the misconfiguration "User Account Should Not Have Multiple Access Keys" has been remediated.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of having multiple access keys for a user account in AWS, you can use the following Python script:

```
import boto3

# Set the name of the user whose access keys need to be checked
user_name = 'your_username_here'

# Create a connection to the IAM service
iam = boto3.client('iam')

# Get all the access keys for the user
access_keys = iam.list_access_keys(UserName=user_name)['AccessKeyMetadata']

# If the user has more than one access key, delete all but the most recent one
if len(access_keys) > 1:
    # Sort the access keys by creation date, with the most recent one first
    sorted_keys = sorted(access_keys, key=lambda k: k['CreateDate'], reverse=True)
    # Delete all but the most recent access key
    for key in sorted_keys[1:]:
        iam.delete_access_key(UserName=user_name, AccessKeyId=key['AccessKeyId'])
```

Explanation:

1. The first step is to import the `boto3` library, which is the AWS SDK for Python.

2. Next, we set the name of the user whose access keys need to be checked. Replace 'your_username_here' with the actual username.

3. We create a connection to the IAM service using the `boto3.client` method.

4. We use the `list_access_keys` method to get all the access keys for the user.

5. If the user has more than one access key, we sort the access keys by creation date, with the most recent one first.

6. We then delete all but the most recent access key using the `delete_access_key` method.

Note: This script assumes that you have AWS credentials set up on the machine where you are running the script. If not, you will need to provide credentials in the script or use another method for authentication.
