### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of inactive user account access keys in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS console:

1. Login to the AWS management console using your credentials.

2. Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) dashboard.

3. Click on the "Users" option from the left-hand side menu.

4. Select the user account for which you want to drop the inactive access keys.

5. Click on the "Security Credentials" tab.

6. Under the "Access keys" section, you will see the list of active and inactive access keys associated with the user account.

7. Identify the inactive access keys that you want to drop.

8. Click on the "Make Inactive" button next to the access key that you want to drop.

9. A confirmation message will appear, click on "Yes, Make Inactive" to confirm.

10. The inactive access key will now be dropped, and you can repeat the same process to drop any other inactive access keys associated with the user account.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of inactive user account access keys in AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the IAM users in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws iam list-users
   ```

3. Identify the inactive users from the list. Inactive users are those who have not used their access keys for a long time.

4. Run the following command to list the access keys for an inactive user:

   ```
   aws iam list-access-keys --user-name <user-name>
   ```

   Replace `<user-name>` with the name of the inactive user.

5. Identify the inactive access keys from the list. Inactive access keys are those that have not been used for a long time.

6. Run the following command to delete the inactive access keys:

   ```
   aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id <access-key-id> --user-name <user-name>
   ```

   Replace `<access-key-id>` with the ID of the inactive access key and `<user-name>` with the name of the inactive user.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 for all the inactive users and access keys in your AWS account.

8. Once you have deleted all the inactive access keys, verify that the misconfiguration has been remediated by running a security audit of your AWS account.

Note: Before deleting any access keys, make sure that they are really inactive and not being used by any application or service. Deleting active access keys can result in service disruption.

#### Using Python

To remediate the inactive user account access keys issue in AWS, you can use the following Python script:

1. First, you need to import the necessary modules:

```python
import boto3
import datetime
```

2. Next, you need to create an AWS IAM client:

```python
client = boto3.client('iam')
```

3. Then, you can get a list of all IAM users:

```python
users = client.list_users()['Users']
```

4. For each user, you can get a list of their access keys:

```python
for user in users:
    access_keys = client.list_access_keys(UserName=user['UserName'])['AccessKeyMetadata']
```

5. You can then check the last time each access key was used:

```python
for key in access_keys:
    last_used = client.get_access_key_last_used(AccessKeyId=key['AccessKeyId'])
    if 'LastUsedDate' not in last_used['AccessKeyLastUsed']:
        # Access key has never been used
        client.delete_access_key(UserName=user['UserName'], AccessKeyId=key['AccessKeyId'])
    else:
        last_used_date = last_used['AccessKeyLastUsed']['LastUsedDate']
        days_since_last_used = (datetime.datetime.now() - last_used_date.replace(tzinfo=None)).days
        if days_since_last_used > 90:
            # Access key has not been used in over 90 days
            client.delete_access_key(UserName=user['UserName'], AccessKeyId=key['AccessKeyId'])
```

6. Finally, you can delete any access keys that have not been used in over 90 days or that have never been used.

```python
client.delete_access_key(UserName=user['UserName'], AccessKeyId=key['AccessKeyId'])
```

Note: Before running this script, make sure you have the necessary permissions to manage IAM users and access keys.
