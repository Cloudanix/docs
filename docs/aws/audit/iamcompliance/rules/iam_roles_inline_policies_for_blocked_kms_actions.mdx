1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Policies". This will open a list of all the IAM policies that are currently configured in your AWS environment.

3. Select the policy you want to check for blocked KMS actions. This will open the policy details page.

4. In the policy details page, check the policy document for any "Deny" statements that are applied to KMS actions. If there are any "Deny" statements applied to KMS actions, then the policy is blocking those actions.

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute IAM related commands.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the IAM policies using the following command:
   ```
   aws iam list-policies --scope Local
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the IAM policies that are created within your AWS account.

3. For each policy, you can get the policy details including the policy document by using the following command:
   ```
   aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <Policy_ARN> --version-id <Policy_Version_ID>
   ```
   Replace `<Policy_ARN>` with the ARN of the policy and `<Policy_Version_ID>` with the version ID of the policy. This command will return the policy document which includes the permissions set by the policy.

4. Now, you need to check the policy document for any blocked KMS actions. You can do this by looking for "kms:Deny" statements in the policy document. If you find any such statements, it means that some KMS actions are blocked in the inline policy. You can use a JSON parser or a script to automate this process. For example, in Python, you can use the `json` module to parse the policy document and check for blocked KMS actions.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install and configure Boto3 to interact with AWS services. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials either by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```
   Or, you can create the credential file yourself at ~/.aws/credentials. At a minimum, it should look like this:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

2. Use Boto3 to list all IAM policies:
   You can use the `list_policies` method to retrieve all IAM policies. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # List policies
   response = iam.list_policies(Scope='All')
   for policy in response['Policies']:
       print(policy['PolicyName'])
   ```

3. Get the policy details:
   For each policy, you can use the `get_policy` method to retrieve the policy details, including the policy document. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # Get policy
   response = iam.get_policy(PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess')
   policy_document = response['Policy']['PolicyDocument']
   print(policy_document)
   ```

4. Check for blocked KMS actions:
   You can parse the policy document to check if it contains any blocked KMS actions. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3
   import json

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # Get policy
   response = iam.get_policy(PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess')
   policy_document = response['Policy']['PolicyDocument']

   # Parse policy document
   policy_document = json.loads(policy_document)

   # Check for blocked KMS actions
   for statement in policy_document['Statement']:
       if 'kms:Decrypt' in statement['Action'] and statement['Effect'] == 'Deny':
           print('Blocked KMS action found: kms:Decrypt')
   ```
   This script checks if the 'kms:Decrypt' action is blocked. You can modify it to check for other KMS actions.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Login to AWS Management Console:**
   - Open your web browser and go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/).
   - Enter your credentials to login to the AWS Management Console.

2. **Navigate to IAM Service:**
   - Once you are logged in, navigate to the IAM service by typing "IAM" in the search bar at the top of the AWS Management Console and selecting IAM from the search results.

3. **Locate the User or Role with Inline Policies:**
   - In the IAM dashboard, click on "Users" or "Roles" from the left-hand side menu, depending on whether the inline policy is attached to a user or a role.
   - Search for the user or role that has the inline policy with blocked KMS actions.

4. **Edit Inline Policy:**
   - Click on the user or role name to view its details.
   - Scroll down to the "Permissions" tab and locate the inline policy that contains the blocked KMS actions.
   - Click on the policy name to edit it.

5. **Update the Policy to Allow KMS Actions:**
   - Within the inline policy editor, locate the section that specifies the blocked KMS actions.
   - Update the policy to allow the necessary KMS actions by adding the required permissions. You can refer to the AWS KMS documentation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/) for the list of KMS actions and their corresponding permissions.

6. **Review and Save the Policy:**
   - After updating the inline policy to allow the required KMS actions, review the changes to ensure that the policy is correctly configured.
   - Click on the "Save" button to save the changes to the inline policy.

7. **Verify the Changes:**
   - Once the inline policy is updated and saved, verify that the blocked KMS actions are now allowed for the user or role.
   - You can test the permissions by attempting to perform the KMS actions that were previously blocked.

8. **Monitor for Compliance:**
   - Regularly monitor the IAM policies to ensure that there are no misconfigurations or blocked actions, and address any issues promptly.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the inline policy attached to the IAM user, group, or role that contains the blocked KMS actions. You can use the following AWS CLI command to list the inline policies attached to a specific IAM entity (replace `IAM_ENTITY_NAME` with the actual name of the IAM user, group, or role):

```
aws iam list-user-policies --user-name IAM_ENTITY_NAME
aws iam list-group-policies --group-name IAM_ENTITY_NAME
aws iam list-role-policies --role-name IAM_ENTITY_NAME
```

2. Once you have identified the inline policy that contains the blocked KMS actions, you need to update the policy to allow those actions. You can use the following AWS CLI command to update the inline policy (replace `IAM_ENTITY_NAME` and `POLICY_NAME` with the actual names):

```
aws iam put-user-policy --user-name IAM_ENTITY_NAME --policy-name POLICY_NAME --policy-document file://policy.json
aws iam put-group-policy --group-name IAM_ENTITY_NAME --policy-name POLICY_NAME --policy-document file://policy.json
aws iam put-role-policy --role-name IAM_ENTITY_NAME --policy-name POLICY_NAME --policy-document file://policy.json
```

3. In the `policy.json` file, make sure to include the necessary permissions for the KMS actions that were previously blocked. Here is an example of a policy document that allows the `kms:Encrypt` action for a specific KMS key:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "kms:Encrypt",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:key/KMS_KEY_ID"
        }
    ]
}
```

4. Save the updated policy document in a file (e.g., `policy.json`) and run the AWS CLI command to update the inline policy with the corrected permissions.

5. Verify that the inline policy has been updated successfully by listing the policies again and checking the permissions.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the inline policies attached to IAM users, groups, or roles that contain KMS actions that are blocked.

2. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update the inline policies and allow the necessary KMS actions.

3. Here is a sample Python script that you can use to remediate this issue:

```python
import boto3

# Create an IAM client
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

# List all IAM users, groups, and roles
entities = ['users', 'groups', 'roles']

for entity in entities:
    response = iam_client.list_{}_with_inline_policies()
    
    for entity_info in response['{}_with_inline_policies'.format(entity)]:
        # Get the inline policies attached to the entity
        policies = entity_info['inline_policies']
        
        for policy_name, policy_details in policies.items():
            # Check if the policy contains blocked KMS actions
            if 'kms' in policy_details['PolicyDocument']:
                # Update the policy to allow necessary KMS actions
                updated_policy = {
                    'Version': '2012-10-17',
                    'Statement': [{
                        'Effect': 'Allow',
                        'Action': [
                            'kms:Encrypt',
                            'kms:Decrypt',
                            'kms:ReEncrypt*',
                            'kms:GenerateDataKey*',
                            'kms:DescribeKey'
                        ],
                        'Resource': '*'
                    }]
                }
                
                # Update the inline policy
                iam_client.put_user_policy(
                    UserName=entity_info['UserName'],
                    PolicyName=policy_name,
                    PolicyDocument=json.dumps(updated_policy)
                )

print('KMS actions in inline policies have been remediated.')
```

4. Make sure to customize the script according to your specific requirements and IAM setup.

5. Run the script in your AWS environment to update the inline policies and allow the necessary KMS actions.

By following these steps and executing the Python script, you can remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM.
