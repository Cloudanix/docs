To remediate the "Blocked KMS Actions In Inline Policies Should Be Set" misconfiguration in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and login to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to IAM Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown in the top left corner and select "IAM" under the Security, Identity, & Compliance section.

3. **Select the User/Role/Group**: In the left-hand navigation pane, choose the appropriate option (User, Role, or Group) where the inline policy with blocked KMS actions exists.

4. **Locate the Inline Policy**: Scroll down to the "Permissions" tab and find the inline policy that contains blocked KMS actions. Click on the policy to edit it.

5. **Edit the Inline Policy**: In the policy editor, locate the section where KMS actions are blocked. This may look like:
   ```
   {
       "Effect": "Deny",
       "Action": "kms:Encrypt",
       "Resource": "*"
   }
   ```
   Remove the block or update it to allow the necessary KMS actions as needed.

6. **Save Changes**: After making the necessary changes to the inline policy, click on the "Review policy" button to review the changes.

7. **Review and Apply Changes**: Review the policy changes to ensure that the necessary KMS actions are now allowed. If everything looks correct, click on the "Save changes" button to apply the updated policy.

8. **Verify Changes**: Once the policy is saved, verify that the blocked KMS actions have been remediated by attempting to perform the previously blocked actions. You can also use the IAM Policy Simulator to validate the changes.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the "Blocked KMS Actions In Inline Policies Should Be Set" misconfiguration in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the IAM user, group, or role that has inline policies with blocked KMS actions.
2. Use the AWS CLI to list all the inline policies attached to the IAM entity. You can use the following command:
   
   ```
   aws iam list-user-policies --user-name <IAM-USER-NAME>
   aws iam list-group-policies --group-name <IAM-GROUP-NAME>
   aws iam list-role-policies --role-name <IAM-ROLE-NAME>
   ```

3. For each inline policy identified in step 2, use the AWS CLI to get the policy document:
   
   ```
   aws iam get-user-policy --user-name <IAM-USER-NAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME>
   aws iam get-group-policy --group-name <IAM-GROUP-NAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME>
   aws iam get-role-policy --role-name <IAM-ROLE-NAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME>
   ```

4. Review the policy document to identify any blocked KMS actions. Look for statements that deny access to KMS actions.
5. Modify the policy document to allow the required KMS actions. Remove any explicit denies for KMS actions.
6. Update the inline policy with the modified policy document. Use the following command:

   ```
   aws iam put-user-policy --user-name <IAM-USER-NAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME> --policy-document file://<UPDATED-POLICY-DOCUMENT>
   aws iam put-group-policy --group-name <IAM-GROUP-NAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME> --policy-document file://<UPDATED-POLICY-DOCUMENT>
   aws iam put-role-policy --role-name <IAM-ROLE-NAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME> --policy-document file://<UPDATED-POLICY-DOCUMENT>
   ```

7. Verify that the inline policies no longer have blocked KMS actions by listing the policies and reviewing the policy documents.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using Python, follow these steps:

1. Identify the IAM user or role with the inline policy that contains blocked KMS actions.
2. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update the inline policy to allow the necessary KMS actions.
3. Modify the inline policy to include the required KMS actions.

Here is a sample Python script to remediate this issue:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the IAM client
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

# Specify the IAM user or role name
user_name = 'YOUR_USER_NAME'
policy_name = 'YOUR_POLICY_NAME'

# Specify the required KMS actions
kms_actions = [
    "kms:Encrypt",
    "kms:Decrypt",
    "kms:ReEncrypt*",
    "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
    "kms:DescribeKey"
]

# Get the current policy document
policy_document = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": kms_actions,
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

# Update the inline policy
response = iam_client.put_user_policy(
    UserName=user_name,
    PolicyName=policy_name,
    PolicyDocument=json.dumps(policy_document)
)

print("Policy updated successfully.")
```

Replace `'YOUR_USER_NAME'` and `'YOUR_POLICY_NAME'` with the actual IAM user or role name and policy name that need to be remediated. Update the `kms_actions` list with the required KMS actions that should be allowed in the inline policy.

Run this Python script to update the inline policy and allow the necessary KMS actions.
