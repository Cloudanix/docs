1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Policies". This will open a list of all the IAM policies that are currently configured in your AWS environment.

3. Select the policy you want to check for blocked KMS actions. This will open the policy details page.

4. In the policy details page, check the policy document for any "Deny" statements that are applied to KMS actions. If there are any "Deny" statements applied to KMS actions, then the policy is blocking those actions.

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute IAM related commands.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the IAM policies using the following command:
   ```
   aws iam list-policies --scope Local
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the IAM policies that are created within your AWS account.

3. For each policy, you can get the policy details including the policy document by using the following command:
   ```
   aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <Policy_ARN> --version-id <Policy_Version_ID>
   ```
   Replace `<Policy_ARN>` with the ARN of the policy and `<Policy_Version_ID>` with the version ID of the policy. This command will return the policy document which includes the permissions set by the policy.

4. Now, you need to check the policy document for any blocked KMS actions. You can do this by looking for "kms:Deny" statements in the policy document. If you find any such statements, it means that some KMS actions are blocked in the inline policy. You can use a JSON parser or a script to automate this process. For example, in Python, you can use the `json` module to parse the policy document and check for blocked KMS actions.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install and configure Boto3 to interact with AWS services. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials either by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```
   Or, you can create the credential file yourself at ~/.aws/credentials. At a minimum, it should look like this:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

2. Use Boto3 to list all IAM policies:
   You can use the `list_policies` method to retrieve all IAM policies. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # List policies
   response = iam.list_policies(Scope='All')
   for policy in response['Policies']:
       print(policy['PolicyName'])
   ```

3. Get the policy details:
   For each policy, you can use the `get_policy` method to retrieve the policy details, including the policy document. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # Get policy
   response = iam.get_policy(PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess')
   policy_document = response['Policy']['PolicyDocument']
   print(policy_document)
   ```

4. Check for blocked KMS actions:
   You can parse the policy document to check if it contains any blocked KMS actions. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3
   import json

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # Get policy
   response = iam.get_policy(PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess')
   policy_document = response['Policy']['PolicyDocument']

   # Parse policy document
   policy_document = json.loads(policy_document)

   # Check for blocked KMS actions
   for statement in policy_document['Statement']:
       if 'kms:Decrypt' in statement['Action'] and statement['Effect'] == 'Deny':
           print('Blocked KMS action found: kms:Decrypt')
   ```
   This script checks if the 'kms:Decrypt' action is blocked. You can modify it to check for other KMS actions.

### Remediation
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the "Blocked KMS Actions In Inline Policies Should Be Set" misconfiguration in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and login to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to IAM Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown in the top left corner and select "IAM" under the Security, Identity, & Compliance section.

3. **Select the User/Role/Group**: In the left-hand navigation pane, choose the appropriate option (User, Role, or Group) where the inline policy with blocked KMS actions exists.

4. **Locate the Inline Policy**: Scroll down to the "Permissions" tab and find the inline policy that contains blocked KMS actions. Click on the policy to edit it.

5. **Edit the Inline Policy**: In the policy editor, locate the section where KMS actions are blocked. This may look like:
   ```
   {
       "Effect": "Deny",
       "Action": "kms:Encrypt",
       "Resource": "*"
   }
   ```
   Remove the block or update it to allow the necessary KMS actions as needed.

6. **Save Changes**: After making the necessary changes to the inline policy, click on the "Review policy" button to review the changes.

7. **Review and Apply Changes**: Review the policy changes to ensure that the necessary KMS actions are now allowed. If everything looks correct, click on the "Save changes" button to apply the updated policy.

8. **Verify Changes**: Once the policy is saved, verify that the blocked KMS actions have been remediated by attempting to perform the previously blocked actions. You can also use the IAM Policy Simulator to validate the changes.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the "Blocked KMS Actions In Inline Policies Should Be Set" misconfiguration in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the IAM user, group, or role that has inline policies with blocked KMS actions.
2. Use the AWS CLI to list all the inline policies attached to the IAM entity. You can use the following command:
   
   ```
   aws iam list-user-policies --user-name <IAM-USER-NAME>
   aws iam list-group-policies --group-name <IAM-GROUP-NAME>
   aws iam list-role-policies --role-name <IAM-ROLE-NAME>
   ```

3. For each inline policy identified in step 2, use the AWS CLI to get the policy document:
   
   ```
   aws iam get-user-policy --user-name <IAM-USER-NAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME>
   aws iam get-group-policy --group-name <IAM-GROUP-NAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME>
   aws iam get-role-policy --role-name <IAM-ROLE-NAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME>
   ```

4. Review the policy document to identify any blocked KMS actions. Look for statements that deny access to KMS actions.
5. Modify the policy document to allow the required KMS actions. Remove any explicit denies for KMS actions.
6. Update the inline policy with the modified policy document. Use the following command:

   ```
   aws iam put-user-policy --user-name <IAM-USER-NAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME> --policy-document file://<UPDATED-POLICY-DOCUMENT>
   aws iam put-group-policy --group-name <IAM-GROUP-NAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME> --policy-document file://<UPDATED-POLICY-DOCUMENT>
   aws iam put-role-policy --role-name <IAM-ROLE-NAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME> --policy-document file://<UPDATED-POLICY-DOCUMENT>
   ```

7. Verify that the inline policies no longer have blocked KMS actions by listing the policies and reviewing the policy documents.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using Python, follow these steps:

1. Identify the IAM user or role with the inline policy that contains blocked KMS actions.
2. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update the inline policy to allow the necessary KMS actions.
3. Modify the inline policy to include the required KMS actions.

Here is a sample Python script to remediate this issue:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the IAM client
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

# Specify the IAM user or role name
user_name = 'YOUR_USER_NAME'
policy_name = 'YOUR_POLICY_NAME'

# Specify the required KMS actions
kms_actions = [
    "kms:Encrypt",
    "kms:Decrypt",
    "kms:ReEncrypt*",
    "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
    "kms:DescribeKey"
]

# Get the current policy document
policy_document = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": kms_actions,
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

# Update the inline policy
response = iam_client.put_user_policy(
    UserName=user_name,
    PolicyName=policy_name,
    PolicyDocument=json.dumps(policy_document)
)

print("Policy updated successfully.")
```

Replace `'YOUR_USER_NAME'` and `'YOUR_POLICY_NAME'` with the actual IAM user or role name and policy name that need to be remediated. Update the `kms_actions` list with the required KMS actions that should be allowed in the inline policy.

Run this Python script to update the inline policy and allow the necessary KMS actions.
