### More Info:

Root account has full permissions across the entire account. Root account should not have access keys. Also, it certainly shouldn't access any service. Instead, create IAM users with predefined roles.

### Risk Level

Critical

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

HIPAA, ISO27001, PCIDSS, GDPR, NIST, SOC2, CISAWS, CBP, HITRUST, AWSWAF, NISTCSF, FedRAMP

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**.
2. **Navigate to the IAM service**.
3. **Select Users from the navigation pane**.
4. **Identify the root user**:
   - Locate the user with the username "root".
5. **Review Access Keys**:
   - Click on the root user.
   - Go to the Security credentials tab.
   - Review the list of access keys.
6. **Deactivate or Delete Access Keys**:
   - Select the active access key(s) associated with the root user.
   - Choose Deactivate or Delete to make the access key(s) inactive or delete them.
7. **Repeat for other root users**:
   - If you have multiple root users, repeat the above steps for each of them.

#### Using CLI

1. **List Access Keys**:
```bash
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name root
```
2. **Identify Active Access Keys**:
   - Look for active access keys associated with the root user.
3. **Deactivate or Delete Access Keys**:
```bash
aws iam update-access-key --access-key-id ACCESS_KEY_ID --status Inactive --user-name root
```
Replace `ACCESS_KEY_ID` with the ID of the access key to deactivate.
4. **Repeat for other active access keys**:
   - If there are multiple active access keys associated with the root user, repeat the deactivation command for each of them.

#### Using Python

Here's a Python script to identify and deactivate active access keys associated with the root user:

```python
import boto3

class RootAccessKeyChecker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

    def get_active_access_keys(self):
        failures = []
        response = self.iam_client.list_access_keys(UserName='root')
        for key in response['AccessKeyMetadata']:
            if key['Status'] == 'Active':
                failures.append(key)
        return failures

    def deactivate_access_key(self, access_key_id):
        self.iam_client.update_access_key(
            UserName='root',
            AccessKeyId=access_key_id,
            Status='Inactive'
        )
        print(f"Access key {access_key_id} has been deactivated.")

# Instantiate the class
checker = RootAccessKeyChecker()

# Get active access keys for root user
active_access_keys = checker.get_active_access_keys()

# Deactivate active access keys
for key in active_access_keys:
    checker.deactivate_access_key(key['AccessKeyId'])
```

This Python script identifies active access keys associated with the root user and deactivates them.

Make sure to have appropriate IAM permissions for managing access keys if you're using AWS CLI or Python script.
