#### Using Console

To remediate the "Roles Should Not Have Inline Policies" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS Console, please follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the IAM console.
3. In the navigation pane, choose "Roles".
4. Select the role that has an inline policy attached to it.
5. Choose the "Permissions" tab.
6. Scroll down to the "Inline Policies" section.
7. Click on the inline policy that you want to remove.
8. Choose "Delete Policy".
9. Confirm that you want to delete the policy by clicking on "Delete".
10. Repeat steps 7-9 for all inline policies attached to the role.
11. After all inline policies have been removed, click on the "Policies" tab.
12. Click on "Create Policy".
13. Choose "Create Your Own Policy".
14. Enter a name for the policy and a description (optional).
15. In the "Policy Document" section, enter the policy JSON code that defines the permissions for the role.
16. Click on "Create Policy".
17. Go back to the "Roles" page and select the role that you just created the policy for.
18. Choose the "Permissions" tab.
19. Click on "Attach Policies".
20. Select the policy that you just created and click on "Attach Policy".
21. Verify that the role no longer has any inline policies attached to it and that it has a policy attached to it via the "Policies" tab.

Congratulations! You have successfully remediated the "Roles Should Not Have Inline Policies" misconfiguration in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue "Roles Should Not Have Inline Policies" in AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. List all the IAM roles in your AWS account using the following command:
```
aws iam list-roles
```

2. For each role, check if it has any inline policies attached to it using the following command:
```
aws iam list-role-policies --role-name <ROLE_NAME>
```

3. If the above command returns any inline policies, create a managed policy for the same using the following command:
```
aws iam create-policy --policy-name <POLICY_NAME> --policy-document file://<POLICY_DOCUMENT_FILE_PATH>
```
Note: Replace <POLICY_NAME> with a suitable name for the policy and <POLICY_DOCUMENT_FILE_PATH> with the path to the JSON policy document.

4. Attach the newly created managed policy to the role using the following command:
```
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name <ROLE_NAME> --policy-arn <POLICY_ARN>
```
Note: Replace <POLICY_ARN> with the ARN of the newly created managed policy and <ROLE_NAME> with the name of the role to which the policy needs to be attached.

5. Finally, remove the inline policy from the role using the following command:
```
aws iam delete-role-policy --role-name <ROLE_NAME> --policy-name <POLICY_NAME>
```
Note: Replace <POLICY_NAME> with the name of the inline policy and <ROLE_NAME> with the name of the role from which the policy needs to be removed.

Repeat the above steps for all the roles that have inline policies attached to them to remediate the issue "Roles Should Not Have Inline Policies" in AWS.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Roles Should Not Have Inline Policies" misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to identify the roles that have inline policies. You can achieve this by using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and the IAM client. You can use the `list_roles()` method to list all the roles in your AWS account, and then use the `get_role_policy()` method to get the policies attached to each role. If the policy is inline, you can add it to a list of inline policies.

```python
import boto3

iam = boto3.client('iam')

inline_policies = []

roles = iam.list_roles()['Roles']

for role in roles:
    policies = iam.list_role_policies(RoleName=role['RoleName'])['PolicyNames']
    for policy_name in policies:
        policy = iam.get_role_policy(RoleName=role['RoleName'], PolicyName=policy_name)
        if 'PolicyDocument' in policy and 'Version' in policy['PolicyDocument']:
            if policy['PolicyDocument']['Version'] == '2012-10-17':
                inline_policies.append(policy_name)
```

2. Once you have identified the roles with inline policies, you can remove them using the `delete_role_policy()` method. You can loop through the list of roles and policies and delete each inline policy.

```python
for role in roles:
    for policy_name in inline_policies:
        try:
            iam.delete_role_policy(RoleName=role['RoleName'], PolicyName=policy_name)
            print(f"Inline policy {policy_name} removed from role {role['RoleName']}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error removing inline policy {policy_name} from role {role['RoleName']}: {e}")
```

3. Finally, you can verify that the inline policies have been removed by repeating step 1 and checking that the list of inline policies is empty.

```python
inline_policies = []

for role in roles:
    policies = iam.list_role_policies(RoleName=role['RoleName'])['PolicyNames']
    for policy_name in policies:
        policy = iam.get_role_policy(RoleName=role['RoleName'], PolicyName=policy_name)
        if 'PolicyDocument' in policy and 'Version' in policy['PolicyDocument']:
            if policy['PolicyDocument']['Version'] == '2012-10-17':
                inline_policies.append(policy_name)

if not inline_policies:
    print("All inline policies have been removed from roles")
else:
    print(f"Inline policies still exist: {inline_policies}")
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Roles Should Not Have Inline Policies" misconfiguration in AWS using Python.
