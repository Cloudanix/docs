2. Create Managed Policies:
   - Identify Common Permissions:
     - Analyze the inline policies and identify the common permissions and access requirements across roles.
   - Create Managed Policies:
     - Create new managed policies based on the common permissions identified.

     - Give the policies descriptive names to easily identify their purpose.

     - For each role with an inline policy, detach the inline policy from the role.
