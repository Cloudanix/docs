<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". This will display a list of all IAM users associated with the account.

3. Click on the user name of the root account. This will open the summary page for the root account.

4. In the "Security Credentials" section, check the "Access Keys" list. If there are any access keys that are older than 90 days, it indicates that the root account certificates have not been rotated.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access IAM resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the following command to list all the IAM users in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws iam list-users
   ```

3. After getting the list of IAM users, you can use the following command to list the signing certificates of each user:

   ```
   aws iam list-signing-certificates --user-name <username>
   ```

   Replace `<username>` with the name of the IAM user. This command will return a list of the signing certificates associated with the specified IAM user.

4. To check the age of each certificate, look at the `UploadDate` field in the output of the previous command. If the certificate is older than a certain threshold (for example, 90 days), it should be considered for rotation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    aws_session_token='SESSION_TOKEN',
)
```

3. Now, you can use the IAM client to list all the server certificates:

```python
iam = session.client('iam')

certificates = iam.list_server_certificates()['ServerCertificateMetadataList']
```

4. Finally, you can iterate over the certificates and check the expiration date. If the certificate is close to its expiration date, it should be rotated:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

for certificate in certificates:
    expiration_date = certificate['Expiration']
    if expiration_date - datetime.now() < timedelta(days=30):  # 30 days before expiration
        print(f"Certificate {certificate['ServerCertificateName']} should be rotated")
```

This script will print the names of all certificates that should be rotated because they will expire in less than 30 days. You can adjust the number of days according to your needs.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**.
2. **Navigate to the IAM service**.
3. **Select Server Certificates from the navigation pane**.
4. **Identify the server certificates**:
   - Look for server certificates associated with the root user.
5. **Review Certificate Details**:
   - Click on the certificate.
   - Review the certificate details, including the upload date.
6. **Rotate Certificates**:
   - If a certificate has exceeded the minimum rotation threshold, rotate it using the appropriate method.
7. **Repeat for other certificates**:
   - Repeat the above steps for all certificates associated with the root user.

#
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. **List Server Certificates**:
```bash
aws iam list-server-certificates
```
2. **Identify Certificates for the Root User**:
   - Look for certificates associated with the root user based on the certificate path.
3. **Rotate Certificates**:
   - Rotate the certificates that have exceeded the minimum rotation threshold using the appropriate method.
4. **Repeat for other certificates**:
   - If there are multiple certificates associated with the root user, repeat the rotation process for each of them.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
Here's a Python script to identify and remediate server certificates that have exceeded the minimum rotation threshold for the root user:

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class CertificateRotationChecker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

    def get_certificates_for_root(self):
        root_certificates = []
        response = self.iam_client.list_server_certificates()
        for certificate in response['ServerCertificateMetadataList']:
            if certificate['Path'] == '/':
                root_certificates.append(certificate)
        return root_certificates

    def rotate_certificate(self, certificate_name):
        self.iam_client.update_server_certificate(
            ServerCertificateName=certificate_name,
            NewServerCertificateName=f"{certificate_name}-rotated"
        )
        print(f"Certificate {certificate_name} has been rotated.")

# Instantiate the class
checker = CertificateRotationChecker()

# Get certificates for root user
root_certificates = checker.get_certificates_for_root()

# Define minimum rotation days
minimum_rotation_days = 90  # Example value, adjust as necessary

# Rotate certificates that exceed the minimum rotation threshold
for certificate in root_certificates:
    upload_date = certificate['UploadDate']
    rotation_threshold = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=minimum_rotation_days)
    if upload_date < rotation_threshold:
        checker.rotate_certificate(certificate['ServerCertificateName'])
```

This Python script identifies server certificates associated with the root user and rotates them if they have exceeded the minimum rotation threshold.

Ensure to have appropriate IAM permissions for managing server certificates if you're using AWS CLI or Python script. Adjust the `minimum_rotation_days` variable according to your organization's policy.
