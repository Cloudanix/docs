### Remediation

How to remediate AWS Users having inline policies?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Review Existing Users:
   - Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.
   - Go to the "Users" section and review the list of existing users.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Users Should Not Have Inline Policies" Policy.)
   - Identify the users who have inline policies attached to their accounts.
2. Create Managed Policies:
   - Identify Common Permissions:
     - Analyze the inline policies and identify the common permissions and access requirements across users.
   - Create Managed Policies:
     - Create new managed policies based on the common permissions identified.
     - Define the desired set of permissions for each policy, ensuring the principle of least privilege.
     - Give the policies descriptive names to easily identify their purpose.
3. Attach Managed Policies to Users:
   - Detach Inline Policies:
     - For each user with an inline policy, detach the inline policy from their account.
   - Attach Managed Policies:
     - Attach the newly created managed policies to the appropriate users.
     - Assign policies based on the user's role, responsibilities, and required access levels.
4. Remove Unused Inline Policies:
   - Review Unused Inline Policies:
     - Identify any unused inline policies that are no longer needed.
   - Remove Unused Inline Policies:
     - Remove the unused inline policies from the user accounts.
