### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM dashboard.
2. In the IAM dashboard, click on "Policies" in the left navigation pane. This will display a list of all the IAM policies that are currently in use.
3. Use the Filter policies search box to find the IAM policies that you want to check. You can filter the policies by policy name, policy type, or by the services that the policy grants access to.
4. Once you have located the IAM policies that you want to check, click on the policy name to open the policy details page. Here, you can review the policy document to check if it contains any blacklisted actions or resources. If the policy document contains any blacklisted actions or resources, it means that the IAM policy is misconfigured.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Once you have AWS CLI installed and configured, you can proceed to the next steps.

2. To list all the IAM policies, use the following command:
   ```
   aws iam list-policies
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the IAM policies in your AWS account.

3. To check the details of a specific policy, use the following command:
   ```
   aws iam get-policy --policy-arn <PolicyARN>
   ```
   Replace `<PolicyARN>` with the ARN of the policy you want to check. This command will return the details of the specified policy.

4. To check if a policy is blacklisted, you need to compare the policy details with your list of blacklisted policies. This can be done manually or by using a script. If you are using a script, you can use the `json` module in Python to parse the policy details and compare them with your blacklist. Here is a simple example of how you can do this:
   ```python
   import json
   import subprocess

   # List of blacklisted policies
   blacklist = ['BlacklistedPolicy1', 'BlacklistedPolicy2']

   # Get the list of policies
   result = subprocess.run(['aws', 'iam', 'list-policies'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
   policies = json.loads(result.stdout)

   # Check each policy
   for policy in policies['Policies']:
       # Get the policy details
       result = subprocess.run(['aws', 'iam', 'get-policy', '--policy-arn', policy['Arn']], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
       policy_details = json.loads(result.stdout)

       # Check if the policy is blacklisted
       if policy_details['Policy']['PolicyName'] in blacklist:
           print(f"Blacklisted policy detected: {policy_details['Policy']['PolicyName']}")
   ```
   This script will print the name of each blacklisted policy it detects.

#### Using Python

1. **Import necessary libraries and establish a connection with AWS:**
   You will need to import the boto3 library, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You will also need to establish a connection with AWS using your access key and secret access key.

   ```python
   import boto3

   aws_access_key_id = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'
   aws_secret_access_key = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
   region_name = 'us-west-2' # or any other region

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id,
       aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key,
       region_name=region_name
   )
   iam = session.client('iam')
   ```

2. **Fetch all IAM policies:**
   Use the `list_policies` method to fetch all IAM policies. This method returns a dictionary containing all the policies.

   ```python
   policies = iam.list_policies(Scope='All')
   ```

3. **Check for blacklisted policies:**
   Iterate over the policies and check if any of them are in your blacklist. If a blacklisted policy is found, print it out or store it for further processing.

   ```python
   blacklist = ['blacklisted_policy1', 'blacklisted_policy2', ...] # replace with your blacklist

   for policy in policies['Policies']:
       if policy['PolicyName'] in blacklist:
           print(f"Blacklisted policy found: {policy['PolicyName']}")
   ```

4. **Handle pagination:**
   AWS IAM `list_policies` method returns a maximum of 100 policies at a time. If you have more than 100 policies, you need to handle pagination using the `Marker` parameter.

   ```python
   policies = iam.list_policies(Scope='All')
   while True:
       for policy in policies['Policies']:
           if policy['PolicyName'] in blacklist:
               print(f"Blacklisted policy found: {policy['PolicyName']}")
       if 'Marker' in policies:
           policies = iam.list_policies(Scope='All', Marker=policies['Marker'])
       else:
           break
   ```
   This script will print out all the blacklisted policies found in your AWS account.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of blacklisted IAM policies in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/) and log in using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to IAM Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top left corner of the console, then select "IAM" under the Security, Identity, & Compliance section.

3. **Check IAM Policies**: In the IAM dashboard, click on "Policies" in the left-hand menu to view the list of IAM policies in your account.

4. **Identify Blacklisted Policies**: Look through the list of policies to identify any blacklisted policies. These policies may contain overly permissive permissions or be known to be insecure.

5. **Review Policy Details**: Click on the blacklisted policy to review its details, including the permissions it grants and the resources it affects.

6. **Edit or Delete Policy**: Depending on the policy, you can either edit the policy to remove the blacklisted permissions or delete the policy entirely if it is not needed.

7. **Edit Policy**: To edit the policy, click on the "Edit policy" button and make the necessary changes to remove the blacklisted permissions. Ensure that the policy follows the principle of least privilege.

8. **Delete Policy**: If the policy is unnecessary or cannot be securely modified, you can delete the policy by selecting it and clicking on the "Delete policy" button.

9. **Monitor and Audit**: Regularly monitor your IAM policies to ensure that blacklisted policies do not reappear and conduct periodic audits to review and update permissions.

10. **Implement IAM Best Practices**: To prevent future blacklisted IAM policies, follow IAM best practices such as using IAM roles, implementing MFA, and regularly rotating access keys.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of blacklisted IAM policies in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console and ensure that your IAM policies adhere to security best practices.

#### Using CLI

To remediate blacklisted IAM policies in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the blacklisted IAM policies:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to list all IAM policies in your AWS account:
     ```
     aws iam list-policies
     ```
   - Review the list of policies and identify the blacklisted policies that need to be remediated.

2. Detach the blacklisted IAM policies from any IAM users, groups, or roles:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to list all IAM users, groups, and roles in your AWS account:
     ```
     aws iam list-users
     aws iam list-groups
     aws iam list-roles
     ```
   - For each IAM entity (user, group, or role) that has the blacklisted policy attached, run the following AWS CLI command to detach the policy:
     ```
     aws iam detach-user-policy --user-name <user-name> --policy-arn <policy-arn>
     aws iam detach-group-policy --group-name <group-name> --policy-arn <policy-arn>
     aws iam detach-role-policy --role-name <role-name> --policy-arn <policy-arn>
     ```
     Replace `<user-name>`, `<group-name>`, `<role-name>`, and `<policy-arn>` with the appropriate values.

3. Delete the blacklisted IAM policies:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to delete the blacklisted policies:
     ```
     aws iam delete-policy --policy-arn <policy-arn>
     ```
     Replace `<policy-arn>` with the ARN of the blacklisted policy.

4. Monitor and verify:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to ensure that the blacklisted policies have been successfully detached and deleted:
     ```
     aws iam list-entities-for-policy --policy-arn <policy-arn>
     ```
   - Verify that the blacklisted policies no longer appear in the list of attached policies.

By following these steps, you can effectively remediate blacklisted IAM policies in AWS IAM using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate blacklisted IAM policies in AWS IAM using Python, follow these steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Create a Python script to list all IAM policies and check if any blacklisted policies are attached to any IAM users, groups, or roles. Here is an example script to get you started:

```python
import boto3

# Define the blacklisted IAM policies
blacklisted_policies = ['arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess', 'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/PowerUserAccess']

# Create an AWS IAM client
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

# List all IAM policies
response = iam_client.list_policies()

# Check if any blacklisted policies are attached to any IAM users, groups, or roles
for policy in response['Policies']:
    policy_arn = policy['Arn']
    if policy_arn in blacklisted_policies:
        response = iam_client.list_entities_for_policy(PolicyArn=policy_arn)
        for entity_type, entities in response['PolicyGroups'], response['PolicyUsers'], response['PolicyRoles']:
            for entity in entities:
                print(f"Detected blacklisted policy {policy_arn} attached to {entity_type}: {entity['Arn']}")

```

3. Run the Python script to identify any IAM entities that have blacklisted policies attached. If any are found, you can remove the blacklisted policies from the entities using the `detach_policy` method in the Boto3 IAM client.

4. To detach a policy from an IAM user, group, or role, you can use the `detach_policy` method. Here is an example code snippet to detach a policy from an IAM user:

```python
iam_client.detach_user_policy(UserName='example_user', PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess')
```

5. Repeat the detachment process for all IAM entities that have blacklisted policies attached until all blacklisted policies are removed.

By following these steps, you can remediate blacklisted IAM policies in AWS IAM using Python.
