2. Open the IAM console by navigating to the IAM service.
3. In the navigation pane, click on "Users" to view the list of IAM users in your account.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "User Account Access keys Should Be Rotated" Policy.)
4. Locate the IAM user with the outdated access key that you want to change.
5. Select the checkbox next to the IAM user's name to activate the actions menu.
6. Click on the "Security credentials" tab in the user details view.
7. In the "Access keys" section, you will see the list of access keys associated with the user.
8. Identify the outdated access key that needs to be changed and click on the "Make inactive" link next to it. This will deactivate the access key.
9. Click on the "Create access key" button to generate a new access key for the user.
10. AWS will generate a new access key and display the access key ID and secret access key. Make sure to copy and securely store the secret access key as it will not be shown again.
11. After copying the access key ID and secret access key, click on the "Close" button to finish the process.
12. Update the access key in any applications or services that use the outdated key with the new access key details.
