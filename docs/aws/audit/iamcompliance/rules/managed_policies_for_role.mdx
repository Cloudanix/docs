### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent IAM Custom Role Policies from being present in IAM using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Review Existing IAM Roles:**
   - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click on "Roles" in the left-hand menu.
   - Review the list of existing roles and identify any custom roles that have policies attached.

2. **Restrict Creation of Custom Roles:**
   - Go to the "Policies" section in the IAM Dashboard.
   - Create or update a policy that restricts the creation of custom roles.
   - Attach this policy to IAM users or groups that should not have the ability to create custom roles.

3. **Enable AWS Config Rules:**
   - Navigate to the AWS Config service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Set up AWS Config rules to monitor IAM role configurations.
   - Enable rules such as "iam-role-managed-policy-check" to ensure that only managed policies are attached to roles.

4. **Set Up CloudWatch Alarms:**
   - Go to the CloudWatch service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Create a new alarm that triggers on specific IAM events, such as the creation of a custom role.
   - Configure the alarm to send notifications to administrators for immediate review and action.

By following these steps, you can effectively monitor and control the presence of IAM Custom Role Policies in your AWS environment.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent IAM Custom Role Policies from being present in IAM using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **List Existing IAM Roles:**
   First, identify all the IAM roles in your AWS account to ensure you know which roles are currently configured.
   ```sh
   aws iam list-roles
   ```

2. **Check for Custom Policies Attached to Roles:**
   For each role, check if there are any custom policies attached. This will help you identify roles that might have custom policies.
   ```sh
   aws iam list-role-policies --role-name <role-name>
   ```

3. **Detach Custom Policies from Roles:**
   If you find any custom policies attached to a role, detach them to ensure that no custom policies are present.
   ```sh
   aws iam delete-role-policy --role-name <role-name> --policy-name <policy-name>
   ```

4. **Enforce Use of Managed Policies:**
   Ensure that roles only use AWS managed policies or predefined policies by attaching them to the roles.
   ```sh
   aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name <role-name> --policy-arn <arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/<policy-name>>
   ```

By following these steps, you can prevent the presence of custom role policies in IAM using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent IAM Custom Role Policies from being present in IAM using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Environment and Install Required Libraries:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary SDKs installed for AWS, Azure, and GCP.
   - For AWS, use `boto3`.
   - For Azure, use `azure-identity` and `azure-mgmt-authorization`.
   - For GCP, use `google-cloud-iam`.

2. **Authenticate and Initialize Clients:**
   - Authenticate and initialize the respective clients for AWS, Azure, and GCP.

3. **Check for Existing Custom Roles:**
   - Write scripts to list and check for existing custom roles in each cloud environment.

4. **Prevent Creation of Custom Roles:**
   - Implement logic to prevent the creation of custom roles by monitoring and intercepting role creation requests.

Here are the Python scripts for each cloud provider:

### AWS (Using `boto3`)

```python
import boto3

# Initialize IAM client
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

# List all custom roles
def list_custom_roles():
    roles = iam_client.list_roles()
    custom_roles = [role for role in roles['Roles'] if 'AWS' not in role['Arn']]
    return custom_roles

# Prevent creation of custom roles
def prevent_custom_roles():
    custom_roles = list_custom_roles()
    if custom_roles:
        print("Custom roles detected. Preventing creation of new custom roles.")
        # Implement logic to prevent creation of new custom roles
        # This could involve setting up IAM policies or alerts

prevent_custom_roles()
```

### Azure (Using `azure-identity` and `azure-mgmt-authorization`)

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.authorization import AuthorizationManagementClient

# Initialize Azure client
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your_subscription_id'
auth_client = AuthorizationManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# List all custom roles
def list_custom_roles():
    custom_roles = []
    for role in auth_client.role_definitions.list(scope='/subscriptions/' + subscription_id):
        if role.role_type == 'CustomRole':
            custom_roles.append(role)
    return custom_roles

# Prevent creation of custom roles
def prevent_custom_roles():
    custom_roles = list_custom_roles()
    if custom_roles:
        print("Custom roles detected. Preventing creation of new custom roles.")
        # Implement logic to prevent creation of new custom roles
        # This could involve setting up policies or alerts

prevent_custom_roles()
```

### GCP (Using `google-cloud-iam`)

```python
from google.cloud import iam_v1
from google.oauth2 import service_account

# Initialize GCP IAM client
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path_to_your_service_account_key.json')
iam_client = iam_v1.IAMClient(credentials=credentials)

# List all custom roles
def list_custom_roles():
    custom_roles = []
    project_id = 'your_project_id'
    roles = iam_client.list_roles(parent=f'projects/{project_id}')
    for role in roles:
        if role.stage == iam_v1.Role.Stage.CUSTOM:
            custom_roles.append(role)
    return custom_roles

# Prevent creation of custom roles
def prevent_custom_roles():
    custom_roles = list_custom_roles()
    if custom_roles:
        print("Custom roles detected. Preventing creation of new custom roles.")
        # Implement logic to prevent creation of new custom roles
        # This could involve setting up policies or alerts

prevent_custom_roles()
```

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Roles". This will display a list of all the IAM roles that are currently configured within your AWS environment.

3. Click on each role to view its details. Under the "Permissions" tab, you can see the policies attached to the role. If there are any custom policies, they will be listed here.

4. To verify if the policy is custom or managed by AWS, click on the policy name. If it's a custom policy, it will open in a new tab showing the policy document. AWS managed policies will not open in a new tab, instead, it will show the permissions summary.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access IAM roles and policies.

2. Once AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the IAM roles in your AWS account using the following command:
   ```
   aws iam list-roles
   ```
   This command will return a JSON object containing all the IAM roles in your AWS account.

3. To check if there are any custom role policies, you can use the following command for each role:
   ```
   aws iam list-role-policies --role-name {role-name}
   ```
   Replace `{role-name}` with the name of the IAM role you want to check. This command will return a list of all inline policies attached to the specified IAM role.

4. If the output of the above command is not empty, it means there are custom role policies present in IAM. You can further investigate these policies by using the following command:
   ```
   aws iam get-role-policy --role-name {role-name} --policy-name {policy-name}
   ```
   Replace `{role-name}` with the name of the IAM role and `{policy-name}` with the name of the policy you want to check. This command will return the policy document for the specified inline policy.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your local environment. You can do this using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using the AWS CLI. You can do this by running `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. Import necessary libraries and create an IAM client:
   In your Python script, you need to import the Boto3 library and create an IAM client. This client will allow you to interact with the AWS IAM service.
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')
   ```

3. List all IAM roles and check for custom role policies:
   You can use the `list_roles` method of the IAM client to get a list of all IAM roles in your AWS account. Then, for each role, you can use the `list_role_policies` method to get a list of all inline policies attached to that role. If any inline policies are found, it means that custom role policies are present.
   ```python
   # List all IAM roles
   roles = iam.list_roles()
   for role in roles['Roles']:
       # List all inline policies for the current role
       inline_policies = iam.list_role_policies(RoleName=role['RoleName'])
       if inline_policies['PolicyNames']:
           print(f"Custom role policies found for role: {role['RoleName']}")
   ```

4. Analyze the output:
   Run the Python script and analyze the output. If any custom role policies are found, the script will print the name of the role. If no custom role policies are found, the script will not print anything. This way, you can easily detect if any IAM custom role policies are present in your AWS account.
