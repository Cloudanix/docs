title: Blocked KMS Actions In Inline Policies Should Be Set
sidebar_label: Blocked KMS Actions In Inline Policies Should Be Set
---

### More Info:

This rule checks if the inline policies attached to your IAM groups do not allow blocked actions on all AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys. The rule is NON_COMPLIANT if any blocked action is allowed on all AWS KMS keys in an inline policy.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies for AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Inline Policy**: First, you need to identify the IAM user, group, or role that has the inline policy with blocked KMS actions.

2. **Access the IAM Console**: Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.

3. **Locate the User, Group, or Role**: In the IAM console, locate and select the IAM user, group, or role that has the inline policy with blocked KMS actions.

4. **Edit Inline Policy**: Within the user, group, or role details page, locate the inline policy that contains the blocked KMS actions.

5. **Update the Policy**: Edit the inline policy to allow the necessary KMS actions that were previously blocked. You can do this by adding the required permissions to the policy document.

6. **Review and Save Changes**: After updating the policy document to allow the required KMS actions, review the changes to ensure they are correct. Once you are satisfied, save the changes to update the inline policy.

7. **Verify Permissions**: Test the permissions by attempting to perform the KMS actions that were previously blocked. Ensure that the user, group, or role can now successfully perform these actions.

8. **Monitor for Compliance**: Regularly monitor the IAM policies to ensure that blocked KMS actions are not reintroduced and that all necessary permissions are correctly configured.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies for AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies for AWS IAM using AWS CLI, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Identify the inline policy attached to the IAM user, group, or role that contains blocked KMS actions. You can use the following AWS CLI command to list all the inline policies attached to the IAM entity:

```bash
aws iam list-user-policies --user-name <IAM-USERNAME>
aws iam list-group-policies --group-name <IAM-GROUPNAME>
aws iam list-role-policies --role-name <IAM-ROLENAME>
```

Replace `<IAM-USERNAME>`, `<IAM-GROUPNAME>`, or `<IAM-ROLENAME>` with the appropriate IAM entity name.

2. Once you have identified the inline policy that contains blocked KMS actions, you need to edit the policy document to allow the necessary KMS actions. You can use the following AWS CLI command to get the policy document for the inline policy:

```bash
aws iam get-user-policy --user-name <IAM-USERNAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME>
aws iam get-group-policy --group-name <IAM-GROUPNAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME>
aws iam get-role-policy --role-name <IAM-ROLENAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME>
```

Replace `<IAM-USERNAME>`, `<IAM-GROUPNAME>`, `<IAM-ROLENAME>`, and `<POLICY-NAME>` with the appropriate values.

3. Edit the policy document to allow the necessary KMS actions. You can use a text editor to modify the policy document and add the required KMS actions.

4. Once you have updated the policy document, you can use the following AWS CLI command to update the inline policy with the new policy document:

```bash
aws iam put-user-policy --user-name <IAM-USERNAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME> --policy-document file://<PATH-TO-UPDATED-POLICY-DOCUMENT>
aws iam put-group-policy --group-name <IAM-GROUPNAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME> --policy-document file://<PATH-TO-UPDATED-POLICY-DOCUMENT>
aws iam put-role-policy --role-name <IAM-ROLENAME> --policy-name <POLICY-NAME> --policy-document file://<PATH-TO-UPDATED-POLICY-DOCUMENT>
```

Replace `<IAM-USERNAME>`, `<IAM-GROUPNAME>`, `<IAM-ROLENAME>`, `<POLICY-NAME>`, and `<PATH-TO-UPDATED-POLICY-DOCUMENT>` with the appropriate values.

5. Verify that the inline policy has been updated successfully by listing the inline policies again and checking the policy document.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies for AWS IAM using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the IAM user, group, or role that has the inline policy with blocked KMS actions.
2. Update the inline policy to allow the necessary KMS actions.
3. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to programmatically update the inline policy.

Here is an example Python script to remediate this misconfiguration:

```python
import boto3

# Define the IAM entity (user, group, role) and the inline policy with blocked KMS actions
entity_name = 'your-entity-name'
policy_name = 'your-inline-policy-name'
blocked_actions = ['kms:Encrypt', 'kms:Decrypt']  # Add any other blocked KMS actions

# Initialize the IAM client
iam = boto3.client('iam')

# Get the inline policy document
policy_document = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

# Update the inline policy to allow all KMS actions
response = iam.put_user_policy(
    UserName=entity_name,
    PolicyName=policy_name,
    PolicyDocument=json.dumps(policy_document)
)

# Check if the policy update was successful
if response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode'] == 200:
    print(f"Successfully updated inline policy for {entity_name} to allow all KMS actions.")
else:
    print("Failed to update inline policy.")
```

Make sure to replace `'your-entity-name'` and `'your-inline-policy-name'` with the actual IAM entity name and inline policy name that need to be remediated. Also, update the `blocked_actions` list with the specific KMS actions that were previously blocked.

By running this script, you can programmatically update the inline policy to allow all KMS actions and remediate the misconfiguration of blocked KMS actions in AWS IAM.
