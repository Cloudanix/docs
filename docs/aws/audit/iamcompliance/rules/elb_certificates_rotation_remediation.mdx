### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the ELB Certificates Should Be Rotated misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. Click on the "Load Balancers" option in the left-hand menu.
3. Select the load balancer that has the outdated certificate.
4. Click on the "Listeners" tab.
5. Click the pencil icon next to the listener that has the outdated certificate.
6. In the "Edit Listener" dialog box, click on the "Change" button next to the SSL certificate.
7. Select the new certificate from the list of available certificates or upload a new one.
8. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.
9. Repeat steps 5-8 for all listeners that have outdated certificates.
10. After updating the certificates, verify that the load balancer is functioning properly by testing it.

Note: It is recommended that you rotate your SSL/TLS certificates at least once a year to ensure that they are up-to-date and secure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the ELB certificate rotation misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the ELB that needs certificate rotation by running the following command:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancers
```

This will list all the ELBs in your AWS account.

2. Once you have identified the ELB that needs certificate rotation, run the following command to retrieve the current certificate details:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-name <ELB-Name> --query 'LoadBalancerAttributes.SSLServerCertificate' 
```

Replace `<ELB-Name>` with the name of the ELB that needs certificate rotation.

3. Verify the certificate expiry date and ensure that it is within the recommended time frame for rotation. If it is expired or about to expire, you need to request a new certificate from your certificate authority.

4. Once you have obtained the new certificate, upload it to AWS IAM by running the following command:

```
aws iam upload-server-certificate --server-certificate-name <Certificate-Name> --certificate-body file://<Certificate-File-Path> --private-key file://<Private-Key-File-Path>
```

Replace `<Certificate-Name>` with a name for the new certificate, `<Certificate-File-Path>` with the path to the new certificate file, and `<Private-Key-File-Path>` with the path to the private key file for the new certificate.

5. After uploading the new certificate, update the ELB with the new certificate by running the following command:

```
aws elb set-load-balancer-listener-ssl-certificate --load-balancer-name <ELB-Name> --load-balancer-port <Port> --ssl-certificate-id <Certificate-ID>
```

Replace `<ELB-Name>` with the name of the ELB that needs certificate rotation, `<Port>` with the port number for which the certificate is being updated, and `<Certificate-ID>` with the ID of the new certificate that was uploaded to AWS IAM.

6. Verify that the new certificate is being used by running the following command:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-name <ELB-Name> --query 'LoadBalancerAttributes.SSLServerCertificate'
```

This will display the details of the new certificate being used by the ELB.

7. Finally, ensure that the certificate rotation process is automated to avoid future misconfigurations. You can use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to automate the process of certificate issuance, deployment, and renewal.

#### Using Python

To remediate the ELB certificate rotation misconfiguration in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDKs and libraries, such as boto3 and datetime.

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime
```

2. Initialize the AWS client with the appropriate credentials and region.

```python
elb_client = boto3.client('elbv2', region_name='us-east-1')
```

3. Get a list of all the load balancers in your AWS account.

```python
elbs = elb_client.describe_load_balancers()['LoadBalancers']
```

4. For each load balancer, check the expiration date of its SSL certificate.

```python
for elb in elbs:
    certs = elb_client.describe_certificates(LoadBalancerArn=elb['LoadBalancerArn'])['Certificates']
    for cert in certs:
        if cert['Type'] == 'acm':
            cert_expiration = cert['NotAfter']
            if cert_expiration < datetime.now(cert_expiration.tzinfo):
                # certificate has expired, rotate it
            else:
                # certificate is still valid, no action needed
```

5. If the certificate has expired, use the AWS SDK to request a new certificate.

```python
acm_client = boto3.client('acm', region_name='us-east-1')
new_cert = acm_client.request_certificate(
    DomainName='example.com',
    ValidationMethod='DNS',
    SubjectAlternativeNames=[
        '*.example.com',
    ]
)
```

6. After the new certificate is issued, update the load balancer with the new certificate.

```python
elb_client.modify_listener(
    ListenerArn='listener-arn',
    Certificates=[
        {
            'CertificateArn': new_cert['CertificateArn']
        }
    ]
)
```

7. Repeat this process for all load balancers in your AWS account.

Note: This is just a basic outline of the steps involved in remediating the ELB certificate rotation misconfiguration in AWS using Python. The specific implementation may vary depending on your specific configuration and requirements.
