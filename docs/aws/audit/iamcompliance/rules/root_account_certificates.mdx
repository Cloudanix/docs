How to disable any active X?509 signing certificates created for AWS root account?

#### Using AWS Console

As of September 2021, AWS no longer supports X.509 certificates for root accounts. Root accounts now use password-based authentication or multi-factor authentication (MFA) for login. Therefore, there is no need to rotate X.509 certificates for the AWS root account.

Instead, it is recommended to secure your AWS root account by following these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your root account credentials.
2. Navigate to the IAM service by searching for "IAM" in the AWS services search bar and selecting "IAM" from the results.
3. In the IAM dashboard, click on "Users" in the left sidebar.
4. Locate the root account user and click on its username.
5. In the user details page, navigate to the "Security credentials" tab.
6. Ensure that strong, unique passwords are used for the root account. If you haven't already done so, you can update the password by clicking on the "Manage" button in the "Login profile" section.
7. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the root account. This adds an extra layer of security to protect your account.
   - In the "Security credentials" tab, navigate to the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section.
   - Click on the "Manage MFA" button and follow the on-screen instructions to set up MFA for the root account.
   - Use a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA device for enhanced security.
