### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent certificates from being tied to the root account in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Create an IAM User for Certificate Management:**
   - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click on "Users" in the left-hand menu.
   - Click the "Add user" button.
   - Enter a username and select "Programmatic access" for access type.
   - Click "Next: Permissions" and attach the necessary policies for certificate management (e.g., `AWSCertificateManagerFullAccess`).

2. **Generate and Use Certificates with IAM User:**
   - Ensure that any new certificates are generated and managed using the IAM user created specifically for this purpose.
   - Navigate to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the AWS Management Console.
   - Use the IAM user credentials to request and manage certificates.

3. **Review and Remove Root Account Certificates:**
   - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
   - Click on "Users" and select the root account.
   - Check for any certificates associated with the root account and remove them if found.

4. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Root Account:**
   - Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
   - Click on "Dashboard" in the left-hand menu.
   - Under "Security Status," find "Activate MFA on your root account" and follow the steps to enable MFA.
   - This adds an additional layer of security, ensuring that the root account is not used for day-to-day operations, including certificate management.

By following these steps, you can ensure that certificates are not tied to the root account, enhancing the security of your AWS environment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent certificates from being tied to the root account in AWS IAM using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create an IAM User for Certificate Management:**
   - Create a new IAM user specifically for managing certificates.
   ```sh
   aws iam create-user --user-name CertificateManager
   ```

2. **Attach a Policy to the IAM User:**
   - Attach a policy to the IAM user that grants the necessary permissions for managing certificates.
   ```sh
   aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name CertificateManager --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCertificateManagerFullAccess
   ```

3. **Generate Access Keys for the IAM User:**
   - Generate access keys for the IAM user to use for certificate management.
   ```sh
   aws iam create-access-key --user-name CertificateManager
   ```

4. **Use the IAM User for Certificate Operations:**
   - Configure your AWS CLI to use the IAM user's credentials for certificate operations.
   ```sh
   aws configure
   # Enter the access key and secret key for the CertificateManager user
   ```

By following these steps, you ensure that certificates are managed by a dedicated IAM user rather than the root account, enhancing security and reducing the risk of misconfigurations.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent certificates from being tied to the root account in IAM using Python scripts, you can use the respective SDKs for AWS, Azure, and GCP. Below are the steps and example scripts for each cloud provider:

### AWS (Using Boto3)

1. **Install Boto3**:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create a Python script to check and prevent certificates tied to the root account**:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_root_certificates():
       iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
       response = iam_client.list_server_certificates()
       root_account_id = boto3.client('sts').get_caller_identity().get('Account')

       for cert in response['ServerCertificateMetadataList']:
           if cert['Arn'].split(':')[4] == root_account_id:
               print(f"Certificate {cert['ServerCertificateName']} is tied to the root account. Please reassign it to a specific IAM user or role.")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_root_certificates()
   ```

### Azure (Using Azure SDK for Python)

1. **Install Azure SDK**:
   ```bash
   pip install azure-identity azure-mgmt-keyvault
   ```

2. **Create a Python script to check and prevent certificates tied to the root account**:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.mgmt.keyvault import KeyVaultManagementClient

   def check_root_certificates(subscription_id):
       credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
       kv_client = KeyVaultManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
       vaults = kv_client.vaults.list()

       for vault in vaults:
           certificates = kv_client.certificates.list(vault.name, vault.resource_group_name)
           for cert in certificates:
               if cert.properties.issuer_name == 'Self':
                   print(f"Certificate {cert.name} in vault {vault.name} is tied to the root account. Please reassign it to a specific user or service principal.")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
       check_root_certificates(subscription_id)
   ```

### GCP (Using Google Cloud Client Libraries)

1. **Install Google Cloud Client Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install google-cloud-iam
   ```

2. **Create a Python script to check and prevent certificates tied to the root account**:
   ```python
   from google.cloud import iam_credentials_v1
   from google.oauth2 import service_account

   def check_root_certificates():
       credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path-to-your-service-account-file.json')
       client = iam_credentials_v1.IAMCredentialsClient(credentials=credentials)
       project_id = 'your-project-id'
       service_accounts = client.list_service_accounts(name=f'projects/{project_id}')

       for sa in service_accounts.accounts:
           if sa.email.endswith('iam.gserviceaccount.com'):
               print(f"Service account {sa.email} has certificates tied to it. Please reassign them to a specific user or service account.")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_root_certificates()
   ```

### Summary

1. **Install the necessary SDKs for your cloud provider**.
2. **Create a Python script to list certificates and check if they are tied to the root account**.
3. **Print a warning message if any certificates are found to be tied to the root account**.
4. **Run the script to ensure no certificates are tied to the root account**.

These scripts will help you identify and prevent certificates from being tied to the root account in AWS, Azure, and GCP.

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM dashboard.
2. In the IAM dashboard, click on "Users" in the left navigation pane. This will display a list of all IAM users associated with your AWS account.
3. Click on the name of the root account. This will open the summary page for the root account.
4. In the summary page, check the "Security credentials" tab. If there are any certificates listed under "Signing certificates", it means that certificates are tied with the root account.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS here: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/. After installation, you need to configure the AWS CLI with your credentials. You can do this by running `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all IAM users: To check if any certificates are tied with the root account, you first need to list all IAM users. You can do this by running the following command: `aws iam list-users --query 'Users[*].UserName' --output text`. This will return a list of all IAM user names.

3. Check for certificates associated with each user: For each user returned in the previous step, you need to check if there are any certificates associated with them. You can do this by running the following command for each user: `aws iam list-signing-certificates --user-name <username>`. Replace `<username>` with the name of the user. This will return a list of all certificates associated with the user.

4. Check for certificates associated with the root account: Finally, you need to check if there are any certificates associated with the root account. You can do this by running the following command: `aws iam list-signing-certificates --user-name root`. If this returns any certificates, then there are certificates tied with the root account.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS services. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating the files ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config. In the credentials file, add:

   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

   In the config file, add:

   ```
   [default]
   region=us-east-1
   ```

3. Write a Python script to list all IAM users and their associated certificates:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # List all IAM users
   users = iam.list_users()['Users']

   for user in users:
       # List all certificates for each user
       certs = iam.list_signing_certificates(UserName=user['UserName'])['Certificates']
       for cert in certs:
           print(f"User: {user['UserName']}, Certificate ID: {cert['CertificateId']}")
   ```

4. Analyze the output: If the root account is listed in the output, it means that there are certificates tied to the root account. This is a misconfiguration because the root account has full access to all resources in the AWS account, and it's recommended to use IAM users for everyday tasks to reduce the risk of accidental changes.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
When a certificate is tied with the root account in AWS, it can pose a security risk as it allows anyone with access to the root account to manage the certificate and its associated resources. To remediate this issue, you can follow the steps below:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using the root account credentials.
2. Navigate to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service.
3. Select the certificate that is tied with the root account.
4. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Export Certificate."
5. Save the certificate file to a secure location.
6. Click on the "Actions" button again and select "Delete."
7. Confirm the deletion by entering "delete" in the confirmation box.
8. Create a new IAM user with the necessary permissions to manage the certificate and its associated resources.
9. Log out of the root account and log in to the AWS Management Console using the newly created IAM user credentials.
10. Navigate to the ACM service and import the certificate file saved in step 5.
11. Associate the certificate with the necessary resources, such as a load balancer or CloudFront distribution, as required.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the certificate is no longer tied with the root account and is managed securely by an IAM user with the necessary permissions.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Certificates Should Not Be Tied With Root Account" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.
2. Run the following command to list all the certificates associated with the root account:

   ```
   aws acm list-certificates --certificate-statuses ISSUED --query "CertificateSummaryList[?DomainName=='*']"
   ```

   This command will list all the certificates that are associated with the root account.

3. Identify the certificate that needs to be remediated.

4. Run the following command to detach the certificate from the root account:

   ```
   aws acm update-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn> --no-include-in-certificate-chain
   ```

   Replace `<certificate-arn>` with the ARN of the certificate that needs to be detached.

5. Verify that the certificate is no longer associated with the root account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws acm list-certificates --certificate-statuses ISSUED --query "CertificateSummaryList[?DomainName=='*']"
   ```

   This command should not list the certificate that was detached from the root account.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for any other certificates that need to be remediated.

7. Once all the certificates have been detached from the root account, create an IAM user with the necessary permissions to manage the certificates.

   ```
   aws iam create-user --user-name <username>
   ```

   Replace `<username>` with the desired username for the IAM user.

8. Attach the necessary permissions to the IAM user by creating an IAM policy and attaching it to the user.

   ```
   aws iam create-policy --policy-name <policy-name> --policy-document file://<policy-document>
   ```

   Replace `<policy-name>` with the desired name for the policy and `<policy-document>` with the path to the policy document in JSON format.

9. Attach the policy to the IAM user.

   ```
   aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <username> --policy-arn <policy-arn>
   ```

   Replace `<username>` with the username of the IAM user and `<policy-arn>` with the ARN of the policy that was created in step 8.

10. Verify that the IAM user can manage the certificates by running the following command:

    ```
    aws acm list-certificates --certificate-statuses ISSUED --query "CertificateSummaryList[?DomainName=='*']" --profile <profile-name>
    ```

    Replace `<profile-name>` with the name of the AWS CLI profile that is associated with the IAM user.

11. Delete the root access keys and secret access keys for the root account to ensure that the certificates cannot be managed using the root account.

    ```
    aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id <access-key-id> --user-name <root-account-username>
    ```

    Replace `<access-key-id>` with the access key ID for the root account and `<root-account-username>` with the username for the root account.

    Repeat this command for all access keys associated with the root account.

12. Once all the access keys have been deleted, disable the root account.

    ```
    aws iam update-login-profile --user-name <root-account-username> --password-reset-required --no-password
    ```

    Replace `<root-account-username>` with the username for the root account.

    This command will disable the root account and require a password reset to enable it again.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Certificates Should Not Be Tied With Root Account" for AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Certificates Should Not Be Tied With Root Account" in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Create a new IAM user with the necessary permissions to manage certificates in AWS.
2. Associate the IAM user with the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
3. Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to migrate the existing SSL/TLS certificates from the root account to the newly created IAM user.
4. Verify that the certificates are successfully migrated and associated with the IAM user.

Here's the Python code to migrate the SSL/TLS certificates from the root account to the newly created IAM user:

```python
import boto3

# Create a new IAM user with the necessary permissions
iam = boto3.client('iam')
response = iam.create_user(UserName='new_user')
response = iam.attach_user_policy(
    UserName='new_user',
    PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCertificateManagerReadOnly'
)

# Associate the IAM user with the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
acm = boto3.client('acm')
response = acm.list_certificates()
for certificate in response['CertificateSummaryList']:
    certificate_arn = certificate['CertificateArn']
    response = acm.list_tags_for_certificate(CertificateArn=certificate_arn)
    tags = response['Tags']
    if 'aws:account' in tags and tags['aws:account'] == 'root':
        response = acm.remove_tags_from_certificate(
            CertificateArn=certificate_arn,
            Tags=[
                {
                    'Key': 'aws:account',
                    'Value': 'root'
                }
            ]
        )
        response = acm.add_tags_to_certificate(
            CertificateArn=certificate_arn,
            Tags=[
                {
                    'Key': 'aws:account',
                    'Value': 'new_user'
                }
            ]
        )
```

This code creates a new IAM user and attaches the `AWSCertificateManagerReadOnly` policy to it. It then uses the `list_certificates` API to retrieve a list of all SSL/TLS certificates in the account and checks if each certificate is associated with the root account. If a certificate is associated with the root account, it removes the `aws:account` tag from it and adds a new `aws:account` tag with the value `new_user`, thus associating the certificate with the newly created IAM user.

After running this code, you should verify that the SSL/TLS certificates are successfully migrated to the newly created IAM user and are no longer associated with the root account.
