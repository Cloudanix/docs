1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Credential Report". This report will list all your account's users and the status of their various credentials.

3. If the report is not ready, choose "Download Report". This will generate a new report.

4. Open the report and look for the root account. Check the "password_last_used" or "access_key_1_last_used_date" columns. If these columns show a recent date, it means the root account has been used recently.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all IAM users: To check the activity of the root account, you first need to list all IAM users. You can do this by running the command `aws iam list-users`. This will return a list of all IAM users in your AWS account.

3. Check last used access key: To check when the root account was last used, you can use the command `aws iam get-access-key-last-used --access-key-id <access-key-id>`. Replace `<access-key-id>` with the access key ID of the root account. This will return the date and time when the root account was last used.

4. Check CloudTrail logs: AWS CloudTrail logs all API calls made in your AWS account. You can use these logs to monitor the activity of the root account. To do this, you can use the command `aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=Username,AttributeValue=root`. This will return a list of all API calls made by the root account.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can configure credentials by using the AWS CLI or by directly adding them to your script. However, it's not a good practice to hard code your credentials into your script.

```python
import boto3

aws_access_key_id = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'
aws_secret_access_key = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
aws_session_token = 'YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN'

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id,
    aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key,
    aws_session_token=aws_session_token,
)
```

3. Write a Python script to check Root Account Activity: You can use the AWS CloudTrail service to monitor the root account activity. CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services.

```python
import boto3

def check_root_account_activity():
    client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
    response = client.lookup_events(
        LookupAttributes=[
            {
                'AttributeKey': 'Username',
                'AttributeValue': 'root'
            },
        ],
        MaxResults=1
    )
    if 'Events' in response and len(response['Events']) > 0:
        print("Root account activity detected.")
    else:
        print("No root account activity detected.")

check_root_account_activity()
```

4. Run the Python script: Finally, you can run the Python script to check if there is any root account activity. If there is any activity, it will print "Root account activity detected." Otherwise, it will print "No root account activity detected."

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring root account activity in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to your AWS account using your root account credentials.

2. **Navigate to CloudTrail**: In the AWS Management Console, search for "CloudTrail" in the services search bar and click on the CloudTrail service.

3. **Create a new trail**: Click on the "Trails" option in the left-hand navigation pane, then click on the "Create trail" button.

4. **Configure trail settings**:
   - Enter a name for the trail (e.g., "RootAccountMonitoring").
   - Choose the S3 bucket where you want to store the CloudTrail logs.
   - Enable the option for "Read/Write events".
   - Click on "Create" to create the trail.

5. **Enable logging for the root account**: By default, CloudTrail logs all AWS account activity, including actions performed by the root account.

6. **Set up CloudWatch alarms** (optional): You can set up CloudWatch alarms to monitor specific API activity related to the root account. This can help you detect suspicious activity and respond quickly.

7. **Review and monitor the logs**: Regularly review the CloudTrail logs to monitor the activity of the root account and detect any unauthorized actions.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring root account activity in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console and enhance the security of your AWS account.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring root account activity in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Enable CloudTrail logging for the AWS account**:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to enable CloudTrail logging:
     ```
     aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <trail-name> --s3-bucket-name <bucket-name> --is-multi-region-trail
     ```
     Replace `<trail-name>` with a suitable name for the CloudTrail trail, and `<bucket-name>` with the name of the S3 bucket where CloudTrail logs will be stored.

2. **Enable logging for AWS Management Console sign-in events**:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to enable logging for AWS Management Console sign-in events:
     ```
     aws cloudtrail update-trail --name <trail-name> --enable-log-file-validation
     ```

3. **Configure CloudWatch Events for monitoring root account activity**:
   - Create a CloudWatch Events rule to monitor root account activity by running the following AWS CLI command:
     ```
     aws events put-rule --name MonitorRootAccountActivity --event-pattern "{\"source\": [\"aws.iam\"],\"detail-type\": [\"AWS API Call via CloudTrail\"],\"detail\":{\"userIdentity\":{\"type\":[\"Root\"]}}"
     ```
   
4. **Create a target for the CloudWatch Events rule**:
   - Create a target for the CloudWatch Events rule to specify the action to be taken when the rule is triggered. For example, you can send an SNS notification by running the following AWS CLI command:
     ```
     aws events put-targets --rule MonitorRootAccountActivity --targets "Id"="1","Arn"="<sns-topic-arn>"
     ```
     Replace `<sns-topic-arn>` with the ARN of the SNS topic where notifications will be sent.

5. **Enable the CloudWatch Events rule**:
   - Enable the CloudWatch Events rule to start monitoring root account activity by running the following AWS CLI command:
     ```
     aws events enable-rule --name MonitorRootAccountActivity
     ```

By following these steps, you will successfully remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring root account activity in AWS IAM using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring root account activity in AWS IAM using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Enable AWS CloudTrail for Root Account Activity Logging:**
   - Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to enable CloudTrail logging for the root account. Here's an example code snippet to enable CloudTrail logging:

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')

   response = client.update_trail(
       Name='your-cloudtrail-name',
       IncludeGlobalServiceEvents=True,
       IsMultiRegionTrail=True,
       EnableLogFileValidation=True
   )
   ```

2. **Set Up CloudWatch Alarms for Root Account Activity:**
   - Use Boto3 to create CloudWatch alarms that monitor root account activity. Here's an example code snippet to create a CloudWatch alarm for monitoring root account sign-in events:

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

   response = client.put_metric_alarm(
       AlarmName='RootAccountSignInAlarm',
       ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanThreshold',
       EvaluationPeriods=1,
       MetricName='SigninSuccesses',
       Namespace='AWS/CloudTrail',
       Period=300,
       Statistic='Sum',
       Threshold=0.0,
       ActionsEnabled=True,
       AlarmDescription='Alarm for Root Account Sign-In Events',
       Dimensions=[
           {
               'Name': 'EventName',
               'Value': 'ConsoleLogin'
           },
           {
               'Name': 'Username',
               'Value': 'root'
           }
       ],
       AlarmActions=[
           'arn:aws:sns:your-region:your-account-id:your-sns-topic'
       ]
   )
   ```

3. **Configure SNS Topic for CloudWatch Alarms:**
   - You need to create an SNS topic and subscribe to it to receive notifications for CloudWatch alarms. Here's an example code snippet to create an SNS topic:

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('sns')

   response = client.create_topic(
       Name='RootAccountActivityTopic'
   )

   topic_arn = response['TopicArn']

   response = client.subscribe(
       TopicArn=topic_arn,
       Protocol='email',
       Endpoint='your-email@example.com'
   )
   ```

By following these steps and regularly monitoring the CloudTrail logs and CloudWatch alarms, you can effectively remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring root account activity in AWS IAM using Python.
