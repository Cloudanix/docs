### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent blocked KMS actions in IAM policies using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to IAM Policies:**
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - In the navigation pane, choose "Policies" under the "Access management" section.

2. **Create or Edit a Policy:**
   - To create a new policy, click on the "Create policy" button.
   - To edit an existing policy, find the policy you want to modify and click on its name, then click the "Edit policy" button.

3. **Add KMS Permissions:**
   - In the policy editor, switch to the "JSON" tab.
   - Ensure that the policy includes the necessary KMS actions (e.g., `kms:Encrypt`, `kms:Decrypt`, `kms:GenerateDataKey`) and does not include any actions that should be blocked.
   - Example JSON snippet:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
             "kms:Encrypt",
             "kms:Decrypt",
             "kms:GenerateDataKey"
           ],
           "Resource": "*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

4. **Review and Save:**
   - After adding the necessary permissions, click on the "Review policy" button.
   - Provide a name and description for the policy if creating a new one.
   - Click on the "Create policy" or "Save changes" button to apply the policy.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your IAM policies are correctly configured to allow necessary KMS actions while preventing any blocked actions.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent blocked KMS actions in IAM policies using AWS CLI, you need to ensure that your IAM policies are correctly configured to allow necessary KMS actions and deny any inappropriate ones. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Create a JSON Policy Document:**
   - First, create a JSON policy document that specifies the allowed and denied KMS actions. Save this document locally, for example, as `kms_policy.json`.

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "kms:Encrypt",
           "kms:Decrypt",
           "kms:GenerateDataKey"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Deny",
         "Action": [
           "kms:DeleteKey",
           "kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Create or Update the IAM Policy:**
   - Use the AWS CLI to create a new IAM policy or update an existing one with the JSON policy document.

   ```sh
   aws iam create-policy --policy-name MyKMSPolicy --policy-document file://kms_policy.json
   ```

   If you need to update an existing policy, use:

   ```sh
   aws iam update-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/MyKMSPolicy --policy-document file://kms_policy.json
   ```

3. **Attach the Policy to IAM Users, Groups, or Roles:**
   - Attach the newly created or updated policy to the relevant IAM users, groups, or roles.

   ```sh
   aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name MyUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/MyKMSPolicy
   ```

   Similarly, for groups or roles:

   ```sh
   aws iam attach-group-policy --group-name MyGroup --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/MyKMSPolicy
   ```

   ```sh
   aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name MyRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/MyKMSPolicy
   ```

4. **Verify the Policy Attachment:**
   - Verify that the policy has been correctly attached to the IAM users, groups, or roles.

   ```sh
   aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name MyUser
   ```

   Similarly, for groups or roles:

   ```sh
   aws iam list-attached-group-policies --group-name MyGroup
   ```

   ```sh
   aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name MyRole
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your IAM policies are configured to allow necessary KMS actions while blocking potentially harmful ones.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent blocked KMS actions in IAM policies using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps to ensure that KMS actions are properly set in IAM policies:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**:
   Initialize the Boto3 client for IAM and KMS.
   ```python
   import boto3

   iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
   kms_client = boto3.client('kms')
   ```

3. **Retrieve and Update IAM Policies**:
   Retrieve the IAM policies and check for KMS actions. If they are not set correctly, update the policy.
   ```python
   def get_iam_policies():
       paginator = iam_client.get_paginator('list_policies')
       for response in paginator.paginate(Scope='Local'):
           for policy in response['Policies']:
               policy_arn = policy['Arn']
               policy_version = iam_client.get_policy_version(
                   PolicyArn=policy_arn,
                   VersionId=policy['DefaultVersionId']
               )
               yield policy_arn, policy_version['PolicyVersion']['Document']

   def update_policy(policy_arn, policy_document):
       # Add or modify the KMS actions in the policy document as needed
       # Example: Adding a statement to allow KMS actions
       kms_statement = {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
               "kms:Encrypt",
               "kms:Decrypt",
               "kms:GenerateDataKey"
           ],
           "Resource": "*"
       }
       policy_document['Statement'].append(kms_statement)
       
       # Update the policy with the new document
       iam_client.create_policy_version(
           PolicyArn=policy_arn,
           PolicyDocument=json.dumps(policy_document),
           SetAsDefault=True
       )

   for policy_arn, policy_document in get_iam_policies():
       update_policy(policy_arn, policy_document)
   ```

4. **Validate the Changes**:
   Ensure that the changes have been applied correctly by validating the updated policies.
   ```python
   def validate_policies():
       for policy_arn, policy_document in get_iam_policies():
           for statement in policy_document['Statement']:
               if 'kms:' in statement['Action']:
                   print(f"KMS actions are correctly set in policy: {policy_arn}")
               else:
                   print(f"KMS actions are missing in policy: {policy_arn}")

   validate_policies()
   ```

This script will help you ensure that KMS actions are properly set in IAM policies by retrieving existing policies, updating them if necessary, and validating the changes.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu, then choosing "IAM" under the "Security, Identity, & Compliance" category.
3. In the IAM dashboard, select "Policies" from the left-hand side menu. This will display a list of all the IAM policies currently in use.
4. For each policy, click on the policy name to open its details page. Here, you can review the policy's JSON document under the "Permissions" tab. Look for any KMS-related actions (like "kms:Encrypt", "kms:Decrypt", "kms:ReEncrypt*", etc.) that are explicitly denied. If such actions are found, it indicates that blocked KMS actions are set in the IAM policy.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access IAM policies.

2. Once AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the IAM policies using the following command:
   ```
   aws iam list-policies --scope Local
   ```
   This command will return a list of all IAM policies in your AWS account.

3. To check the details of each policy, you can use the following command:
   ```
   aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <Policy_ARN> --version-id <Policy_Version_ID>
   ```
   Replace `<Policy_ARN>` and `<Policy_Version_ID>` with the ARN and version ID of the policy you want to check. This command will return the details of the specified policy version.

4. Now, you need to manually inspect the policy details to check if there are any blocked KMS actions. Look for the "Effect": "Deny" statement in the policy document. If there are any KMS actions listed under this statement, it means those actions are blocked.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Setup AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to set up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your local environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, you need to configure it. You can do this by creating a new session using your AWS credentials:
   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       aws_session_token='SESSION_TOKEN',
   )
   ```
2. **List IAM Policies:**
   Use the `list_policies` method to retrieve all the IAM policies. This method returns a dictionary containing metadata about each IAM policy.
   ```python
   client = session.client('iam')
   policies = client.list_policies(Scope='All')
   ```
3. **Get Policy Details:**
   For each policy, use the `get_policy_version` method to retrieve the policy document. This method returns a dictionary containing the policy document.
   ```python
   for policy in policies['Policies']:
       default_version_id = policy['DefaultVersionId']
       policy_version = client.get_policy_version(
           PolicyArn=policy['Arn'],
           VersionId=default_version_id
       )
       policy_document = policy_version['PolicyVersion']['Document']
   ```
4. **Check for Blocked KMS Actions:**
   Parse the policy document and check if any KMS actions are blocked. If a policy blocks any KMS actions, print the policy name and the blocked actions.
   ```python
   for statement in policy_document['Statement']:
       if statement['Effect'] == 'Deny':
           for action in statement['Action']:
               if 'kms' in action:
                   print(f"Policy {policy['PolicyName']} blocks the following KMS action: {action}")
   ```
   This script will print the name of any policy that blocks KMS actions, along with the blocked actions.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of blocked KMS actions in IAM policies in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the IAM policy that is blocking KMS actions:
   
   Use the following AWS CLI command to list all IAM policies that have explicit deny statements for KMS actions:
   
   ```
   aws iam list-policies --query "Policies[?PolicyId != null].{PolicyName:PolicyName, PolicyId:PolicyId}" --output table
   ```
   
   Look for the IAM policy that is blocking KMS actions.

2. Update the IAM policy to allow the necessary KMS actions:

   Use the following AWS CLI command to update the IAM policy to allow the necessary KMS actions. Replace `POLICY_ARN` with the ARN of the IAM policy that needs to be updated and `KMS_ACTION` with the specific KMS action that needs to be allowed (e.g., `kms:Encrypt`):
   
   ```
   aws iam create-policy-version --policy-arn POLICY_ARN --policy-document '{
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "KMS_ACTION",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }'
   ```
   
   This command will create a new version of the IAM policy that allows the specified KMS action.

3. Set the new policy version as the default version:
   
   Use the following AWS CLI command to set the newly created policy version as the default version for the IAM policy. Replace `POLICY_ARN` with the ARN of the IAM policy that was updated:
   
   ```
   aws iam set-default-policy-version --policy-arn POLICY_ARN --version-id v2
   ```
   
   Replace `v2` with the version number of the policy version that was created in the previous step.

4. Verify the IAM policy changes:
   
   Use the following AWS CLI command to verify that the IAM policy now allows the necessary KMS actions. Replace `POLICY_ARN` with the ARN of the IAM policy that was updated:
   
   ```
   aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn POLICY_ARN --version-id v2
   ```
   
   This command will display the details of the updated IAM policy version, including the allowed KMS actions.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of blocked KMS actions in IAM policies in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in IAM policies in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the IAM policies that are blocking KMS actions:
   - You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all the IAM policies in your AWS account.
   - For each policy, check if it contains any explicit deny statements that block KMS actions.

2. Update the IAM policies to allow necessary KMS actions:
   - For policies that are blocking KMS actions, modify the policy to allow the required KMS actions.
   - You can use the `update_policy` method in Boto3 to update the IAM policy with the correct permissions.

3. Test the IAM policies:
   - After updating the IAM policies, test the permissions to ensure that the users or roles can now perform the necessary KMS actions.

Here is a sample Python script to remediate the blocked KMS actions in IAM policies:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the IAM client
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

# List all IAM policies
response = iam_client.list_policies()

for policy in response['Policies']:
    policy_arn = policy['Arn']
    
    # Get the policy document
    policy_version = iam_client.get_policy_version(
        PolicyArn=policy_arn,
        VersionId=policy['DefaultVersionId']
    )
    
    policy_document = policy_version['PolicyVersion']['Document']
    
    # Check if the policy contains explicit deny statements for KMS actions
    for statement in policy_document['Statement']:
        if statement.get('Effect') == 'Deny' and 'kms' in statement.get('Action', ''):
            # Update the policy to allow necessary KMS actions
            statement['Effect'] = 'Allow'
            
            # Update the policy with the modified document
            iam_client.create_policy_version(
                PolicyArn=policy_arn,
                PolicyDocument=policy_document,
                SetAsDefault=True
            )
            
            print(f"Policy {policy_arn} updated to allow KMS actions.")
```

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify IAM policies before running this script. Also, customize the script as per your specific requirements and policies in your AWS account.
