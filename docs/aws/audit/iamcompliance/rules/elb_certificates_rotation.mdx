How to enable certificate rotation for ELB.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using an account with administrative privileges.
2. Open the Amazon EC2 console by navigating to the EC2 service.
3. In the navigation pane, click on "Load Balancers" to view the list of your ELBs.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "ELB Certificates Should Be Rotated" Policy.)
4. Select the ELB for which you want to enable certificate rotation.
5. In the "Description" tab, click on the "Listeners" section to view the configured listeners for the ELB.
6. Identify the listener that is using the SSL/TLS certificate that you want to enable rotation for.
7. Note down the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the SSL/TLS certificate used by the listener. You will need this information later.
8. Open the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) console by navigating to the ACM service.
9. In the ACM console, click on "Certificates" in the navigation pane.
10. Locate the SSL/TLS certificate associated with the ARN you noted down earlier.
11. Select the checkbox next to the certificate to activate the actions menu.
12. Click on "Actions" and then select "Enable rotation" from the dropdown menu.
13. A dialog box will appear to confirm enabling rotation. Click on "Enable" to proceed.
14. Certificate rotation is now enabled for the selected SSL/TLS certificate.
15. Go back to the EC2 console and select the ELB again.
16. In the "Description" tab, click on the "Listeners" section.
17. Click on the pencil icon or "Edit" button next to the listener that uses the certificate.
18. In the "SSL certificate" section, select "Choose a certificate from ACM (recommended)".
19. Select the appropriate region and search for the SSL/TLS certificate that supports rotation.
20. Select the certificate from the list and click on "Save".
21. The listener is now updated to use the certificate that supports rotation.
