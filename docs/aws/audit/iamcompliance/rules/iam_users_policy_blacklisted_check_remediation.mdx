1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Policies". This will open a list of all the IAM policies that are currently configured in your AWS environment.

3. Select the policy you want to check for blocked KMS actions. This will open the policy details page.

4. In the policy details page, check the policy document for any "Deny" statements that are applied to KMS actions. If there are any "Deny" statements applied to KMS actions, then the policy is blocking those actions.

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute IAM related commands.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the IAM policies using the following command:
   ```
   aws iam list-policies --scope Local
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the IAM policies that are created within your AWS account.

3. For each policy, you can get the policy details including the policy document by using the following command:
   ```
   aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <Policy_ARN> --version-id <Policy_Version_ID>
   ```
   Replace `<Policy_ARN>` with the ARN of the policy and `<Policy_Version_ID>` with the version ID of the policy. This command will return the policy document which includes the permissions set by the policy.

4. Now, you need to check the policy document for any blocked KMS actions. You can do this by looking for "kms:Deny" statements in the policy document. If you find any such statements, it means that some KMS actions are blocked in the inline policy. You can use a JSON parser or a script to automate this process. For example, in Python, you can use the `json` module to parse the policy document and check for blocked KMS actions.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install and configure Boto3 to interact with AWS services. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials either by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```
   Or, you can create the credential file yourself at ~/.aws/credentials. At a minimum, it should look like this:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

2. Use Boto3 to list all IAM policies:
   You can use the `list_policies` method to retrieve all IAM policies. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # List policies
   response = iam.list_policies(Scope='All')
   for policy in response['Policies']:
       print(policy['PolicyName'])
   ```

3. Get the policy details:
   For each policy, you can use the `get_policy` method to retrieve the policy details, including the policy document. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # Get policy
   response = iam.get_policy(PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess')
   policy_document = response['Policy']['PolicyDocument']
   print(policy_document)
   ```

4. Check for blocked KMS actions:
   You can parse the policy document to check if it contains any blocked KMS actions. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3
   import json

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # Get policy
   response = iam.get_policy(PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess')
   policy_document = response['Policy']['PolicyDocument']

   # Parse policy document
   policy_document = json.loads(policy_document)

   # Check for blocked KMS actions
   for statement in policy_document['Statement']:
       if 'kms:Decrypt' in statement['Action'] and statement['Effect'] == 'Deny':
           print('Blocked KMS action found: kms:Decrypt')
   ```
   This script checks if the 'kms:Decrypt' action is blocked. You can modify it to check for other KMS actions.

### Remediation
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Identify the Inline Policies**: 
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
   - In the navigation pane, choose "Policies".
   - Select the policy that contains the inline policy with blocked KMS actions.

2. **Edit the Inline Policy**:
   - Click on the policy name to open the policy details.
   - In the "Policy summary" section, find the inline policy that contains the blocked KMS actions.
   - Click on the "Edit policy" button to modify the inline policy.

3. **Update the Policy Document**:
   - In the policy editor, locate the section that specifies the actions allowed or denied.
   - Remove any explicit denies for KMS actions that are necessary for your use case.
   - Ensure that the policy allows the required KMS actions by using the appropriate IAM policy actions (e.g., kms:Encrypt, kms:Decrypt, kms:GenerateDataKey, etc.).

4. **Review and Save the Changes**:
   - After updating the policy document to allow the necessary KMS actions, review the changes to ensure they meet your security and access requirements.
   - Click on the "Review policy" button to validate the policy syntax.
   - Once the policy syntax is valid, click on the "Save changes" button to update the inline policy.

5. **Test the Policy**:
   - After saving the changes, test the inline policy to ensure that the required KMS actions are now allowed.
   - You can test the policy by assigning it to a user or role and performing the relevant actions that involve KMS encryption/decryption.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console. It is essential to regularly review and update IAM policies to ensure that they align with your organization's security and compliance requirements.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the IAM user or role with inline policies that contain blocked KMS actions.

2. Open your terminal and execute the following AWS CLI command to list all IAM users and roles with inline policies that contain blocked KMS actions:
   ```
   aws iam list-entities-for-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUserPolicy
   ```

3. Identify the inline policy attached to the IAM user or role that contains blocked KMS actions.

4. Modify the inline policy to allow the necessary KMS actions. You can do this by creating a new inline policy with the required KMS permissions and attaching it to the IAM user or role.

5. Use the AWS CLI command to create a new inline policy with the required KMS permissions. Save the policy document in a JSON file (e.g., kms_policy.json) with the necessary permissions. Here is an example of a policy document that allows all KMS actions:
   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "kms:*",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

6. Execute the following AWS CLI command to attach the new inline policy to the IAM user or role:
   ```
   aws iam put-user-policy --user-name <IAM-USER-NAME> --policy-name AllowKMSActions --policy-document file://kms_policy.json
   ```

7. Verify that the new inline policy with the required KMS permissions has been successfully attached to the IAM user or role by listing the user policies:
   ```
   aws iam list-user-policies --user-name <IAM-USER-NAME>
   ```

8. Test the IAM user or role to ensure that they can now perform the necessary KMS actions without any issues.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the IAM user or role with the inline policy that is blocking KMS actions.
2. Update the inline policy to allow the necessary KMS actions.

Here is an example Python script that demonstrates how to remediate this issue:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the IAM client
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

# Specify the IAM user or role name with the inline policy blocking KMS actions
user_or_role_name = 'YOUR_USER_OR_ROLE_NAME'

# Specify the KMS actions that need to be allowed
kms_actions = ['kms:Encrypt', 'kms:Decrypt', 'kms:GenerateDataKey']

# Get the inline policies attached to the IAM user or role
response = iam_client.list_user_policies(UserName=user_or_role_name)
policy_names = response['PolicyNames']

# Update each inline policy to allow the necessary KMS actions
for policy_name in policy_names:
    policy_document = iam_client.get_user_policy(UserName=user_or_role_name, PolicyName=policy_name)['PolicyDocument']
    for statement in policy_document['Statement']:
        if statement['Effect'] == 'Deny' and 'kms' in statement['Action']:
            for action in kms_actions:
                statement['Action'].remove(action)
    
    # Update the policy with the modified document
    iam_client.put_user_policy(UserName=user_or_role_name, PolicyName=policy_name, PolicyDocument=policy_document)

print(f"KMS actions have been allowed in the inline policies for {user_or_role_name}")
```

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_USER_OR_ROLE_NAME'` with the actual IAM user or role name that has the inline policy blocking KMS actions. Also, update the `kms_actions` list with the specific KMS actions that need to be allowed.

By running this Python script, you will be able to remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies for the specified IAM user or role in AWS IAM.
