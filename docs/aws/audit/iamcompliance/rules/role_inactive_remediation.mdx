1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Roles". This will display a list of all the IAM roles that are currently configured within your AWS environment.

3. Select a role to inspect. In the "Last activity" column, you can see when the role was last used to make an AWS request. If the "Last activity" shows "None", it means the role has not been used to make a request.

4. Repeat this process for all roles in the list. Any role that has not been used recently (based on your organization's policy, e.g., 90 days) can be considered as inactive and should be reviewed for potential removal.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Once you have AWS CLI installed and configured, you can proceed to the next steps.

2. Use the following command to list all the IAM roles in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws iam list-roles
   ```
   This command will return a JSON object that contains information about all the IAM roles in your AWS account.

3. To check the last activity of each role, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws iam get-role --role-name {role-name}
   ```
   Replace `{role-name}` with the name of the role you want to check. This command will return a JSON object that contains information about the specified role, including the `RoleLastUsed` field which indicates the last time the role was used.

4. Repeat step 3 for each role listed in step 2. If the `RoleLastUsed` field is not present or the date is older than your company's policy (for example, 90 days), the role is considered inactive.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS services. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating the files ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config:

   ~/.aws/credentials:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

   ~/.aws/config:
   ```
   [default]
   region=us-east-1
   ```

3. Write a Python script to detect inactive IAM roles: The following script lists all IAM roles and checks if they have been used in the last 90 days. If not, it prints them out:

   ```python
   import boto3
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # Get the current date
   current_date = datetime.now()

   # Get all IAM roles
   roles = iam.list_roles()['Roles']

   # Check each role
   for role in roles:
       # Get the role name
       role_name = role['RoleName']

       # Get the last used date of the role
       last_used_date = role.get('RoleLastUsed', {}).get('LastUsedDate')

       # If the role has never been used, print it out
       if last_used_date is None:
           print(f"The role {role_name} has never been used.")
           continue

       # If the role has not been used in the last 90 days, print it out
       if last_used_date < current_date - timedelta(days=90):
           print(f"The role {role_name} has not been used in the last 90 days.")
   ```

4. Run the Python script: You can run the script using the Python interpreter. The script will print out all IAM roles that have not been used in the last 90 days:

   ```
   python detect_inactive_roles.py
   ```

This script only detects inactive IAM roles. To remove them, you would need to add additional code to delete the roles or manually remove them through the AWS Management Console.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the "Inactive Roles Should Be Removed" misconfiguration in AWS:

1. Login to your AWS console.
2. Navigate to the "Identity and Access Management (IAM)" service.
3. Click on "Roles" from the left-hand menu.
4. Review the list of roles and identify any inactive roles.
5. Select the inactive role by clicking on the role name.
6. Click on the "Delete Role" button.
7. Confirm the deletion by clicking on "Yes, delete" button.

Note: Before deleting any role, make sure that the role is not being used by any resources or services in your AWS account. If a role is being used, then removing it can cause disruption to the resources or services.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Inactive Roles Should Be Removed" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your computer.

2. Run the following command to list all the roles in your AWS account:

```
aws iam list-roles
```

3. Identify the inactive roles that have not been used for a long time. You can check the "LastUsedDate" attribute of each role to determine when it was last used.

4. Run the following command to delete the inactive roles:

```
aws iam delete-role --role-name <role-name>
```

Replace `<role-name>` with the name of the inactive role that you want to delete.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all the inactive roles that you want to remove.

Note: Before deleting any role, make sure that it is not being used by any resources or applications in your AWS account. Deleting a role that is still in use can cause issues with your applications and services.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of inactive roles in AWS, you can use the following steps using Python:

1. First, you need to list all the roles in your AWS account using the `boto3` library in Python. You can use the following code to achieve this:

```python
import boto3

# Create an IAM client
iam = boto3.client('iam')

# List roles
response = iam.list_roles()
roles = response['Roles']
```

2. Once you have the list of roles, you need to check if any of the roles are inactive. You can do this by checking the `CreateDate` attribute of the role. If the role was created more than a certain number of days ago (e.g. 90 days), you can consider it inactive. You can use the following code to achieve this:

```python
import datetime

# Define the number of days after which a role is considered inactive
inactive_days = 90

# Check if any roles are inactive
for role in roles:
    create_date = role['CreateDate'].replace(tzinfo=None)
    if (datetime.datetime.now() - create_date).days > inactive_days:
        print(f"Role {role['RoleName']} is inactive and should be removed.")
```

3. Finally, to remove the inactive roles, you can use the `delete_role` method of the `boto3` library. You can use the following code to achieve this:

```python
# Delete inactive roles
for role in roles:
    create_date = role['CreateDate'].replace(tzinfo=None)
    if (datetime.datetime.now() - create_date).days > inactive_days:
        iam.delete_role(RoleName=role['RoleName'])
        print(f"Role {role['RoleName']} has been deleted.")
```

Note: Before running the above code, make sure you have the necessary IAM permissions to delete roles.
