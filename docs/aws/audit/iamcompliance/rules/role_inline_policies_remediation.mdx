### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Roles". This will display a list of all the IAM roles that are currently configured in your AWS environment.

3. Click on the name of the role that you want to check for inline policies. This will open the summary page for that role.

4. In the "Permissions" tab, look for the "Inline Policies" section. If there are any inline policies attached to the role, they will be listed here. If this section is empty, then the role does not have any inline policies.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Once you have AWS CLI installed and configured, you can start using it to interact with AWS services.

2. To list all the IAM roles in your AWS account, use the following command:

   ```
   aws iam list-roles
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object that contains all the IAM roles in your AWS account.

3. To check if a role has inline policies, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws iam list-role-policies --role-name {role-name}
   ```

   Replace `{role-name}` with the name of the role you want to check. This command will return a list of all inline policies attached to the specified role. If the list is empty, it means that the role does not have any inline policies.

4. Repeat step 3 for each role in your AWS account. If any role has inline policies, it means that there is a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3, AWS EC2, AWS DynamoDB, and much more. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```
You also need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create an IAM client:

```python
import boto3

# Create IAM client
iam = boto3.client('iam')
```

3. List all IAM roles and check for inline policies:

```python
# List all IAM roles
roles = iam.list_roles()
for role in roles['Roles']:
    role_name = role['RoleName']
    
    # List inline policies for each role
    inline_policies = iam.list_role_policies(RoleName=role_name)
    
    # If there are any inline policies, print a message
    if inline_policies['PolicyNames']:
        print(f"Role {role_name} has inline policies.")
```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using any Python interpreter. If any roles have inline policies, they will be printed to the console. This script only checks for the existence of inline policies, not their contents. If you need to check the contents of the policies, you can use the `get_role_policy` method.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Roles Should Not Have Inline Policies" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS Console, please follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the IAM console.
3. In the navigation pane, choose "Roles".
4. Select the role that has an inline policy attached to it.
5. Choose the "Permissions" tab.
6. Scroll down to the "Inline Policies" section.
7. Click on the inline policy that you want to remove.
8. Choose "Delete Policy".
9. Confirm that you want to delete the policy by clicking on "Delete".
10. Repeat steps 7-9 for all inline policies attached to the role.
11. After all inline policies have been removed, click on the "Policies" tab.
12. Click on "Create Policy".
13. Choose "Create Your Own Policy".
14. Enter a name for the policy and a description (optional).
15. In the "Policy Document" section, enter the policy JSON code that defines the permissions for the role.
16. Click on "Create Policy".
17. Go back to the "Roles" page and select the role that you just created the policy for.
18. Choose the "Permissions" tab.
19. Click on "Attach Policies".
20. Select the policy that you just created and click on "Attach Policy".
21. Verify that the role no longer has any inline policies attached to it and that it has a policy attached to it via the "Policies" tab.

Congratulations! You have successfully remediated the "Roles Should Not Have Inline Policies" misconfiguration in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue "Roles Should Not Have Inline Policies" in AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. List all the IAM roles in your AWS account using the following command:
```
aws iam list-roles
```

2. For each role, check if it has any inline policies attached to it using the following command:
```
aws iam list-role-policies --role-name <ROLE_NAME>
```

3. If the above command returns any inline policies, create a managed policy for the same using the following command:
```
aws iam create-policy --policy-name <POLICY_NAME> --policy-document file://<POLICY_DOCUMENT_FILE_PATH>
```
Note: Replace `<POLICY_NAME>` with a suitable name for the policy and `<POLICY_DOCUMENT_FILE_PATH>` with the path to the JSON policy document.

4. Attach the newly created managed policy to the role using the following command:
```
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name <ROLE_NAME> --policy-arn <POLICY_ARN>
```
Note: Replace `<POLICY_ARN>` with the ARN of the newly created managed policy and `<ROLE_NAME>` with the name of the role to which the policy needs to be attached.

5. Finally, remove the inline policy from the role using the following command:
```
aws iam delete-role-policy --role-name <ROLE_NAME> --policy-name <POLICY_NAME>
```
Note: Replace `<POLICY_NAME>` with the name of the inline policy and `<ROLE_NAME>` with the name of the role from which the policy needs to be removed.

Repeat the above steps for all the roles that have inline policies attached to them to remediate the issue "Roles Should Not Have Inline Policies" in AWS.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Roles Should Not Have Inline Policies" misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to identify the roles that have inline policies. You can achieve this by using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and the IAM client. You can use the `list_roles()` method to list all the roles in your AWS account, and then use the `get_role_policy()` method to get the policies attached to each role. If the policy is inline, you can add it to a list of inline policies.

```python
import boto3

iam = boto3.client('iam')

inline_policies = []

roles = iam.list_roles()['Roles']

for role in roles:
    policies = iam.list_role_policies(RoleName=role['RoleName'])['PolicyNames']
    for policy_name in policies:
        policy = iam.get_role_policy(RoleName=role['RoleName'], PolicyName=policy_name)
        if 'PolicyDocument' in policy and 'Version' in policy['PolicyDocument']:
            if policy['PolicyDocument']['Version'] == '2012-10-17':
                inline_policies.append(policy_name)
```

2. Once you have identified the roles with inline policies, you can remove them using the `delete_role_policy()` method. You can loop through the list of roles and policies and delete each inline policy.

```python
for role in roles:
    for policy_name in inline_policies:
        try:
            iam.delete_role_policy(RoleName=role['RoleName'], PolicyName=policy_name)
            print(f"Inline policy {policy_name} removed from role {role['RoleName']}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error removing inline policy {policy_name} from role {role['RoleName']}: {e}")
```

3. Finally, you can verify that the inline policies have been removed by repeating step 1 and checking that the list of inline policies is empty.

```python
inline_policies = []

for role in roles:
    policies = iam.list_role_policies(RoleName=role['RoleName'])['PolicyNames']
    for policy_name in policies:
        policy = iam.get_role_policy(RoleName=role['RoleName'], PolicyName=policy_name)
        if 'PolicyDocument' in policy and 'Version' in policy['PolicyDocument']:
            if policy['PolicyDocument']['Version'] == '2012-10-17':
                inline_policies.append(policy_name)

if not inline_policies:
    print("All inline policies have been removed from roles")
else:
    print(f"Inline policies still exist: {inline_policies}")
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Roles Should Not Have Inline Policies" misconfiguration in AWS using Python.
