1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as a root user.
2. In the navigation pane, choose "IAM" to open the IAM dashboard.
3. In the IAM dashboard, you will find the "Security Status" section. Here, you can see the status of MFA on your root account. If it's not enabled, it will show a warning sign.
4. To confirm, click on the "Manage MFA" button. If MFA is not enabled, it will show "Multi-factor authentication (MFA): Not enabled".
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all IAM users: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the IAM users in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws iam list-users
   ```

   This command will return a list of all IAM users along with their details.

3. Check MFA devices for each user: For each user returned in the previous step, you need to check if they have any MFA devices enabled. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username>
   ```

   Replace `<username>` with the name of the IAM user. This command will return a list of all MFA devices associated with the specified user.

4. Analyze the output: If the output from the previous command is empty, it means that the user does not have MFA enabled. If the output contains one or more MFA devices, it means that the user has MFA enabled. Repeat this process for all IAM users to check if the root account has MFA enabled.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    aws_session_token='SESSION_TOKEN',
)
```

3. Now, you can use the IAM client to list all the virtual MFA devices:

```python
iam = session.client('iam')

mfa_devices = iam.list_virtual_mfa_devices()
```

4. Finally, you can iterate over the MFA devices and check if the root account has one:

```python
root_account_mfa = False

for device in mfa_devices['VirtualMFADevices']:
    if 'RootAccountMFADevice' in device['SerialNumber']:
        root_account_mfa = True
        break

if root_account_mfa:
    print("Root account has MFA enabled.")
else:
    print("Root account does not have MFA enabled.")
```

This script will print whether the root account has MFA enabled or not. If it does not, then this is a misconfiguration that should be fixed.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**.
2. **Navigate to the IAM service**.
3. **Select Users from the navigation pane**.
4. **Identify the root user**:
   - Locate the user with the username "root".
5. **Enable MFA**:
   - Click on the root user.
   - Go to the Security credentials tab.
   - Under Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), click on Manage MFA.
   - Follow the prompts to set up MFA for the root user.
6. **Repeat for other root users**:
   - If there are multiple root users, repeat the above steps for each of them.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. **Enable MFA for the Root User**:
```bash
aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name root --authentication-code1 MFA_CODE_1 --authentication-code2 MFA_CODE_2
```
Replace `MFA_CODE_1` and `MFA_CODE_2` with the two MFA codes generated by the MFA device.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
Here's a Python script to enable MFA for the root AWS account:

```python
import boto3

class MFAChecker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

    def enable_mfa_for_root(self, mfa_code1, mfa_code2):
        self.iam_client.enable_mfa_device(
            UserName='root',
            SerialNumber='arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:mfa/root',
            AuthenticationCode1=mfa_code1,
            AuthenticationCode2=mfa_code2
        )
        print("MFA has been enabled for the root user.")

# Instantiate the class
checker = MFAChecker()

# Provide the MFA codes
mfa_code1 = '111111'  # Example MFA code 1
mfa_code2 = '222222'  # Example MFA code 2

# Enable MFA for the root user
checker.enable_mfa_for_root(mfa_code1, mfa_code2)
```

Ensure to replace `'111111'` and `'222222'` with the actual MFA codes generated by the MFA device.

Make sure to have appropriate IAM permissions for managing MFA devices if you're using AWS CLI or Python script.
