How to enable root account MFA?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your root account credentials.
2. Navigate to the IAM service by searching for "IAM" in the AWS services search bar and selecting "IAM" from the results.
3. In the IAM dashboard, click on "Users" in the left sidebar.
4. Locate the root account user and click on its username.
5. In the user details page, navigate to the "Security credentials" tab.
6. Under the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, click on the "Manage MFA" button.
7. On the "Manage MFA Device" page, click on the "Continue" button.
8. Select the type of MFA device you want to use. You have two options:
   - Virtual MFA device: Use a smartphone app (such as Google Authenticator or Authy) to generate MFA codes.
   - U2F security key: Use a hardware key (such as a YubiKey) for MFA authentication.
   Choose the option that suits your preferences and requirements.
9. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the selected MFA device type.
   - For a virtual MFA device, you will need to scan a QR code or manually enter a secret key into the authenticator app.
   - For a U2F security key, you will need to insert the hardware key into a USB port and follow the instructions for registration.
10. After setting up the MFA device, you will be prompted to enter the authentication code from your device to verify the setup.
11. Once the MFA setup is verified, you can review the summary and click on the "Finish" button to complete the process.
12. The MFA will now be enabled for your AWS root account.
