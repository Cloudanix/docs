<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the complex password policy for AWS using AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the IAM service.
3. Select the account that requires the complex password policy.
4. Click on the "Password Policy" tab.
5. Update the password policy by setting the following parameters:
   - Minimum password length to 8 or more characters.
   - Require at least one uppercase letter.
   - Require at least one lowercase letter.
   - Require at least one number.
   - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character.
6. Click on the "Apply password policy" button to save the changes.

After following these steps, the complex password policy will be enabled for the AWS account.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to update the password policy:

```
aws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 12 --require-symbols --require-numbers --require-uppercase-characters --require-lowercase-characters --allow-users-to-change-password --max-password-age 90 --password-reuse-prevention 24
```

This command sets the minimum password length to 12 characters and requires symbols, numbers, uppercase and lowercase characters in the password. It also allows users to change their passwords, sets the maximum password age to 90 days, and prevents users from reusing their last 24 passwords.

3. Verify that the password policy has been updated by running the following command:

```
aws iam get-account-password-policy
```

This command will return the current password policy for your AWS account.

4. Repeat this process for all AWS accounts in your organization to ensure that all accounts have a complex password policy in place.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not having a complex password policy in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the complex password policy misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries for AWS SDK and Boto3:

```
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Create a boto3 client for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):

```
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
```

3. Define the password policy that you want to enforce. For example, you can enforce a password policy that requires a minimum password length of 12 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character:

```
password_policy = {
    'MinimumPasswordLength': 12,
    'RequireUppercaseCharacters': True,
    'RequireLowercaseCharacters': True,
    'RequireNumbers': True,
    'RequireSymbols': True
}
```

4. Update the password policy for your AWS account using the `update_account_password_policy` method of the IAM client:

```
try:
    response = iam_client.update_account_password_policy(**password_policy)
    print('Password policy updated successfully.')
except ClientError as e:
    print(e)
```

5. Verify that the password policy has been updated by retrieving the current password policy using the `get_account_password_policy` method of the IAM client:

```
try:
    response = iam_client.get_account_password_policy()
    print(response['PasswordPolicy'])
except ClientError as e:
    print(e)
```

This should remediate the complex password policy misconfiguration in AWS using Python.
