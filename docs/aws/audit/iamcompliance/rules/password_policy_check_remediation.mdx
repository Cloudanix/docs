### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Account Settings". 

3. In the "Password Policy" section, you can see the current password policy details. 

4. Check if the password policy includes the following: 
   - Require at least one uppercase letter from Latin alphabet (A-Z)
   - Require at least one lowercase letter from Latin alphabet (a-z)
   - Require at least one number
   - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character
   - Enable password expiration
   - Prevent password reuse

If these conditions are not met, then the complex password policy is not present in IAM.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List IAM Password Policies: Use the AWS CLI command `aws iam get-account-password-policy` to retrieve the account's password policy. This command does not require any parameters. Here is an example of how to use it:

   ```
   aws iam get-account-password-policy
   ```

3. Analyze the output: The output of the command will be in JSON format. You need to check the following fields: `MinimumPasswordLength`, `RequireSymbols`, `RequireNumbers`, `RequireUppercaseCharacters`, and `RequireLowercaseCharacters`. If these fields are not set to true or if the `MinimumPasswordLength` is less than a certain number (e.g., 12), then the password policy is not complex enough.

4. Automate the process: You can write a Python script that uses the AWS SDK (boto3) to automatically check the password policy. The script would use the `get_account_password_policy` method from the `IAM` client to retrieve the password policy and then check the fields mentioned in step 3. If the policy does not meet the requirements, the script could print a message or send an alert.

#### Using Python

To check if a complex password policy is present in IAM using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to directly interact with AWS services, including IAM. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the Boto3 library in Python:**
   Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. To use Boto3, you first need to import it.

   ```python
   import boto3
   ```

2. **Create an IAM client:**
   You can create an IAM client using the `boto3.client()` function. This function requires the name of the AWS service you want to access. In this case, it's 'iam'.

   ```python
   iam = boto3.client('iam')
   ```

3. **Retrieve the account password policy:**
   You can retrieve the account password policy using the `get_account_password_policy()` function. This function returns a dictionary that contains the details of the password policy.

   ```python
   try:
       response = iam.get_account_password_policy()
   except Exception as e:
       print("No password policy found.")
   ```

4. **Check the complexity of the password policy:**
   The dictionary returned by `get_account_password_policy()` contains several keys that represent different aspects of the password policy. You can check the complexity of the password policy by checking the values of these keys.

   ```python
   if 'PasswordPolicy' in response:
       policy = response['PasswordPolicy']
       if policy['MinimumPasswordLength'] < 14 or not policy['RequireSymbols'] or not policy['RequireNumbers'] or not policy['RequireUppercaseCharacters'] or not policy['RequireLowercaseCharacters']:
           print("Password policy is not complex enough.")
       else:
           print("Password policy is complex.")
   else:
       print("No password policy found.")
   ```

This script checks if the password policy requires a minimum length of 14 characters, and if it requires at least one symbol, number, uppercase character, and lowercase character. If the policy doesn't meet these requirements, the script prints a message saying that the password policy is not complex enough.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the complex password policy for AWS using AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the IAM service.
3. Select the account that requires the complex password policy.
4. Click on the "Password Policy" tab.
5. Update the password policy by setting the following parameters:
   - Minimum password length to 8 or more characters.
   - Require at least one uppercase letter.
   - Require at least one lowercase letter.
   - Require at least one number.
   - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character.
6. Click on the "Apply password policy" button to save the changes.

After following these steps, the complex password policy will be enabled for the AWS account.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to update the password policy:

```
aws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 12 --require-symbols --require-numbers --require-uppercase-characters --require-lowercase-characters --allow-users-to-change-password --max-password-age 90 --password-reuse-prevention 24
```

This command sets the minimum password length to 12 characters and requires symbols, numbers, uppercase and lowercase characters in the password. It also allows users to change their passwords, sets the maximum password age to 90 days, and prevents users from reusing their last 24 passwords.

3. Verify that the password policy has been updated by running the following command:

```
aws iam get-account-password-policy
```

This command will return the current password policy for your AWS account.

4. Repeat this process for all AWS accounts in your organization to ensure that all accounts have a complex password policy in place.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not having a complex password policy in AWS.

#### Using Python

To remediate the complex password policy misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries for AWS SDK and Boto3:

```
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Create a boto3 client for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):

```
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
```

3. Define the password policy that you want to enforce. For example, you can enforce a password policy that requires a minimum password length of 12 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character:

```
password_policy = {
    'MinimumPasswordLength': 12,
    'RequireUppercaseCharacters': True,
    'RequireLowercaseCharacters': True,
    'RequireNumbers': True,
    'RequireSymbols': True
}
```

4. Update the password policy for your AWS account using the `update_account_password_policy` method of the IAM client:

```
try:
    response = iam_client.update_account_password_policy(**password_policy)
    print('Password policy updated successfully.')
except ClientError as e:
    print(e)
```

5. Verify that the password policy has been updated by retrieving the current password policy using the `get_account_password_policy` method of the IAM client:

```
try:
    response = iam_client.get_account_password_policy()
    print(response['PasswordPolicy'])
except ClientError as e:
    print(e)
```

This should remediate the complex password policy misconfiguration in AWS using Python.
