How to ensure AWS account has minimum admins.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Use the principle of least privilege: Grant only the necessary permissions to users or roles based on their specific responsibilities. Avoid giving broad and unrestricted administrative privileges to users unless absolutely required.
2. Implement role-based access control (RBAC): Define roles that align with specific job functions and assign appropriate permissions to those roles. This approach allows you to grant permissions based on job responsibilities rather than individual users.
3. Follow the separation of duties: Implement a separation of duties policy where different users or roles are responsible for different aspects of your AWS environment. This helps distribute administrative tasks and reduces the risk of unauthorized actions.
4. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enforce the use of MFA for all user accounts, especially for accounts with administrative privileges. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring an additional authentication factor, such as a physical device or mobile app, in addition to a password.
5. Regularly review and audit user privileges: Conduct periodic reviews of user permissions to ensure they are still necessary and appropriate. Remove or adjust permissions for users who no longer require administrative access.
6. Monitor and log administrative activities: Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture logs of API calls and AWS Management Console actions. Regularly review these logs for any unusual or unauthorized activities performed by administrators.
7. Implement least-privileged access for cross-account access: If you need to grant administrative access to users from another AWS account, follow the least-privileged access approach. Use roles and policies to provide only the necessary permissions, and avoid sharing long-term access keys.
8. Limit root account usage: The root account has full access to all AWS resources and should be used only for initial account setup or emergency situations. Create and use individual IAM users or roles with appropriate permissions for day-to-day administrative tasks.

By following these best practices, you can minimize the number of administrators in your AWS account, reduce the risk of unauthorized access, and improve the overall security of your environment.
