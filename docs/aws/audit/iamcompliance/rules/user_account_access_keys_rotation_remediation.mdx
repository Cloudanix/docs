<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of user account access keys not being rotated in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your IAM user credentials.
2. Navigate to the IAM service.
3. Click on "Users" from the left-hand menu.
4. Select the user whose access keys need to be rotated.
5. Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
6. Under "Access keys", you will see the list of access keys associated with that user.
7. Click on the "Make inactive" button next to the access key that needs to be rotated.
8. Once the access key is inactive, click on the "Create access key" button.
9. A new access key will be generated. Download the access key file and store it securely.
10. Update the access key in all the applications and scripts where it is used.
11. Once all the applications/scripts have been updated, delete the old access key.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration of user account access keys not being rotated in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of User Account Access keys not being rotated in AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the IAM user(s) whose access keys need to be rotated. You can do this by running the following command:
```
aws iam list-users
```

2. Once you have identified the user(s), create a new access key for them by running the following command:
```
aws iam create-access-key --user-name <IAM-USERNAME>
```
Note: Replace `<IAM-USERNAME>` with the actual IAM username for which you want to create a new access key.

3. After creating the new access key, update the IAM user(s) to use the new access key and disable the old access key by running the following command:
```
aws iam update-access-key --access-key-id <OLD-ACCESS-KEY-ID> --status Inactive --user-name <IAM-USERNAME>
```
Note: Replace `<OLD-ACCESS-KEY-ID>` with the actual access key ID that needs to be disabled and `<IAM-USERNAME>` with the actual IAM username for which you want to disable the old access key.

4. Verify that the new access key is working by running the following command:
```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

5. Once you have verified that the new access key is working, delete the old access key by running the following command:
```
aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id <OLD-ACCESS-KEY-ID> --user-name <IAM-USERNAME>
```
Note: Replace `<OLD-ACCESS-KEY-ID>` with the actual access key ID that needs to be deleted and `<IAM-USERNAME>` with the actual IAM username for which you want to delete the old access key.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of User Account Access keys not being rotated in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of User Account Access keys should be rotated in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Create a Python script that uses the AWS SDK boto3 to rotate the access keys for IAM users.

2. Install the boto3 package using pip install boto3 command.

3. Use the boto3 client to list all the IAM users in the AWS account using the following code:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('iam')

response = client.list_users()

for user in response['Users']:
    print('IAM user: ' + user['UserName'])
```

4. For each IAM user, use the boto3 client to generate a new access key and then delete the old access key using the following code:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('iam')

response = client.list_access_keys(UserName='IAM_user_name')

for access_key in response['AccessKeyMetadata']:
    print('Deleting access key: ' + access_key['AccessKeyId'])
    client.delete_access_key(UserName='IAM_user_name', AccessKeyId=access_key['AccessKeyId'])

response = client.create_access_key(UserName='IAM_user_name')

print('New access key:\n' + 'AccessKeyId: ' + response['AccessKey']['AccessKeyId'] + '\nSecretAccessKey: ' + response['AccessKey']['SecretAccessKey'])
```

5. Run the Python script to rotate the access keys for all IAM users in the AWS account.

Note: Before running the script, ensure that you have the appropriate IAM permissions to create and delete access keys for IAM users.
