How to change outdated IAM access keys?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the left navigation panel, choose Users. Click on the IAM user name that you want to examine.

- Step 2: On the IAM user configuration page, select Security Credentials tab. Click Create Access Key to create a new set of access keys that replaces the old ones.

- Step 3: In the Create Access Key dialog box, click Download Credentials to save the newly created access key ID and secret access key to a CSV file on your machine. (!) IMPORTANT: AWS IAM will not provide access to the new secret access key again once the Create Access Key dialog box closes so make sure you save your credentials in a safe location on your machine.

- Step 4: Click Close to close the dialog box and return to the configuration page. The IAM user should have now two active access keys.

- Step 5: Now update your application(s) code and replace the existing access key ID and secret access key with the new ones. Test your application(s) to make sure that the new access key pair is working.

- Step 6: Once the new key is validated, return to the IAM user configuration page, select the outdated (previous) key and click Make Inactive: to change the state of the access key to inactive.

- Step 7: In the Change Key Status confirmation box, click Deactivate to deactivate the selected key. The access key status should change from Active to Inactive. (!) IMPORTANT: Cloud Conformity strongly recommends waiting few days before going forward with the next step in order to ensure that the original (outdated) key is no longer used by your application(s).

- Step 8: Once you are sure that the application(s) is/are no longer using the original key, return to the IAM user configuration page and remove the key by clicking the Delete link: available in the Actions column.

- Step 9: In the Delete Access Key confirmation box, click Delete to remove the selected key.
