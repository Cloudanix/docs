### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Users".

3. In the "User Name" list, choose the name of the desired user, which displays the "Summary" page for that user.

4. In the "Security Credentials" section, under "Access Keys", you can see the date when each access key was last rotated. If the access keys are older than 90 days, it's a misconfiguration as it's a best practice to rotate access keys every 90 days.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all IAM users: The first step to check if User Account Access keys should be rotated in IAM is to list all the IAM users. You can do this by running the following command: `aws iam list-users --query 'Users[*].UserName' --output text`. This command will return a list of all IAM user names.

3. List access keys for each user: For each user, you need to list their access keys to check when they were last rotated. You can do this by running the following command for each user: `aws iam list-access-keys --user-name <username>`. Replace `<username>` with the name of the user. This command will return a list of all access keys for the specified user along with their creation dates.

4. Check the age of each access key: Now, you need to check the age of each access key. If the age of an access key is more than 90 days, it is recommended to rotate it. You can check the age of an access key by comparing the current date with the creation date of the access key. You can do this manually or write a script to automate this process.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the Boto3 library. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials: Before you can interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a file at ~/.aws/credentials. At the very least, the contents of the file should be:

   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Create a Python script: The following Python script uses the Boto3 library to interact with AWS IAM and checks the age of all access keys:

   ```python
   import boto3
   import datetime

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # List all users
   users = iam.list_users()['Users']

   for user in users:
       # List all access keys for a user
       access_keys = iam.list_access_keys(UserName=user['UserName'])['AccessKeyMetadata']
       
       for key in access_keys:
           # Get the age of the access key
           age = (datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc) - key['CreateDate']).days
           print(f"Access key {key['AccessKeyId']} of user {user['UserName']} is {age} days old.")
   ```

4. Run the Python script: You can run the Python script using the Python interpreter:

   ```
   python check_access_key_age.py
   ```

This script will print the age of all access keys for all users. If the age of an access key is more than 90 days, it is recommended to rotate the key.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of user account access keys not being rotated in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your IAM user credentials.
2. Navigate to the IAM service.
3. Click on "Users" from the left-hand menu.
4. Select the user whose access keys need to be rotated.
5. Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
6. Under "Access keys", you will see the list of access keys associated with that user.
7. Click on the "Make inactive" button next to the access key that needs to be rotated.
8. Once the access key is inactive, click on the "Create access key" button.
9. A new access key will be generated. Download the access key file and store it securely.
10. Update the access key in all the applications and scripts where it is used.
11. Once all the applications/scripts have been updated, delete the old access key.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration of user account access keys not being rotated in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of User Account Access keys not being rotated in AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the IAM user(s) whose access keys need to be rotated. You can do this by running the following command:
```
aws iam list-users
```

2. Once you have identified the user(s), create a new access key for them by running the following command:
```
aws iam create-access-key --user-name <IAM-USERNAME>
```
Note: Replace `<IAM-USERNAME>` with the actual IAM username for which you want to create a new access key.

3. After creating the new access key, update the IAM user(s) to use the new access key and disable the old access key by running the following command:
```
aws iam update-access-key --access-key-id <OLD-ACCESS-KEY-ID> --status Inactive --user-name <IAM-USERNAME>
```
Note: Replace `<OLD-ACCESS-KEY-ID>` with the actual access key ID that needs to be disabled and `<IAM-USERNAME>` with the actual IAM username for which you want to disable the old access key.

4. Verify that the new access key is working by running the following command:
```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

5. Once you have verified that the new access key is working, delete the old access key by running the following command:
```
aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id <OLD-ACCESS-KEY-ID> --user-name <IAM-USERNAME>
```
Note: Replace `<OLD-ACCESS-KEY-ID>` with the actual access key ID that needs to be deleted and `<IAM-USERNAME>` with the actual IAM username for which you want to delete the old access key.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of User Account Access keys not being rotated in AWS.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of User Account Access keys should be rotated in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Create a Python script that uses the AWS SDK boto3 to rotate the access keys for IAM users.

2. Install the boto3 package using pip install boto3 command.

3. Use the boto3 client to list all the IAM users in the AWS account using the following code:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('iam')

response = client.list_users()

for user in response['Users']:
    print('IAM user: ' + user['UserName'])
```

4. For each IAM user, use the boto3 client to generate a new access key and then delete the old access key using the following code:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('iam')

response = client.list_access_keys(UserName='IAM_user_name')

for access_key in response['AccessKeyMetadata']:
    print('Deleting access key: ' + access_key['AccessKeyId'])
    client.delete_access_key(UserName='IAM_user_name', AccessKeyId=access_key['AccessKeyId'])

response = client.create_access_key(UserName='IAM_user_name')

print('New access key:\n' + 'AccessKeyId: ' + response['AccessKey']['AccessKeyId'] + '\nSecretAccessKey: ' + response['AccessKey']['SecretAccessKey'])
```

5. Run the Python script to rotate the access keys for all IAM users in the AWS account.

Note: Before running the script, ensure that you have the appropriate IAM permissions to create and delete access keys for IAM users.
