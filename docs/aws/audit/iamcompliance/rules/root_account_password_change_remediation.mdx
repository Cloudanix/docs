### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Users".

3. In the "User Name" list, choose the name of the desired user, which will take you to the "Summary" page for that user.

4. Under "Security Credentials", check the "Password Last Used" field. If it's been a long time since the password was last changed, it indicates that password rotation is not being practiced for the root account.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all IAM users: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the IAM users in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws iam list-users
   ```
   This command will return a list of all IAM users along with their details.

3. Get password last used information: For each user returned in the previous step, run the following command to get the date when the password was last used:

   ```
   aws iam get-login-profile --user-name <username>
   ```
   Replace `<username>` with the name of the IAM user. This command will return the date when the password was last used.

4. Compare the dates: Now, you need to compare the date when the password was last used with the current date. If the difference is more than the maximum allowed password age (for example, 90 days), then the root account does not have password rotation configured properly. You can do this comparison using a Python script or any other programming language of your choice.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. You can do this using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the client: In your Python script, you need to import the Boto3 library and initialize the IAM client. You also need to import the datetime library to calculate the password age.

   ```python
   import boto3
   import datetime

   client = boto3.client('iam')
   ```

3. Fetch the account password policy: You can use the `get_account_password_policy` method to fetch the password policy for the account. This will include information about the password rotation policy.

   ```python
   try:
       response = client.get_account_password_policy()
       max_password_age = response['PasswordPolicy']['MaxPasswordAge']
   except Exception as e:
       print("Error getting account password policy: ", e)
   ```

4. Check the password rotation policy: If the `MaxPasswordAge` is less than or equal to 90, then the root account does not have password rotation enabled. You can print a message to indicate this.

   ```python
   if max_password_age <= 90:
       print("Root account does not have password rotation enabled.")
   else:
       print("Root account has password rotation enabled.")
   ```

Please note that this script assumes that you have configured your AWS credentials in your environment. If not, you need to configure them by calling `boto3.setup_default_session` with your access key, secret access key, and region.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Root Account Should Have Password Rotation" for AWS, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console using your Root Account credentials.
2. Click on your account name in the top right corner and select "My Security Credentials" from the dropdown menu.
3. In the "Security Status" section, you will see a message that says "Password rotation for root account is recommended". Click on the "Rotate now" button next to it.
4. Follow the prompts to create a new password for your Root Account. Make sure to use a strong and unique password, and do not reuse any previous passwords.
5. Once you have created a new password, click on the "Apply password policy now" button to enforce the new password policy for your Root Account.
6. You will receive a confirmation message that your Root Account password has been rotated successfully.

Congratulations, you have now remediated the misconfiguration "Root Account Should Have Password Rotation" for AWS using the AWS console. It is recommended to set up a password rotation policy to ensure that your Root Account password is rotated automatically on a regular basis.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine and run the following command to rotate the root account password:

```
aws iam update-login-profile --user-name <root_account_username> --password <new_password> --password-reset-required
```

Replace `<root_account_username>` with the username of your root account and `<new_password>` with a new, strong password.

2. After running the above command, AWS will prompt you to reset the password the next time you log in to the root account. To do this, log in to your AWS Management Console using your root account credentials and reset the password when prompted.

3. Once you have successfully reset the password, you should create a policy to enforce password rotation for the root account. To do this, create a JSON file with the following content:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowRootPasswordRotation",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:UpdateLoginProfile",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::<account_id>:user/root",
            "Condition": {
                "DateGreaterThan": {
                    "aws:PasswordLastUsed": "90"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Replace `<account_id>` with your AWS account ID.

4. Save the JSON file and run the following command to create a new IAM policy:

```
aws iam create-policy --policy-name <policy_name> --policy-document file://<file_path>
```

Replace `<policy_name>` with a name for your new policy and `<file_path>` with the path to the JSON file you created in step 3.

5. Attach the new policy to the root account by running the following command:

```
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <root_account_username> --policy-arn <policy_arn>
```

Replace `<root_account_username>` with the username of your root account and `<policy_arn>` with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy you created in step 4.

6. Finally, test the policy by waiting for 90 days and then logging in to your AWS Management Console using your root account credentials. AWS will prompt you to reset the password, and you should do so to ensure that your root account password is rotated regularly.

#### Using Python

To remediate the root account password rotation misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install AWS SDK for Python (boto3) using pip:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Create an AWS IAM client:

```
import boto3

iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
```

3. Get the current password policy:

```
response = iam_client.get_account_password_policy()
password_policy = response['PasswordPolicy']
```

4. Check if password rotation is enabled for the root account:

```
if password_policy['MaxPasswordAge'] is None:
    print("Password rotation is not enabled for the root account.")
```

5. If password rotation is not enabled, set a new password policy with password rotation enabled:

```
else:
    new_password_policy = {
        'MinimumPasswordLength': password_policy['MinimumPasswordLength'],
        'RequireSymbols': password_policy['RequireSymbols'],
        'RequireNumbers': password_policy['RequireNumbers'],
        'RequireUppercaseCharacters': password_policy['RequireUppercaseCharacters'],
        'RequireLowercaseCharacters': password_policy['RequireLowercaseCharacters'],
        'AllowUsersToChangePassword': password_policy['AllowUsersToChangePassword'],
        'MaxPasswordAge': 90, # set the maximum password age to 90 days
        'PasswordReusePrevention': password_policy['PasswordReusePrevention']
    }
    
    iam_client.update_account_password_policy(**new_password_policy)
    print("Password rotation is enabled for the root account.")
```

Note: Make sure you have the necessary AWS IAM permissions to update the account password policy.
