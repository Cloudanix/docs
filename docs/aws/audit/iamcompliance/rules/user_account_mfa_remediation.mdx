To remediate the misconfiguration of MFA not being enabled on user accounts in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.

Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.

Step 3: Click on the "Users" tab on the left-hand side of the page.

Step 4: Select the user account that needs MFA enabled.

Step 5: Click on the "Security credentials" tab.

Step 6: Under the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, click on "Manage".

Step 7: Choose "Virtual MFA device" or "U2F security key" and click on "Continue".

Step 8: Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the MFA setup process.

Step 9: Once the MFA is set up, click on "Activate MFA" to enable it for the user account.

Step 10: Repeat steps 4-9 for all user accounts that require MFA to be enabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of MFA not being enabled on user accounts in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of MFA not being enabled on user accounts in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Firstly, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Next, you need to list all the IAM users in your account using the following command:

```
aws iam list-users
```

3. For each user returned in the previous command, you need to check if MFA is enabled or not by running the following command:

```
aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username>
```

4. If MFA is not enabled for a user, you can enable it by running the following command:

```
aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <username> --serial-number <serial-number> --authentication-code-1 <code1> --authentication-code-2 <code2>
```

Here, `<serial-number>` is the unique identifier of the MFA device, and `<code1>` and `<code2>` are the two consecutive authentication codes generated by the MFA device.

5. Once you have enabled MFA for all the IAM users in your account, you can verify the configuration by running the following command:

```
aws iam list-mfa-devices
```

This command will list all the MFA-enabled users in your account along with their MFA device information.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of MFA not being enabled on user accounts in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of MFA not being enabled on user accounts in AWS using Python, you can use the following steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using the following command:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Create an AWS IAM client using the following code:

```python
import boto3

iam = boto3.client('iam')
```

3. List all the IAM users using the following code:

```python
response = iam.list_users()
users = response['Users']
```

4. Loop through each user and check if MFA is enabled. If it is not enabled, enable it using the following code:

```python
for user in users:
    username = user['UserName']
    response = iam.list_mfa_devices(UserName=username)
    mfa_devices = response['MFADevices']
    if not mfa_devices:
        iam.enable_mfa_device(UserName=username, SerialNumber='arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:mfa/'+username, AuthenticationCode1='<code1>', AuthenticationCode2='<code2>')
```

Replace `<account-id>` with your AWS account ID and `<code1>` and `<code2>` with the MFA codes generated by the user's device.

5. Save the Python file and run it using the following command:

```
python <filename>.py
```

This will remediate the misconfiguration of MFA not being enabled on user accounts in AWS.
