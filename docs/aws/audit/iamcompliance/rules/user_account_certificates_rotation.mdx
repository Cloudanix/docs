<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". This will display a list of all the IAM users associated with the account.

3. Click on the user name for which you want to check the certificate rotation. This will open the summary page for the selected user.

4. In the user summary page, navigate to the "Security Credentials" tab. Here, you can see the signing certificates for the user. Check the creation date of the certificate. If the certificate is older than your organization's certificate rotation policy (for example, 90 days), then it is a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by downloading the appropriate installer from the AWS CLI website. Once installed, you can configure it by running `aws configure` and providing your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all IAM users: Use the following command to list all IAM users in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws iam list-users
   ```
   This command will return a list of all IAM users in your AWS account.

3. Get the login profile for each user: For each user returned in the previous step, run the following command to get their login profile:

   ```
   aws iam get-login-profile --user-name <username>
   ```
   Replace `<username>` with the name of the user. This command will return the login profile for the specified user, including the date when the password was last used.

4. Check the password last used date: From the output of the previous command, check the `PasswordLastUsed` field. If this date is more than 90 days ago, the user's password has not been rotated in the last 90 days and is a potential misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS services. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating the files ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config:

   ~/.aws/credentials:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

   ~/.aws/config:
   ```
   [default]
   region=us-east-1
   ```

3. Write a Python script to list all IAM users and their respective access keys:

   ```python
   import boto3
   from datetime import datetime, timezone

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # List users with the pagination interface
   paginator = iam.get_paginator('list_users')
   for response in paginator.paginate():
       for user in response['Users']:
           # List all access keys
           paginator = iam.get_paginator('list_access_keys')
           for response in paginator.paginate(UserName=user['UserName']):
               for key in response['AccessKeyMetadata']:
                   print("User: {0}\nAccess Key: {1}\nStatus: {2}\nCreated On: {3}\n".format(
                       user['UserName'],
                       key['AccessKeyId'],
                       key['Status'],
                       key['CreateDate']
                   ))
   ```

4. Analyze the output: The script will print out the username, access key, status, and creation date of each access key. If the creation date is older than 90 days, the key should be rotated. You can add additional logic to the script to automatically flag keys that are older than 90 days.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "User Account Certificates Should Be Rotated" for AWS using AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM dashboard.
2. Click on the "Users" option from the left-hand side menu.
3. Select the user whose certificate needs to be rotated.
4. Click on the "Security Credentials" tab.
5. Under the "Certificates" section, click on the "Manage" button.
6. Select the certificate that needs to be rotated and click on the "Rotate" button.
7. Follow the on-screen instructions to rotate the certificate.
8. Once the certificate is rotated, delete the old certificate from the user's account.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "User Account Certificates Should Be Rotated" for AWS using AWS console.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of user account certificates that should be rotated in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the steps below:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.
2. Run the following command to list all the IAM users in your AWS account:

```
aws iam list-users
```

3. Identify the user whose certificate needs to be rotated.
4. Run the following command to generate a new certificate for the user:

```
aws iam upload-signing-certificate --user-name <user-name> --certificate-body file://<certificate-file>
```

Replace `<user-name>` with the name of the user whose certificate needs to be rotated and `<certificate-file>` with the file path of the new certificate.

5. Run the following command to delete the old certificate:

```
aws iam delete-signing-certificate --user-name <user-name> --certificate-id <certificate-id>
```

Replace `<user-name>` with the name of the user whose certificate needs to be rotated and `<certificate-id>` with the ID of the old certificate.

6. Verify that the old certificate has been deleted by running the following command:

```
aws iam list-signing-certificates --user-name <user-name>
```

7. Verify that the new certificate has been uploaded by running the following command:

```
aws iam list-signing-certificates --user-name <user-name>
```

8. Repeat steps 4-7 for all the users whose certificates need to be rotated.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration of user account certificates that should be rotated in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to rotate user account certificates. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. Install Boto3: If you don't have Boto3 installed, you can install it using pip. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Configure AWS credentials: You need to configure AWS credentials to use Boto3. You can do this by setting the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables or by creating a credentials file in the ~/.aws directory.

3. List user account certificates: Use the `list_signing_certificates` method of the IAM client to list the signing certificates for a user. You can pass the username as a parameter. Here's an example:

```python
import boto3

iam = boto3.client('iam')

response = iam.list_signing_certificates(UserName='example_user')

certificates = response['Certificates']

for certificate in certificates:
    print(certificate['CertificateId'])
```

4. Delete user account certificates: Use the `delete_signing_certificate` method of the IAM client to delete a signing certificate for a user. You can pass the certificate ID as a parameter. Here's an example:

```python
import boto3

iam = boto3.client('iam')

response = iam.list_signing_certificates(UserName='example_user')

certificates = response['Certificates']

for certificate in certificates:
    iam.delete_signing_certificate(UserName='example_user', CertificateId=certificate['CertificateId'])
```

5. Create new user account certificates: Use the `upload_signing_certificate` method of the IAM client to create a new signing certificate for a user. You can pass the certificate body as a parameter. Here's an example:

```python
import boto3

iam = boto3.client('iam')

certificate_body = '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----'

response = iam.upload_signing_certificate(UserName='example_user', CertificateBody=certificate_body)

certificate_id = response['Certificate']['CertificateId']

print(certificate_id)
```

6. Schedule certificate rotation: You can schedule certificate rotation using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) or a third-party tool. For example, you can use AWS Lambda to rotate certificates on a regular schedule.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of user account certificates not being rotated in AWS.
