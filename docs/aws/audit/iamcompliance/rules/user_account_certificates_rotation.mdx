How to rotate user account certificates?

#### Using AWS Console

To rotate user account certificates in AWS, you can follow these steps:

1. Generate a New User Certificate: Generate a new X.509 certificate for the user account using a trusted certificate authority (CA) or AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). The specific process may vary depending on your certificate provider or ACM configuration.

2. Update User Account Configuration: Update the user account configuration to associate the new certificate with the user. This can be done using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. For example, if you are using the AWS CLI, you can run the following command:
```
aws iam upload-signing-certificate --user-name <username> --certificate-body file://path/to/new_certificate.pem
```
Replace `<username>` with the actual username and provide the path to the new certificate file.

3. Remove Old User Certificate: Once the new certificate is associated with the user, you can remove or deactivate the old certificate. This step ensures that only the new certificate is used for authentication. Again, this can be done through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. For example, to remove an old certificate using the AWS CLI, you can run the following command:
```
aws iam delete-signing-certificate --user-name <username> --certificate-id <certificate-id>
```
Replace `<username>` with the actual username and `<certificate-id>` with the ID of the old certificate.

4. Test User Account Access: After rotating the user certificate, test the user account access to ensure that the new certificate is working properly. You can try accessing AWS services or resources using the updated user credentials.

By following these steps, you can rotate user account certificates in AWS and ensure secure access to your AWS resources. It's important to regularly rotate certificates to maintain strong security practices.
