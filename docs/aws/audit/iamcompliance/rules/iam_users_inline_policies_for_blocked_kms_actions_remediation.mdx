### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard by selecting "Services" and then "IAM" under the "Security, Identity, & Compliance" section.
3. In the IAM dashboard, select "Policies" from the left-hand navigation menu.
4. Here, you can see all the policies. For each policy, click on the policy name to open it. In the policy details page, check the "Policy Document". If the "Effect" is "Deny" and "Action" is "kms:*", it means that all KMS actions are blocked in that inline policy. Repeat this process for all policies to detect any misconfigurations.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute IAM related commands.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the IAM policies using the following command:
   ```
   aws iam list-policies --scope Local
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the IAM policies in your AWS account.

3. For each policy, you can get the policy details including the policy document by using the following command:
   ```
   aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <Policy_ARN> --version-id <Policy_Version_ID>
   ```
   Replace `<Policy_ARN>` with the ARN of the policy and `<Policy_Version_ID>` with the version ID of the policy. This command will return the policy document which includes the permissions set by the policy.

4. Now, you need to check the policy document for any blocked KMS actions. You can do this by looking for "kms:Deny" statements in the policy document. If you find any such statements, it means that some KMS actions are blocked in the inline policy.

#### Using Python

1. First, you need to import the necessary libraries in your Python script. You will need the boto3 library, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc.

```python
import boto3
```

2. Next, create a session using your AWS credentials. You can also use the AWS CLI's default session if your script is running on a machine that's configured with AWS CLI.

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    aws_session_token='SESSION_TOKEN',
)
```

3. Now, create an IAM resource from that session and get all IAM policies.

```python
iam_resource = session.resource('iam')
policies = iam_resource.policies.all()
```

4. Iterate over all policies and check if any policy has blocked KMS actions. If a policy has blocked KMS actions, print the policy name.

```python
for policy in policies:
    policy_document = policy.default_version.document
    for statement in policy_document['Statement']:
        if 'kms:Decrypt' in statement['Action'] and statement['Effect'] == 'Deny':
            print(f"Policy {policy.policy_name} has blocked KMS actions")
```

This script will print the names of all policies that have blocked KMS actions. You can modify this script according to your needs. For example, you can check for other blocked actions, not just 'kms:Decrypt'.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**:
   - Navigate to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and sign in with your AWS account credentials.

2. **Access the IAM service**:
   - In the AWS Management Console, search for "IAM" in the services search bar and click on the "IAM" service to access the IAM dashboard.

3. **Identify the user/group/role with inline policy**:
   - Identify the user, group, or role that has an inline policy with blocked KMS actions. You can do this by navigating to the respective User, Group, or Role within the IAM dashboard.

4. **Edit the inline policy**:
   - Select the user, group, or role that has the inline policy with blocked KMS actions.
   - Under the "Permissions" tab, locate the inline policy that contains the blocked KMS actions.
   - Click on the inline policy to edit it.

5. **Update the inline policy**:
   - Within the inline policy editor, locate the section where KMS actions are defined.
   - Remove any explicit deny statements that block KMS actions. Ensure that the necessary KMS actions are allowed as per your organization's policies.

6. **Save the changes**:
   - After updating the inline policy to allow the required KMS actions, review the changes to ensure they are correct.
   - Click on the "Save changes" or "Update policy" button to save the modified inline policy.

7. **Verify the changes**:
   - Once the inline policy is updated, verify that the blocked KMS actions have been remediated.
   - You can test the permissions by attempting to perform the KMS actions that were previously blocked.

8. **Monitor for compliance**:
   - Regularly monitor your IAM policies and permissions to ensure that they comply with your organization's security and compliance requirements.
   - Consider implementing AWS Config rules or AWS CloudTrail logs to track and alert on any future misconfigurations related to KMS actions.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies within AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the IAM user or role with the inline policy containing blocked KMS actions.
  
Step 2: Use the AWS CLI to view the inline policy attached to the IAM user or role. Replace `IAM-ENTITY-NAME` with the actual IAM user or role name.

```bash
aws iam list-user-policies --user-name IAM-ENTITY-NAME
```

or

```bash
aws iam list-role-policies --role-name IAM-ENTITY-NAME
```

Step 3: Get the policy document for the inline policy. Replace `IAM-ENTITY-NAME` with the actual IAM user or role name and `POLICY-NAME` with the policy name.

```bash
aws iam get-user-policy --user-name IAM-ENTITY-NAME --policy-name POLICY-NAME
```

or

```bash
aws iam get-role-policy --role-name IAM-ENTITY-NAME --policy-name POLICY-NAME
```

Step 4: Review the policy document to identify the blocked KMS actions.

Step 5: Modify the policy document to allow the required KMS actions. You can create a new policy or update the existing policy based on your requirements.

Step 6: Update the inline policy for the IAM user or role with the modified policy document. Replace `IAM-ENTITY-NAME`, `POLICY-NAME`, and `POLICY-DOCUMENT` with the actual values.

```bash
aws iam put-user-policy --user-name IAM-ENTITY-NAME --policy-name POLICY-NAME --policy-document file://POLICY-DOCUMENT.json
```

or

```bash
aws iam put-role-policy --role-name IAM-ENTITY-NAME --policy-name POLICY-NAME --policy-document file://POLICY-DOCUMENT.json
```

Step 7: Verify that the inline policy has been updated successfully by checking the policy document.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of blocked KMS actions in inline policies in AWS IAM using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of blocked KMS actions in inline policies for AWS IAM using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the IAM user or role with the inline policy that contains blocked KMS actions.
2. Update the inline policy to allow the necessary KMS actions.
3. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to programmatically update the inline policy.

Here is a sample Python script to remediate this issue:

```python
import boto3

iam = boto3.client('iam')

# IAM user or role name with the inline policy containing blocked KMS actions
entity_name = 'YOUR_IAM_ENTITY_NAME'
policy_name = 'YOUR_POLICY_NAME'

# Define the necessary KMS actions to be allowed in the policy
kms_actions = [
    "kms:Encrypt",
    "kms:Decrypt",
    # Add more KMS actions as needed
]

# Get the current policy document
response = iam.get_user_policy(UserName=entity_name, PolicyName=policy_name)
policy_document = response['PolicyDocument']

# Update the policy document to allow the KMS actions
for statement in policy_document['Statement']:
    if 'Resource' in statement and statement['Resource'].startswith('arn:aws:kms'):
        if 'Effect' in statement and statement['Effect'] == 'Deny':
            statement['Effect'] = 'Allow'
            statement['Action'] = kms_actions

# Update the policy with the modified document
iam.put_user_policy(UserName=entity_name, PolicyName=policy_name, PolicyDocument=policy_document)

print(f"Updated inline policy {policy_name} for {entity_name} to allow KMS actions: {kms_actions}")
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_IAM_ENTITY_NAME` and `YOUR_POLICY_NAME` with the appropriate values for your IAM user or role and policy name.

After running this script, the inline policy for the specified IAM user or role should be updated to allow the necessary KMS actions, remedying the misconfiguration.
