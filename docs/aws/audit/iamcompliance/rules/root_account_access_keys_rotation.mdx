How to rotate root account access keys.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using your root account credentials.
2. In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the "My Security Credentials" page. You can access it by clicking on your account name in the top-right corner and selecting the "My Security Credentials" option from the dropdown menu.
3. In the "Access keys (access key ID and secret access key)" section, you will see the access key associated with your root account. Take note of the access key ID.
4. Click on the "Create access key" button to generate a new access key for your root account. This will automatically disable the previous access key.
5. After the new access key is generated, you will see the access key ID and secret access key on the screen. Make sure to copy the secret access key as it will not be displayed again.
6. Update your applications or scripts that use the root account access keys with the new access key ID and secret access key.
7. Test the new access key to ensure it is working correctly. You can do this by performing a basic API call or using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) with the updated credentials.
8. Once you have confirmed that the new access key is working properly, you can securely delete the old access key. Click on the "X" button next to the old access key in the "Access keys (access key ID and secret access key)" section to delete it.
9. After completing the key rotation process, make sure to securely store the new access key ID and secret access key. It is recommended to use a secure password manager or key management solution for storing and managing your access keys.
