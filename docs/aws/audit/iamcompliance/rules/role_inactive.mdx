<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the "Inactive Roles Should Be Removed" misconfiguration in AWS:

1. Login to your AWS console.
2. Navigate to the "Identity and Access Management (IAM)" service.
3. Click on "Roles" from the left-hand menu.
4. Review the list of roles and identify any inactive roles.
5. Select the inactive role by clicking on the role name.
6. Click on the "Delete Role" button.
7. Confirm the deletion by clicking on "Yes, delete" button.

Note: Before deleting any role, make sure that the role is not being used by any resources or services in your AWS account. If a role is being used, then removing it can cause disruption to the resources or services.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Inactive Roles Should Be Removed" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your computer.

2. Run the following command to list all the roles in your AWS account:

```
aws iam list-roles
```

3. Identify the inactive roles that have not been used for a long time. You can check the "LastUsedDate" attribute of each role to determine when it was last used.

4. Run the following command to delete the inactive roles:

```
aws iam delete-role --role-name <role-name>
```

Replace `<role-name>` with the name of the inactive role that you want to delete.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all the inactive roles that you want to remove.

Note: Before deleting any role, make sure that it is not being used by any resources or applications in your AWS account. Deleting a role that is still in use can cause issues with your applications and services.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of inactive roles in AWS, you can use the following steps using Python:

1. First, you need to list all the roles in your AWS account using the `boto3` library in Python. You can use the following code to achieve this:

```python
import boto3

# Create an IAM client
iam = boto3.client('iam')

# List roles
response = iam.list_roles()
roles = response['Roles']
```

2. Once you have the list of roles, you need to check if any of the roles are inactive. You can do this by checking the `CreateDate` attribute of the role. If the role was created more than a certain number of days ago (e.g. 90 days), you can consider it inactive. You can use the following code to achieve this:

```python
import datetime

# Define the number of days after which a role is considered inactive
inactive_days = 90

# Check if any roles are inactive
for role in roles:
    create_date = role['CreateDate'].replace(tzinfo=None)
    if (datetime.datetime.now() - create_date).days > inactive_days:
        print(f"Role {role['RoleName']} is inactive and should be removed.")
```

3. Finally, to remove the inactive roles, you can use the `delete_role` method of the `boto3` library. You can use the following code to achieve this:

```python
# Delete inactive roles
for role in roles:
    create_date = role['CreateDate'].replace(tzinfo=None)
    if (datetime.datetime.now() - create_date).days > inactive_days:
        iam.delete_role(RoleName=role['RoleName'])
        print(f"Role {role['RoleName']} has been deleted.")
```

Note: Before running the above code, make sure you have the necessary IAM permissions to delete roles.
