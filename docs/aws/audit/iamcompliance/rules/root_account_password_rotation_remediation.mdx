To remediate the issue of Root Account Password not being rotated in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/) and sign in using your root account credentials.

2. **Navigate to the IAM Dashboard**: Once you are logged in, navigate to the IAM service by searching for it in the AWS Management Console search bar or by clicking on the "Services" dropdown menu and selecting "IAM" under the "Security, Identity, & Compliance" section.

3. **Select the Root User**: In the IAM dashboard, click on the "Users" tab on the left-hand side. Locate and click on the root user in the list of IAM users displayed.

4. **Rotate the Root Account Password**: In the root user details page, scroll down to the "Security credentials" section. Click on the "Manage" button next to "Console password". 

5. **Change the Root Account Password**: Click on the "Enable" button to enable the password reset. Enter a new password that meets the AWS password policy requirements (e.g., minimum length, complexity). 

6. **Save the New Password**: Click on the "Apply" button to save the new password for the root account.

7. **Update Root Account Password Regularly**: It is recommended to set up a schedule to regularly rotate the root account password to enhance security.

8. **Review and Confirm**: After changing the root account password, review the changes to ensure that the password has been successfully rotated.

By following these steps, you have successfully rotated the Root Account Password in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, thereby remediating the misconfiguration of not rotating the root account password.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of not rotating the root account password in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

```bash
aws iam change-password --old-password <old-password> --new-password <new-password>
```

Replace `<old-password>` with the current root account password and `<new-password>` with the new password. Ensure that the password change meets the specified `minimumPasswordRotationDays`.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of the root account password not being rotated in AWS IAM using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Create a Python script with the following code to rotate the root account password:

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def remind_root_account_password_rotation(minimum_rotation_days):
    # Check when the root account password was last changed
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
    response = iam_client.get_account_password_policy()
    max_password_age = response['PasswordPolicy']['MaxPasswordAge']

    root_user = iam_client.get_user(UserName='root')
    create_date = root_user['User']['CreateDate']
    password_last_changed = root_user['User'].get('PasswordLastUsed')

    if password_last_changed is None:
        print("Root account password has not been used yet.")
        return

    days_since_rotation = (datetime.now() - password_last_changed.replace(tzinfo=None)).days

    if days_since_rotation >= minimum_rotation_days:
        print("Root account password has not been rotated within the specified timeframe.")
    else:
        print("Root account password rotation is up to date.")

def main():
    # Specify the minimum password rotation days
    minimum_rotation_days = 90  # Example: Minimum rotation period of 90 days

    # Remind users to rotate the root account password
    remind_root_account_password_rotation(minimum_rotation_days)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script checks when the root account password was last changed and reminds users to rotate the password if it hasn't been rotated within the specified `minimumPasswordRotationDays`. Adjust the `minimum_rotation_days` variable as needed.
