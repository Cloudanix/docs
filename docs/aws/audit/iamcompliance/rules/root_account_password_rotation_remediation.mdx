1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
3. In the "User Name" list, choose the name of the intended user. This opens the summary page for the user.
4. In the "Security Credential" section, check the "Password Last Used" field. If the password has not been used for a long period of time, it indicates that the root account password has not been rotated.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all IAM users: Once AWS CLI is set up, you can list all IAM users in your AWS account by running the following command:
   ```
   aws iam list-users
   ```
   This command will return a list of all IAM users along with their metadata.

3. Get IAM user's password last used date: For each IAM user, you can get the date when the user's password was last used by running the following command:
   ```
   aws iam get-user --user-name <username>
   ```
   Replace `<username>` with the name of the IAM user. This command will return the user's metadata including the `PasswordLastUsed` field.

4. Check password last used date: Now, you can check the `PasswordLastUsed` field for each user. If this date is more than 90 days ago, it means the root account password has not been rotated in the last 90 days and this is a misconfiguration.

1. First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3` in your terminal.

2. Once Boto3 is installed, you can use it to interact with AWS services. To check the root account password, you need to interact with the IAM service. Here is a sample script:

```python
import boto3

# Create IAM client
iam = boto3.client('iam')

# Get account password policy
try:
    response = iam.get_account_password_policy()
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print("No password policy found.")
```

3. This script will print out the account password policy. If there is no password policy, it will print "No password policy found." 

4. To check if the root account password should be rotated, you need to look at the 'ExpirePasswords' field in the response. If it is set to 'True', then passwords are set to expire and should be rotated. If it is 'False', then passwords do not expire and do not need to be rotated. You can add this check to the script like this:

```python
import boto3

# Create IAM client
iam = boto3.client('iam')

# Get account password policy
try:
    response = iam.get_account_password_policy()
    if response['PasswordPolicy']['ExpirePasswords']:
        print("Passwords are set to expire. Root account password should be rotated.")
    else:
        print("Passwords are not set to expire. Root account password does not need to be rotated.")
except Exception as e:
    print("No password policy found.")
```

This script will now tell you whether the root account password should be rotated based on the account password policy.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the issue of Root Account Password not being rotated in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/) and sign in using your root account credentials.

2. **Navigate to the IAM Dashboard**: Once you are logged in, navigate to the IAM service by searching for it in the AWS Management Console search bar or by clicking on the "Services" dropdown menu and selecting "IAM" under the "Security, Identity, & Compliance" section.

3. **Select the Root User**: In the IAM dashboard, click on the "Users" tab on the left-hand side. Locate and click on the root user in the list of IAM users displayed.

4. **Rotate the Root Account Password**: In the root user details page, scroll down to the "Security credentials" section. Click on the "Manage" button next to "Console password". 

5. **Change the Root Account Password**: Click on the "Enable" button to enable the password reset. Enter a new password that meets the AWS password policy requirements (e.g., minimum length, complexity). 

6. **Save the New Password**: Click on the "Apply" button to save the new password for the root account.

7. **Update Root Account Password Regularly**: It is recommended to set up a schedule to regularly rotate the root account password to enhance security.

8. **Review and Confirm**: After changing the root account password, review the changes to ensure that the password has been successfully rotated.

By following these steps, you have successfully rotated the Root Account Password in AWS IAM using the AWS Management Console, thereby remediating the misconfiguration of not rotating the root account password.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of not rotating the root account password in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following AWS CLI command to rotate the root account password:
```
aws iam change-password --user-name <root_account_username>
```
Replace `<root_account_username>` with the username of your AWS root account.

3. AWS CLI will prompt you to enter the current password for the root account. Enter the current password and press Enter.

4. Next, AWS CLI will ask you to enter a new password for the root account. Enter a strong and secure password that meets the AWS password policy requirements and press Enter.

5. Confirm the new password by entering it again when prompted.

6. Once the password is successfully changed, you will receive a confirmation message.

By following these steps, you have successfully rotated the root account password for your AWS IAM user using AWS CLI. Remember to store the new password securely and update it in your password manager or secure storage.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of the root account password not being rotated in AWS IAM using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Create a Python script with the following code to rotate the root account password:

```python
import boto3

def rotate_root_account_password():
    # Initialize the IAM client
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
    
    # Generate a new random password
    new_password = 'your_new_password_here'
    
    # Change the root account password
    iam_client.change_password(
        OldPassword='your_current_root_password_here',
        NewPassword=new_password
    )
    
    print("Root account password rotated successfully.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    rotate_root_account_password()
```

3. Replace `'your_new_password_here'` with a new secure password and `'your_current_root_password_here'` with the current root account password.

4. Run the Python script to rotate the root account password. This will change the root account password to the new password specified in the script.

5. Make sure to securely store the new root account password and update any necessary documentation or password management tools.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of the root account password not being rotated in AWS IAM using Python.
