### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". This will display a list of all IAM users created for your AWS account.

3. Click on the username that you want to check. This will open the user's summary page.

4. In the "Security credentials" tab, check the "Access keys" section. Here, you can see the status of each access key (Active or Inactive) and the date when it was last used. If an access key is inactive and hasn't been used for a long time, it's a potential misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all IAM users: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the IAM users in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws iam list-users
   ```

   This command will return a list of all IAM users along with their metadata.

3. List access keys for each user: For each user returned in the previous step, use the following AWS CLI command to list all the access keys associated with that user:

   ```
   aws iam list-access-keys --user-name <username>
   ```

   Replace `<username>` with the name of the user. This command will return a list of all access keys associated with the specified user along with their metadata.

4. Check the status of each access key: For each access key returned in the previous step, check the 'Status' field. If the status is 'Inactive', then the access key is not being used and should be dropped.

#### Using Python

1. Import the necessary libraries: You will need the boto3 library, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc.

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Create an IAM client: You will need to create an IAM client using your AWS credentials.

```python
try:
    # Create IAM client
    iam = boto3.client('iam')
except ClientError as e:
    print(f"Error creating IAM client: {e}")
```

3. List all access keys: You can list all the access keys associated with your account using the list_access_keys() method.

```python
try:
    # List all access keys
    response = iam.list_access_keys(UserName='IAM_USER_NAME')
except ClientError as e:
    print(f"Error retrieving access keys: {e}")
```

4. Check the status of each access key: You can check the status of each access key by iterating over the response from the previous step. If the status of an access key is 'Inactive', print a message indicating that the key should be dropped.

```python
for key in response['AccessKeyMetadata']:
    if key['Status'] == 'Inactive':
        print(f"Inactive access key for user {key['UserName']} should be dropped.")
```

Remember to replace 'IAM_USER_NAME' with the actual IAM user name. This script will only check for inactive access keys for the specified IAM user. If you want to check for all users, you would need to first retrieve a list of all IAM users and then check the access keys for each user.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of inactive user account access keys in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS console:

1. Login to the AWS management console using your credentials.

2. Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) dashboard.

3. Click on the "Users" option from the left-hand side menu.

4. Select the user account for which you want to drop the inactive access keys.

5. Click on the "Security Credentials" tab.

6. Under the "Access keys" section, you will see the list of active and inactive access keys associated with the user account.

7. Identify the inactive access keys that you want to drop.

8. Click on the "Make Inactive" button next to the access key that you want to drop.

9. A confirmation message will appear, click on "Yes, Make Inactive" to confirm.

10. The inactive access key will now be dropped, and you can repeat the same process to drop any other inactive access keys associated with the user account.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of inactive user account access keys in AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the IAM users in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws iam list-users
   ```

3. Identify the inactive users from the list. Inactive users are those who have not used their access keys for a long time.

4. Run the following command to list the access keys for an inactive user:

   ```
   aws iam list-access-keys --user-name <user-name>
   ```

   Replace `<user-name>` with the name of the inactive user.

5. Identify the inactive access keys from the list. Inactive access keys are those that have not been used for a long time.

6. Run the following command to delete the inactive access keys:

   ```
   aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id <access-key-id> --user-name <user-name>
   ```

   Replace `<access-key-id>` with the ID of the inactive access key and `<user-name>` with the name of the inactive user.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 for all the inactive users and access keys in your AWS account.

8. Once you have deleted all the inactive access keys, verify that the misconfiguration has been remediated by running a security audit of your AWS account.

Note: Before deleting any access keys, make sure that they are really inactive and not being used by any application or service. Deleting active access keys can result in service disruption.

#### Using Python

To remediate the inactive user account access keys issue in AWS, you can use the following Python script:

1. First, you need to import the necessary modules:

```python
import boto3
import datetime
```

2. Next, you need to create an AWS IAM client:

```python
client = boto3.client('iam')
```

3. Then, you can get a list of all IAM users:

```python
users = client.list_users()['Users']
```

4. For each user, you can get a list of their access keys:

```python
for user in users:
    access_keys = client.list_access_keys(UserName=user['UserName'])['AccessKeyMetadata']
```

5. You can then check the last time each access key was used:

```python
for key in access_keys:
    last_used = client.get_access_key_last_used(AccessKeyId=key['AccessKeyId'])
    if 'LastUsedDate' not in last_used['AccessKeyLastUsed']:
        # Access key has never been used
        client.delete_access_key(UserName=user['UserName'], AccessKeyId=key['AccessKeyId'])
    else:
        last_used_date = last_used['AccessKeyLastUsed']['LastUsedDate']
        days_since_last_used = (datetime.datetime.now() - last_used_date.replace(tzinfo=None)).days
        if days_since_last_used > 90:
            # Access key has not been used in over 90 days
            client.delete_access_key(UserName=user['UserName'], AccessKeyId=key['AccessKeyId'])
```

6. Finally, you can delete any access keys that have not been used in over 90 days or that have never been used.

```python
client.delete_access_key(UserName=user['UserName'], AccessKeyId=key['AccessKeyId'])
```

Note: Before running this script, make sure you have the necessary permissions to manage IAM users and access keys.
