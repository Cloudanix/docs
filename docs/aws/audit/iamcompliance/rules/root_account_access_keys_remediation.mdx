### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Root Account Should Not Have Access Keys" misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your root account credentials.
2. Go to the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console.
3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Users".
4. Click on the root user account.
5. In the "Security credentials" tab, locate the "Access keys" section.
6. Delete any access keys that are listed.
7. Click on the "Delete" button to confirm the deletion of the access keys.
8. Once the access keys are deleted, ensure that the root user account has MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) enabled for additional security.

Note: It is recommended to create a new IAM user with administrative privileges and use that account instead of the root account for day-to-day tasks to reduce the risk of accidental misconfigurations or security breaches.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Root Account Should Not Have Access Keys" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console with root account credentials.
2. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.
3. Run the following command to delete the access keys associated with the root account:
```
aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id <access-key-id> --user-name <user-name>
```
Note: Replace `<access-key-id>` with the access key ID associated with the root account and `<user-name>` with the name of the root user.
4. Confirm the deletion by typing "y" when prompted.

After running this command, the access keys associated with the root account will be deleted, and the misconfiguration "Root Account Should Not Have Access Keys" will be remediated. It is recommended to use IAM users with limited permissions and not use the root account for day-to-day operations to minimize the risk of security breaches.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of root account having access keys in AWS using Python, follow the below steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using the command `pip install boto3`.
2. Create an AWS session using the access key and secret key of a user account that has sufficient permissions to modify the root account.
3. Use the `iam` resource of Boto3 to get the root user object.
4. Use the `access_keys` attribute of the root user object to get all the access keys associated with the root account.
5. Use a for loop to iterate over all the access keys and delete them one by one using the `delete()` method of the access key object.

Here is the Python code to remediate the misconfiguration of root account having access keys:

```python
import boto3

# Create an AWS session
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='SECRET_KEY'
)

# Get the root user object
iam = session.resource('iam')
root_user = iam.User('root')

# Get all the access keys associated with root account
access_keys = root_user.access_keys.all()

# Delete all the access keys
for access_key in access_keys:
    access_key.delete()
```

Note: Make sure to replace the `ACCESS_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` with the access key and secret key of the user account that has sufficient permissions to modify the root account.
