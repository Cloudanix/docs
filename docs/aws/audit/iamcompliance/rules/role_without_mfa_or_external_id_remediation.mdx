### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as a root user or an IAM user.
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Users". Here you will see a list of all IAM users for your AWS account.
3. Choose the name of the intended user. This will open the summary page for the user.
4. In the "Security credentials" section, under "Assigned MFA device", you can check if the root account has MFA enabled or not. If there is no assigned MFA device, it means MFA is not enabled for this user.
5. To check if the External ID is set, navigate to the "Trust relationships" tab in the user's summary page. Here you can see the policy document. If the "sts:ExternalId" condition is included in the policy, it means the External ID is set. If not, the External ID is not set for this user.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Once you have AWS CLI installed and configured, you can proceed to the next steps.

2. To check if the root account has MFA enabled, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws iam get-account-summary
   ```
   This command will return a JSON object that contains information about your AWS account. Look for the "AccountMFAEnabled" field in the output. If the value of this field is 1, then MFA is enabled for the root account. If the value is 0, then MFA is not enabled.

3. To check if the root account has an external ID set, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws iam list-roles
   ```
   This command will return a list of all IAM roles in your AWS account. For each role, look for the "AssumeRolePolicyDocument" field in the output. This field contains a policy document that specifies who can assume the role. If the policy document includes a "sts:ExternalId" condition, then the role has an external ID set.

4. If you want to automate these checks, you can write a Python script that uses the Boto3 library to interact with the AWS CLI. The script would call the `get_account_summary` and `list_roles` methods and parse the output to check for MFA and external ID.

#### Using Python

1. AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) can be used to interact with AWS services including IAM. First, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Once Boto3 is installed and configured, you can use the following script to check if the root account has MFA enabled:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('iam')
response = client.get_account_summary()

if response['SummaryMap']['AccountMFAEnabled'] == 1:
    print("MFA is enabled for the root account")
else:
    print("MFA is not enabled for the root account")
```

3. To check if the root account has an external ID set, you can use the following script:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('iam')
response = client.list_roles()

for role in response['Roles']:
    if 'ExternalId' in role['AssumeRolePolicyDocument']:
        print(f"Role {role['RoleName']} has an external ID set")
    else:
        print(f"Role {role['RoleName']} does not have an external ID set")
```

4. Please note that these scripts assume that you have the necessary permissions to call these IAM APIs. If you don't, you'll need to adjust your IAM policies accordingly. Also, these scripts will only check the root account. If you have other IAM users, you'll need to adjust the scripts to check those users as well.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration in AWS IAM where the root account should have MFA and External ID set, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the Root Account**:
    - Log in to the AWS Management Console using the root account credentials.
    - Navigate to the IAM service.
    - In the navigation pane, click on "Users".
    - Click on the root account username.
    - In the "Security credentials" tab, locate the "Assigned MFA device" section and click on "Manage".
    - Follow the prompts to set up MFA for the root account. You can choose to use a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA device.
    - Once MFA is enabled, make sure to complete the MFA setup process.

2. **Set an External ID for the Root Account**:
    - While still in the IAM Management Console, click on the root account username.
    - In the "Permissions" tab, click on the "Add inline policy" button.
    - Select the JSON tab to provide a custom policy.
    - Enter a policy document similar to the following, replacing `YOUR_EXTERNAL_ID` with your desired external ID:
    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "*",
                "Resource": "*",
                "Condition": {
                    "StringEquals": {
                        "sts:ExternalId": "YOUR_EXTERNAL_ID"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    - Click on Review policy, provide a name for the policy, and click on "Create policy".

3. **Test the External ID**:
    - To test the External ID, you can try to assume a role that requires the External ID. If the External ID is set correctly, the assumption of the role should succeed.

By following these steps, you will have successfully remediated the misconfiguration in AWS IAM where the root account should have MFA and an External ID set.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of the root account not having MFA and External ID set in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Enable MFA for Root Account**:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to enable MFA for the root account:
     ```
     aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <root_account_username> --serial-number arn:aws:iam::<account_id>:mfa/root-account-mfa
     ```
     Replace `<root_account_username>` with the root account's username and `<account_id>` with your AWS account ID.

2. **Set External ID for Root Account**:
   - Generate a random external ID using a tool like `openssl`:
     ```
     openssl rand -hex 32
     ```
   - Copy the generated External ID.

3. **Attach the Policy to the Root Account**:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to attach the `IAMFullAccess` policy to the root account with the External ID:
     ```
     aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <root_account_username> --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMFullAccess --policy-inputs '{"ExternalId":"<generated_external_id>"}'
     ```
     Replace `<root_account_username>` with the root account's username and `<generated_external_id>` with the External ID you generated in step 2.

4. **Verify Configuration**:
   - To verify that MFA and External ID are set for the root account, run the following AWS CLI commands:
     - Check MFA status:
       ```
       aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <root_account_username>
       ```
     - Check attached policies with External ID:
       ```
       aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name <root_account_username>
       ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of the root account not having MFA and External ID set in AWS IAM using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration in AWS IAM where the root account should have MFA and External ID set, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to automate the process. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this issue:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   If you haven't installed Boto3 yet, you can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create a Python script**:
   Create a Python script (e.g., `remediate_root_account_mfa.py`) and import the necessary libraries:
   ```python
   import boto3
   ```

3. **Enable MFA for the root account**:
   You can use the following code snippet to enable MFA for the root account:
   ```python
   iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
   iam_client.enable_mfa_device(UserName='root', SerialNumber='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMUser')
   ```

4. **Set External ID for the root account**:
   You can use the following code snippet to set an External ID for the root account:
   ```python
   account_id = boto3.client('sts').get_caller_identity().get('Account')
   external_id = 'your_external_id_here'

   iam_client.create_account_alias(AccountAlias=external_id)
   ```

5. **Run the Python script**:
   Execute the Python script using the command:
   ```
   python remediate_root_account_mfa.py
   ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration in AWS IAM where the root account should have MFA and External ID set using Python and Boto3.
