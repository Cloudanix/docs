### Remediation

How to remove privileges to a service if it is unused by an IAM role.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using an account with administrative privileges.
2. Open the IAM console by navigating to the IAM service.
3. In the navigation pane, click on "Roles" to view the list of IAM roles in your account.
4. Identify the IAM role for which you want to remove privileges to a specific service if it is unused.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Role Service Inactivity" Policy.)
5. Select the checkbox next to the IAM role's name to activate the actions menu.
6. Click on the "Permissions" tab in the role details view.
7. Review the policies attached to the IAM role and identify the policy granting privileges to the unused service.
8. Click on the policy name to view the policy details.
9. In the policy details view, review the permissions granted to the unused service.
10. If you determine that the IAM role no longer requires access to the service, you can remove the policy.
11. To remove the policy, click on the "Detach policy" button.
12. You will be prompted to confirm the detachment. Click on "Detach" to proceed.
13. The policy will be detached from the IAM role, and the role will no longer have privileges for the unused service.
14. Repeat the process for any other policies granting access to unused services for the IAM role.
