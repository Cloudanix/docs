How to ensure that your AWS S3 buckets content cannot be listed by AWS authenticated accounts or IAM users?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: Select the S3 bucket that you want to examine and click the Properties tab from the dashboard top-right menu:
- Step 2: In the Properties panel, click Permissions to expand the bucket Access Control List (ACL) configuration tab and search for the grantee (predefined group) named "Any Authenticated AWS User".

- Step 3: Uncheck the List (READ) permission applied to "Any Authenticated AWS User":
  or delete the predefined group using the x button next to the group settings:
- Step 4: Click Save to apply the new ACL configuration and remove the bucket READ (LIST) access for AWS authenticated users.
