How to ensure that your Amazon S3 buckets can't be accessed for WRITE actions by anonymous users?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: Select the S3 bucket.

- Step 2: Click on the Permissions tab.

- Step 3: In the Access control list (ACL) section, choose Edit to modify the ACL configuration available for the selected S3 bucket.

- Step 4: Under ACL, deselect the Write permission checkbox available next to the Everyone (public access) grantee in the Objects column, to remove the WRITE (UPLOAD/DELETE) permissions for anonymous users, from the selected Amazon S3 bucket. You can save the new Settings.
