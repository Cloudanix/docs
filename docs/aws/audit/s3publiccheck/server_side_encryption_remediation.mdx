### Remediation

How to ensure that your S3 buckets are protecting their sensitive data at rest by enforcing Server-Side Encryption?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: Select the S3 bucket to reconfigure (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource) and click the Properties tab from the dashboard top-right menu:
- Step 2: click Permissions and then Click the Edit bucket policy button. If the selected bucket does not have an access policy defined, click Add bucket policy

- Step 3: In the Bucket Policy Editor dialog box, perform one of the following actions based on your configuration:
  A: If there is no access policy currently in use, paste the following policy document in the Bucket Policy Editor box, replace the bucket name, i.e. cc-client-data, with the name of your own S3 bucket then click Save. This policy will enforce the owner and the users that have access to the bucket to enable Server-Side Encryption for every object uploaded via Management Console or via AWS API:
  {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "PutObjPolicy",
  "Statement": [
  {
  "Sid": "DenyIncorrectEncryptionHeader",
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "s3:PutObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::cc-client-data/*",
  "Condition": {
  "StringNotEquals": {
  "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
  }
  }
  },
  {
  "Sid": "DenyUnEncryptedObjectUploads",
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "s3:PutObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::cc-client-data/*",
  "Condition": {
  "Null": {
  "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "true"
  }
  }
  }
  ]
  }
  B: If the selected bucket has already an access policy implemented, Add the following policy statements (highlighted) to the existing ones available within the Bucket Policy Editor box, as shown in the following example:
  {
  "Id": "S3BucketAccessPolicy",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
  {
  ...
  },
  {
  **"Sid": "DenyIncorrectEncryptionHeader",**
  **"Effect": "Deny",**
  **"Principal": "*",**
  **"Action": "s3:PutObject",**
  **"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::cc-client-data/*",**
  **"Condition": {**
  **"StringNotEquals": {**
  **"s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"**
  **}**
  **}**
  **},**
  **{**
  **"Sid": "DenyUnEncryptedObjectUploads",**
  **"Effect": "Deny",**
  **"Principal": "*",**
  **"Action": "s3:PutObject",**
  **"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::cc-client-data/*",**
  **"Condition": {**
  **"Null": {**
  **"s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "true"**
  **}**
  **}**
  **}**
  ]
  }
  Replace the bucket name, i.e. cc-client-data, with your own bucket then click the Save to apply the policy changes. This policy will enforce the owner and the users that have access to the bucket to enable Server-Side Encryption for every object uploaded via Management Console, via CLI or programmatically via AWS API.

- Step 7: To test the Server-Side Encryption feature implementation, perform the following actions:
  A: Select the SSE-enabled S3 bucket and click the Upload from the dashboard top menu.
  B: In the Upload - Select Files and Folders dialog box, click Add files to upload a simple text file.
  C: Click Set Details button to set additional details for the object uploaded at the previous step.
  D: On the Set Details page, check Use Server Side Encryption checkbox then click Start Upload to upload the file to your bucket. If your file is uploaded to S3 without returning any errors during the process, the Server-Side Encryption has been successfully enabled.

#### **Default Encryption**

- Step 1: Click on the name/link of the S3 bucket you want to reconfigure (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource).

- Step 2: Select the Properties tab from the S3 dashboard top menu and click on the Default encryption feature configuration box.

- Step 3: Inside the box, select one of the following options, based on your requirements:
  A: Select AES-256 option to use Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) to encrypt your S3 objects automatically at upload.
  B: Select AWS-KMS option to use Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS) to encrypt your S3 objects. If you choose this option, you must select a KMS-managed key from Select a key dropdown list or provide the ARN of your custom key inside Custom KMS ARN box.

- Step 4: Click Save to apply the changes and enable default encryption for the selected Amazon S3 bucket.
