### Remediation

How to ensure that there should not be any publicly accessible S3 buckets available in your AWS account?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: Click on the name of the S3 bucket that you want to reconfigure.

- Step 2: Select the Permissions tab from the console menu to access the bucket permissions.

- Step 3: In the Access control list (ACL) section, choose Edit to modify the Access Control List (ACL) configuration available for the selected bucket.

- Step 4: Under ACL, deselect all the permissions listed next to the Everyone (public access) grantee, i.e. List, Write from Objects and Read, Write from Bucket ACL, to deny public/anonymous FULL_CONTROL access to the selected Amazon S3 bucket. Select I understand the effects of these changes on my objects and buckets checkbox for confirmation, then choose Save changes.
