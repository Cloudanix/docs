### Remediation

How to ensure that the content of your Amazon S3 buckets can't be listed by anonymous users?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: Click on the S3 bucket that you want to reconfigure.

- Step 2: Select the Permissions tab from the console menu to access the bucket permissions.

- Step 3: In the Access control list (ACL) section, choose Edit to modify ACL configuration available for the selected S3 bucket.

- Step 4: Under ACL, deselect the List permission checkbox available next to the Everyone (public access) grantee, to remove the LIST (READ) permissions for anonymous users, from the selected Amazon S3 bucket. Select I understand the effects of these changes on my objects and buckets checkbox for confirmation, then choose Save changes to apply the changes.
