- Step 3: Scroll to Bucket Policy and click Edit.

    src="/images/aws/audit/aws_s3_s3_https_step3.png"
  />

- Step 4: Write the policy document: "Condition": { "Bool": { "aws:SecureTransport": "true" } }, when the Effect element value is set to "Allow". If the Effect element is "Deny" then the condition will be "Condition": { "Bool": { "aws:SecureTransport": "false" } } as shown in the image below. Now only SSL traffic will be allowed to your S3 bucket.

* Condition: Allow
