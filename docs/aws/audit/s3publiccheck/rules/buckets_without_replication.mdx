How to enable S3 bucket replication?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console: Sign in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the S3 service: Search for "S3" in the AWS Management Console search bar or find it in the services menu.
3. Select the source bucket: Click on the name of the bucket that you want to replicate.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Bucket Replication Should Be Enabled" Policy.)
4. Enable versioning: If versioning is not already enabled for the source bucket, enable it by selecting the "Properties" tab, scrolling down to the "Versioning" section, and clicking on the "Enable versioning" button. Bucket versioning is required for replication.
5. Click on the "Management" tab: In the bucket properties, click on the "Management" tab.
6. Click on "Replication" and then "Add rule": Under "Management options," click on "Replication" and then click on the "Add rule" button.
7. Configure replication rule:
   a. Choose the destination: Select the destination bucket where you want to replicate the data. You can choose an existing bucket or create a new one.
   b. Set the rule name: Provide a unique name for the replication rule.
   c. Configure replication options: Specify the replication options such as storage class, encryption, and prefix filters.
   d. Review and save the rule: Review the configuration and click on the "Save" button to save the replication rule.
8. Configure permissions for the destination bucket: Grant the necessary permissions to the destination bucket to allow replication. This includes granting the "s3:ReplicateObject" permission to the bucket policy or the IAM role associated with the destination bucket.
9. Monitor the replication: Once replication is enabled, the source bucket's data will be automatically replicated to the destination bucket. You can monitor the replication progress and status in the S3 console.
