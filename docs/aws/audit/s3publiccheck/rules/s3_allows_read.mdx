### Remediation

How to ensure that the content of your Amazon S3 buckets can't be listed by anonymous users?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the Amazon S3 console by navigating to the "Services" menu and selecting "S3" under the "Storage" section.
3. Select the bucket for which you want to manage access permissions.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Buckets Should Not Allow Public READ Access" Policy.)
4. Click on the "Permissions" tab in the bucket details.
5. In the "Access control list (ACL)" section, make sure that the "Everyone" group does not have any permissions that grant the "List" action.
   - If you find any permission that grants the "List" action to the "Everyone" group, select the permission and click on the "Remove" button to revoke it.
6. In the "Bucket policy" section, review the bucket policy to ensure that there are no statements granting the "s3:ListBucket" action to the "Principal" or "AWS" field with a value of "*", which represents anonymous users.
   - If you find any such statements, edit the bucket policy and remove or modify them accordingly to disallow listing by anonymous users.
   For example, the following statement grants public listing access to anonymous users:
   ```
   "Statement": [
       {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": "*",
           "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name"
       }
   ]
   ```
7. In the "Access control list (ACL)" and "Bucket policy" sections, make sure that the appropriate permissions are granted to the desired principals or groups for authorized access, while ensuring that anonymous users are not granted the ability to list the bucket's contents.
8. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.
