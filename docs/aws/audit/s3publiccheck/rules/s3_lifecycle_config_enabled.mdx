How to enable lifecycle config for S3 bucket?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
2. Click on the name of the existing S3 bucket for which you want to enable a lifecycle configuration.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Buckets Should Have Lifecycle Configuration Enabled" Policy.)
3. In the bucket details page, click on the "Management" tab.
4. Under the "Lifecycle" section, click on the "Add lifecycle rule" button.
5. In the "Add lifecycle rule" window, specify the rule details:
   - Rule name: Enter a descriptive name for the lifecycle rule.
   - Prefix: Specify the prefix or key name pattern that identifies the objects to which the rule applies. For example, entering "documents/" would apply the rule to objects with keys starting with "documents/".
   - Transitions: Configure the object transitions, which define when objects are moved to different storage classes. You can specify a transition after a certain number of days or on a specific date.
   - Expiration: Set an expiration for objects to automatically delete them after a certain number of days or on a specific date.
   - Noncurrent version expiration: Specify an expiration for noncurrent versions of objects.
   - Noncurrent version transitions: Configure transitions for noncurrent versions to move them to different storage classes.
6. Review the lifecycle rule configuration to ensure it meets your requirements.
7. Click on the "Save" button to enable the lifecycle configuration for the bucket.
8. The lifecycle rule will take effect immediately, and Amazon S3 will automatically manage objects based on the specified rules.
