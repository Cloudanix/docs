1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.

2. In the Bucket name list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to check for public access.

3. Choose the Permissions tab. Under the "Block public access" section, you can see the current public access settings for the selected bucket.

4. Under the "Access Control List" section, check the "Public access" column. If it says "Everyone" with "List objects" or "Write objects" permissions, then the bucket is publicly accessible. If it says "Public access: Everyone has FULL_CONTROL permission", then the bucket allows public FULL_CONTROL access.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all S3 buckets: Use the following command to list all the S3 buckets in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws s3api list-buckets --query "Buckets[].Name"
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the S3 bucket names.

3. Check bucket policy: For each bucket, you need to check the bucket policy to see if it allows public FULL_CONTROL access. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> --query Policy
   ```
   Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket you want to check. This command will return the bucket policy in JSON format.

4. Parse the policy: You need to parse the returned policy to see if it contains a statement that allows public FULL_CONTROL access. You can do this by looking for a statement where the "Effect" is "Allow", the "Principal" is "*", and the "Action" is "s3:*". If such a statement exists, then the bucket allows public FULL_CONTROL access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the Boto3 library. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to interact with AWS services. You can configure it in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   Then, input your access key, secret access key, and your preferred AWS region when prompted.

3. Write a Python script to check S3 bucket permissions: The following script lists all your S3 buckets and checks if they allow public FULL_CONTROL access:

   ```python
   import boto3

   s3 = boto3.client('s3')

   # List all S3 buckets
   buckets = s3.list_buckets()
   for bucket in buckets['Buckets']:
       # Get bucket policy
       policy = s3.get_bucket_policy(Bucket=bucket['Name'])
       # Check if policy allows public FULL_CONTROL access
       if 'Statement' in policy['Policy']:
           for statement in policy['Policy']['Statement']:
               if (statement['Effect'] == 'Allow' and
                   'Principal' in statement and
                   statement['Principal'] == '*' and
                   'Action' in statement and
                   statement['Action'] == 's3:*' and
                   'Resource' in statement and
                   statement['Resource'] == f"arn:aws:s3:::{bucket['Name']}/*"):
                   print(f"Bucket {bucket['Name']} allows public FULL_CONTROL access")
   ```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python check_s3_permissions.py
   ```

   The script will print the names of all S3 buckets that allow public FULL_CONTROL access. If no such buckets exist, it will print nothing.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the S3 bucket misconfiguration in AWS:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.

2. Click on the name of the bucket that has the public FULL_CONTROL access.

3. Click on the "Permissions" tab and then select "Bucket Policy".

4. Review the policy to see if there is any statement that grants public FULL_CONTROL access. 

5. If there is any statement that grants public FULL_CONTROL access, remove it from the policy by editing the JSON policy document.

6. Alternatively, you can also revoke the public FULL_CONTROL access by selecting the "Access Control List" (ACL) tab and then removing the "Everyone" grantee with FULL_CONTROL access.

7. Once you have made the necessary changes, click on the "Save" button to save the updated policy or ACL.

8. Finally, test the bucket to ensure that the public FULL_CONTROL access has been remediated. 

By following the above steps, you can remediate the S3 bucket misconfiguration to ensure that it does not allow public FULL_CONTROL access.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this misconfiguration, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open your terminal and install the AWS CLI if you haven't installed it already.

2. Run the following command to list all the S3 buckets in your account:

   ```
   aws s3api list-buckets
   ```

3. Identify the bucket that has public FULL_CONTROL access.

4. Run the following command to remove the public FULL_CONTROL access from the bucket:

   ```
   aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private
   ```

   Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket that you identified in step 3.

5. Verify that the public FULL_CONTROL access has been removed by running the following command:

   ```
   aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
   ```

   Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket that you identified in step 3. The output should show that there are no grants with the permission "FULL_CONTROL" for "AllUsers" or "AuthenticatedUsers".

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for any other buckets that have public FULL_CONTROL access.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of allowing public FULL_CONTROL access to an S3 bucket in AWS.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of an S3 bucket allowing public FULL_CONTROL access, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.

2. Select the bucket that you want to remediate.

3. Click on the "Permissions" tab and then click on the "Access control list (ACL)" option.

4. Locate the "Grantee" that is set to "Everyone" and has "FULL_CONTROL" permissions.

5. Remove the "Grantee" by clicking on the "x" icon next to it.

6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

To automate this process using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and follow these steps:

1. Install the Boto3 library by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Create a new Python file and import the necessary libraries:

```python
import boto3
```

3. Create a new S3 client:

```python
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
```

4. Retrieve the ACL of the bucket:

```python
bucket_acl = s3.get_bucket_acl(Bucket='your-bucket-name')
```

5. Loop through the ACL and remove any grant that has "FULL_CONTROL" permissions for the "AllUsers" group:

```python
for grant in bucket_acl['Grants']:
    if grant['Grantee']['Type'] == 'Group' and grant['Grantee']['URI'] == 'http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers' and grant['Permission'] == 'FULL_CONTROL':
        s3.put_bucket_acl(Bucket='your-bucket-name', AccessControlPolicy={'Grants': [g for g in bucket_acl['Grants'] if g != grant], 'Owner': bucket_acl['Owner']})
```

6. Run the Python script and check the S3 bucket to confirm that the public FULL_CONTROL access has been removed.

Note: Make sure to replace "your-bucket-name" with the name of your actual S3 bucket.
