How to ensure S3 Bucket names are DNS compliant?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
2. Click on the name of the existing S3 bucket for which you want to validate the DNS compliance of the name.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Bucket Names Should Be DNS-compliant" Policy.)
3. In the bucket details page, click on the "Properties" tab.
4. Under the "Bucket name" section, review the current bucket name.
5. Verify that the bucket name follows the DNS naming conventions:
   - The bucket name must be at least 3 and no more than 63 characters long.
   - The name can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and periods (.).
   - The name cannot start or end with a hyphen or period.
   - The name cannot have consecutive periods.
   - The name cannot be formatted as an IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
6. If the bucket name already adheres to the DNS naming conventions, it is considered DNS compliant.
7. If the bucket name is not compliant, you will need to modify it to meet the DNS naming requirements.
   a. To modify the bucket name, click on the "Edit bucket name" button or find the option to rename the bucket.
   b. Enter a new bucket name that is DNS compliant and follows the naming conventions.
   c. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.
8. Once you have a DNS-compliant bucket name, the bucket is considered DNS compliant.
9. Repeat these steps for any other existing S3 buckets that need to be checked for DNS compliance.
