#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the Amazon S3 console by navigating to the "Services" menu and selecting "S3" under the "Storage" section.

    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Bucket Should Not Allow WRITE Access to Authenticated Users" Policy.)
4. Click on the "Permissions" tab in the bucket details.
5. In the "Access control list (ACL)" section, ensure that the "Authenticated Users" group does not have any permissions that grant WRITE access. 
   - If you find any permission that grants WRITE access to the "Authenticated Users" group, select the permission and click on the "Remove" button to revoke it.
6. In the "Bucket policy" section, review the bucket policy to ensure that there are no statements granting WRITE access to the "AuthenticatedUsers" principal.
   - If you find any such statements, edit the bucket policy and remove or modify them accordingly to disallow WRITE access to the "AuthenticatedUsers" principal.
7. In the "Access control list (ACL)" and "Bucket policy" sections, make sure that the appropriate permissions are granted to the desired principals or groups for READ access, while ensuring that WRITE access is restricted as required.
8. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.
