How to enable Default Encryption On Your S3 Buckets?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Buckets Should Have Default Encryption Enabled" Policy.)
2. Navigate to the S3 service by selecting "S3" from the services menu.
3. In the S3 dashboard, locate the bucket that does not have default encryption enabled.
4. Click on the bucket name to access the bucket's configuration settings.
5. In the bucket properties, select the "Properties" tab.
6. Scroll down to the "Default encryption" section.
7. Click on the "Edit" button next to "Default encryption" to modify the encryption settings.
8. In the "Edit default encryption configuration" dialog box, choose the encryption option you want to enable, such as SSE-S3 (server-side encryption with S3-managed keys) or SSE-KMS (server-side encryption with KMS-managed keys).
   - SSE-S3: AWS S3 will automatically encrypt objects using S3-managed keys.
   - SSE-KMS: AWS S3 will automatically encrypt objects using keys managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
9. Select the desired encryption option and click on the "Save" button to enable default encryption for the bucket.
10. Once saved, the bucket will now have default encryption enabled, and any new objects uploaded to the bucket will be automatically encrypted using the specified encryption method.
11. Review the bucket's encryption settings and verify that default encryption is now enabled.
