### Remediation

How to ensure that your AWS S3 buckets content cannot be listed by AWS authenticated accounts or IAM users?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the Amazon S3 console by navigating to the "Services" menu and selecting "S3" under the "Storage" section.
3. Select the bucket for which you want to manage access permissions.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Bucket Should Not Allow READ Access to Authenticated Users" Policy.)
4. Click on the "Permissions" tab in the bucket details.
5. In the "Access control list (ACL)" section, review the permissions granted to the "Authenticated Users" group and any specific IAM users.
   - Make sure that the "Authenticated Users" group and IAM users do not have any permissions that grant the "List" action.
   - If you find any such permissions, select them and click on the "Remove" button to revoke the permissions.
6. In the "Bucket policy" section, review the bucket policy to ensure that there are no statements granting the "s3:ListBucket" action to the "Principal" or "AWS" field with values representing AWS authenticated accounts or IAM users.
   - If you find any such statements, edit the bucket policy and remove or modify them accordingly to disallow listing by authenticated accounts or IAM users.
   For example, the following statement grants listing access to IAM users:
   ```
   "Statement": [
       {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": {
               "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/username"
           },
           "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name"
       }
   ]
   ```
7. In the "Access control list (ACL)" and "Bucket policy" sections, make sure that the appropriate permissions are granted to the desired principals or groups for authorized access, while ensuring that authenticated accounts and IAM users are not granted the ability to list the bucket's contents.
8. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.
