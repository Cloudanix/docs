### Remediation

How to fix S3 Buckets Public Access via Policy?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Buckets Should Not Allow Public Access Via Policy" Policy.)
2. Navigate to the Amazon S3 service by searching for "S3" in the AWS services search bar and selecting "S3" from the results.
3. In the S3 dashboard, locate and click on the name of the bucket that you want to secure.
4. Inside the bucket, click on the "Permissions" tab.
5. Under the "Access control list (ACL)" section, click on the "Bucket policy" sub-tab.
6. Review the existing bucket policy to understand the permissions that are allowing public access. Take note of the policy statements that grant public access.
7. Once you have understood the policy, click on the "Edit" button to modify the bucket policy.
8. In the bucket policy editor, remove or modify the policy statements that grant public access. If you want to completely disallow public access, you can replace the entire bucket policy with the following policy, which denies all public access:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyPublicAccess",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*",
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
   Replace "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME" with the actual name of your S3 bucket.
   
9. Once you have modified the bucket policy, click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.
10. The bucket policy will be updated, and public access via the policy will be disabled.
se steps, you can remediate the issue of AWS S3 bucket allowing public access via a bucket policy and ensure that your bucket is secured.
