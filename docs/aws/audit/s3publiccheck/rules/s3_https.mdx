title: S3 Buckets Should Have A Secure Transport Policy
---

### More Info:

AWS S3 buckets should enforce encryption of data over the network (as it travels to and from Amazon S3) using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

### Risk Level

High

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

PCIDSS, SOC2, HIPAA, ISO27001, CIS

### Remediation

How to enable Default Encryption On Your S3 Buckets?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon S3 service by searching for "S3" in the AWS services search bar and selecting "S3" from the results.
3. In the S3 dashboard, locate and click on the name of the bucket that you want to secure.
4. Inside the bucket, click on the "Properties" tab.
5. Scroll down to the "Default Encryption" section and click on the "Edit" button next to it.
6. In the "Default Encryption" dialog box, select the encryption option you want to enable for the bucket. You have the following options:
   - "AES-256": This option enables server-side encryption using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).
   - "AWS Key Management Service (KMS)": This option enables server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service keys (SSE-KMS).
   - "None": This option disables default encryption, but it is not recommended for security purposes.
   
   Choose the appropriate encryption option based on your requirements and compliance needs.
7. After selecting the encryption option, click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.
8. Next, you need to configure a bucket policy to enforce secure transport (HTTPS) for all incoming requests. Click on the "Permissions" tab within the bucket.
9. Under the "Bucket Policy" section, click on the "Edit" button to define a new policy.
10. In the bucket policy editor, add or update the policy statement to enforce secure transport. Here's an example policy that allows access only via HTTPS:
   
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "EnforceSecureTransport",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyInsecureAccess",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME",
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
   Replace "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME" with the actual name of your S3 bucket.
   
11. Once you have defined the policy, click on the "Save" button to apply it.
12. The bucket will now enforce secure transport for all incoming requests. Any attempts to access the bucket via HTTP will be denied.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of the AWS S3 bucket allowing unencrypted access and enforce secure transport (HTTPS) for your S3 bucket.
