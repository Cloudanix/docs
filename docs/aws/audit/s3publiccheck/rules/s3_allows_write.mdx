### Remediation

How to fix S3 Buckets Public Writes enabled?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Buckets Should Not Allow Public Writes" Policy.)
2. Navigate to the Amazon S3 service by searching for "S3" in the AWS services search bar and selecting "S3" from the results.
3. In the S3 dashboard, locate and click on the name of the bucket that you want to secure.
4. Inside the bucket, click on the "Permissions" tab.
5. Under the "Public access settings" section, you will see a warning stating that the bucket allows public write access. Click on the "Edit" button next to it.
6. In the "Manage public access settings" dialog box, uncheck the checkboxes for any public access settings that allow write access. These may include "Block new public ACLs and uploading public objects (Recommended)" and "Remove public access granted through public ACLs (Recommended)."
7. A confirmation warning will appear. Read the warning carefully, as disabling public write access might impact any applications or services relying on it. If you are sure about your actions, click on the "Confirm" button.
8. Once you have confirmed, the bucket's public write access settings will be updated. The warning about allowing public write access should no longer be present.
9. It is recommended to review the bucket policies and access control list (ACL) for any explicit public write permissions. You can find the bucket policy under the "Permissions" tab in the "Bucket policy" sub-tab and the ACL under the "Access control list (ACL)" sub-tab. Remove any entries that allow public write access unless necessary for your specific use case.
10. To further secure your S3 bucket, consider implementing other security measures like using IAM policies, bucket policies, or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to control access to the bucket and its objects. You can grant specific users or roles the necessary permissions to write to the bucket while denying public write access.
