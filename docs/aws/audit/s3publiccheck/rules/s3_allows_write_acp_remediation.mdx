How to ensure that your Amazon S3 buckets are not configured to allow anonymous users to modify access control permissions?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: Click on the name of the S3 bucket that you want to reconfigure.

- Step 2: Select the Permissions tab from the console menu to access the bucket permissions.

- Step 3: In the Access control list (ACL) section, choose Edit to modify the Access Control List (ACL) configuration available for the selected S3 bucket.

- Step 4: Under ACL, deselect the Write permission checkbox available next to the Everyone (public access) grantee in the Bucket ACL column, to remove the WRITE_ACP (EDIT) permissions for anonymous users, from the selected Amazon S3 bucket. Select I understand the effects of these changes on my objects and buckets checkbox for confirmation, then choose Save changes to apply the changes.
