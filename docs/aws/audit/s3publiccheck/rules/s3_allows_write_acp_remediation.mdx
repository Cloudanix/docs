### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.

2. In the Bucket name list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to check for public WRITE_ACP access.

3. Choose the Permissions tab.

4. Under the Bucket Policy section, look for any statements with "Action": "s3:PutBucketAcl" or "s3:PutObjectAcl" and "Effect": "Allow". If the "Principal" in these statements is set to "*", this means the bucket is publicly accessible for WRITE_ACP access.

5. Additionally, under the Access Control List (ACL) section, check if "Everyone" or "Any authenticated AWS user" has the "WRITE_ACP" permission. If they do, this means the bucket allows public WRITE_ACP access.

Remember, this is just the detection part. If you find any misconfigurations, you should take steps to remediate them to secure your S3 bucket.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by downloading the appropriate installer from the AWS website. Once installed, you can configure it by running `aws configure` and providing your AWS access key ID, secret access key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all S3 buckets: Use the following command to list all the S3 buckets in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws s3api list-buckets --query 'Buckets[].Name'
   ```

3. Check bucket policy: For each bucket, you need to check the bucket policy to see if it allows public WRITE_ACP access. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket your-bucket-name --query 'Policy'
   ```

4. Analyze the policy: The above command will return a JSON object representing the bucket's policy. You need to analyze this policy to see if it contains a statement with `"Effect": "Allow"`, `"Principal": "*"`, and `"Action": "s3:PutBucketAcl"`. If such a statement exists, it means the bucket allows public WRITE_ACP access.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the Boto3 library. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials: Before you can interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a file at ~/.aws/credentials. At the very least, the contents of the file should be:

   ```bash
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check S3 bucket permissions: The following script will list all your S3 buckets and check if they allow public WRITE_ACP access.

   ```python
   import boto3

   s3 = boto3.client('s3')

   # List all S3 buckets
   buckets = s3.list_buckets()
   for bucket in buckets['Buckets']:
       # Get bucket policy
       policy = s3.get_bucket_acl(Bucket=bucket['Name'])
       for grant in policy['Grants']:
           # Check if the bucket allows public WRITE_ACP access
           if grant['Permission'] == 'WRITE_ACP' and grant['Grantee']['Type'] == 'Group' and grant['Grantee']['URI'] == 'http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers':
               print(f"Bucket {bucket['Name']} allows public WRITE_ACP access")
   ```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using the Python interpreter. The script will print the names of all S3 buckets that allow public WRITE_ACP access.

   ```bash
   python check_s3_permissions.py
   ```
   
Please note that this script only checks for public WRITE_ACP access. Other types of public access, such as READ or WRITE, are not checked by this script.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "S3 Bucket Should Not Allow Public WRITE_ACP Access" for AWS using the AWS console, please follow the below steps:

1. Log in to your AWS console.
2. Navigate to S3 service.
3. Select the bucket that has public WRITE_ACP access.
4. Click on the "Permissions" tab.
5. Scroll down to "Access Control List (ACL)" and click on it.
6. Look for any entries that have the "Grantee" set to "All Users" or "Authenticated Users".
7. If you find any such entries, select them and click on the "Revoke" button to remove the public WRITE_ACP access.
8. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Once you have completed the above steps, your S3 bucket will no longer have public WRITE_ACP access and will be remediated.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "S3 Bucket Should Not Allow Public WRITE_ACP Access" for AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Identify the S3 bucket that is allowing public WRITE_ACP access. You can use the following command to list all the S3 buckets in your AWS account:
```
aws s3api list-buckets
```

3. Once you have identified the bucket, you can use the following command to update the bucket policy to remove public WRITE_ACP access:
```
aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME --acl private
```
Replace BUCKET_NAME with the name of the S3 bucket that you want to update.

4. Verify that the bucket policy has been updated successfully by running the following command:
```
aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME
```
Replace BUCKET_NAME with the name of the S3 bucket that you updated in step 3.

5. Check if the misconfiguration has been remediated by running a security scan or audit on your AWS account. 

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "S3 Bucket Should Not Allow Public WRITE_ACP Access" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of S3 Bucket allowing public WRITE_ACP access in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) using the following command:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Create a boto3 S3 client object using the following code:

```
import boto3
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
```

3. Get the bucket policy using the `get_bucket_policy` method of the S3 client object:

```
bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'
bucket_policy = s3.get_bucket_policy(Bucket=bucket_name)
```

4. Check if the bucket policy allows public WRITE_ACP access. You can use the following code to check this:

```
import json
bucket_policy_json = json.loads(bucket_policy['Policy'])
if 'Statement' in bucket_policy_json:
    for statement in bucket_policy_json['Statement']:
        if 'Effect' in statement and statement['Effect'] == 'Allow':
            if 'Principal' in statement and statement['Principal'] == '*':
                if 'Action' in statement and 's3:PutBucketAcl' in statement['Action']:
                    print('Public WRITE_ACP access is allowed')
```

5. If the bucket policy allows public WRITE_ACP access, you can remove it using the `put_bucket_acl` method of the S3 client object. You can use the following code to remove the public WRITE_ACP access:

```
response = s3.put_bucket_acl(
    Bucket=bucket_name,
    ACL='private'
)
```

This will set the bucket ACL to private and remove the public WRITE_ACP access.
