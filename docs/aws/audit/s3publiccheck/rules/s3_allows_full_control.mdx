How to fix S3 Buckets Public FULL_CONTROL access?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Bucket Should Not Allow Public FULL_CONTROL Access" Policy.)
2. Navigate to the Amazon S3 service by searching for "S3" in the AWS services search bar and selecting "S3" from the results.
3. In the S3 dashboard, locate and click on the name of the bucket that you want to secure.
4. Inside the bucket, click on the "Permissions" tab.
5. Under the "Access control list (ACL)" section, click on the "Bucket policy" sub-tab.
6. Review the existing bucket policy to understand the permissions that grant public FULL_CONTROL access. Take note of the policy statements that allow such access.
7. Once you have understood the policy, click on the "Edit" button to modify the bucket policy.
8. In the bucket policy editor, remove or modify the policy statements that grant public FULL_CONTROL access. You can remove the entire bucket policy if it's not needed or replace the policy with a more restrictive one that only grants appropriate access to specific users or roles.
9. Once you have modified the bucket policy, click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.
10. The bucket policy will be updated, and public FULL_CONTROL access will be disabled.
