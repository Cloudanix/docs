### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Login to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
2. In the S3 dashboard, you will see a list of all your S3 buckets. Click on the name of the bucket that you want to check.
3. Once you're in the bucket, click on the 'Permissions' tab.
4. Under the 'Access Control List (ACL)' section, check the 'Public access' settings. If 'Everyone' or 'Any authenticated AWS user' has 'FULL_CONTROL' listed under their permissions, then the bucket is misconfigured and allows public FULL_CONTROL access.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all S3 buckets: Use the following command to list all the S3 buckets in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws s3api list-buckets --query "Buckets[].Name"
   ```

3. Check bucket policy: For each bucket, you need to check the bucket policy to see if it allows public FULL_CONTROL access. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket your-bucket-name --query 'Policy'
   ```

   Replace 'your-bucket-name' with the name of your bucket. This command will return the bucket policy in JSON format.

4. Analyze the policy: Look for any statements in the policy that have 'Effect': 'Allow', 'Principal': '*', and 'Action': 's3:*'. This combination means that the bucket allows public FULL_CONTROL access. If you find any such statements, then the bucket is misconfigured.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the Boto3 library. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials: Before you can interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a file at ~/.aws/credentials. At the very least, the contents of the file should be:

   ```bash
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check S3 bucket permissions: The following script will list all your S3 buckets and check if they have public FULL_CONTROL access.

   ```python
   import boto3

   s3 = boto3.client('s3')

   # List all S3 buckets
   buckets = s3.list_buckets()
   for bucket in buckets['Buckets']:
       # Get bucket policy
       policy = s3.get_bucket_policy(Bucket=bucket['Name'])
       # Check if policy grants public FULL_CONTROL access
       if 'Statement' in policy:
           for statement in policy['Statement']:
               if statement['Effect'] == 'Allow' and 'Principal' in statement and statement['Principal'] == '*' and 'FULL_CONTROL' in statement['Action']:
                   print(f"Bucket {bucket['Name']} allows public FULL_CONTROL access")
   ```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using the Python interpreter. The script will print the names of all S3 buckets that allow public FULL_CONTROL access.

   ```bash
   python check_s3_permissions.py
   ```
   
Please note that this script only checks for explicit FULL_CONTROL permissions granted to all users (*). It does not check for other permissions that might effectively grant full control, or for permissions granted to specific users.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the S3 bucket misconfiguration in AWS:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.

2. Click on the name of the bucket that has the public FULL_CONTROL access.

3. Click on the "Permissions" tab and then select "Bucket Policy".

4. Review the policy to see if there is any statement that grants public FULL_CONTROL access. 

5. If there is any statement that grants public FULL_CONTROL access, remove it from the policy by editing the JSON policy document.

6. Alternatively, you can also revoke the public FULL_CONTROL access by selecting the "Access Control List" (ACL) tab and then removing the "Everyone" grantee with FULL_CONTROL access.

7. Once you have made the necessary changes, click on the "Save" button to save the updated policy or ACL.

8. Finally, test the bucket to ensure that the public FULL_CONTROL access has been remediated. 

By following the above steps, you can remediate the S3 bucket misconfiguration to ensure that it does not allow public FULL_CONTROL access.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open your terminal and install the AWS CLI if you haven't installed it already.

2. Run the following command to list all the S3 buckets in your account:

   ```
   aws s3api list-buckets
   ```

3. Identify the bucket that has public FULL_CONTROL access.

4. Run the following command to remove the public FULL_CONTROL access from the bucket:

   ```
   aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private
   ```

   Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket that you identified in step 3.

5. Verify that the public FULL_CONTROL access has been removed by running the following command:

   ```
   aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
   ```

   Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket that you identified in step 3. The output should show that there are no grants with the permission "FULL_CONTROL" for "AllUsers" or "AuthenticatedUsers".

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for any other buckets that have public FULL_CONTROL access.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of allowing public FULL_CONTROL access to an S3 bucket in AWS.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of an S3 bucket allowing public FULL_CONTROL access, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.

2. Select the bucket that you want to remediate.

3. Click on the "Permissions" tab and then click on the "Access control list (ACL)" option.

4. Locate the "Grantee" that is set to "Everyone" and has "FULL_CONTROL" permissions.

5. Remove the "Grantee" by clicking on the "x" icon next to it.

6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

To automate this process using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and follow these steps:

1. Install the Boto3 library by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Create a new Python file and import the necessary libraries:

```python
import boto3
```

3. Create a new S3 client:

```python
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
```

4. Retrieve the ACL of the bucket:

```python
bucket_acl = s3.get_bucket_acl(Bucket='your-bucket-name')
```

5. Loop through the ACL and remove any grant that has "FULL_CONTROL" permissions for the "AllUsers" group:

```python
for grant in bucket_acl['Grants']:
    if grant['Grantee']['Type'] == 'Group' and grant['Grantee']['URI'] == 'http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers' and grant['Permission'] == 'FULL_CONTROL':
        s3.put_bucket_acl(Bucket='your-bucket-name', AccessControlPolicy={'Grants': [g for g in bucket_acl['Grants'] if g != grant], 'Owner': bucket_acl['Owner']})
```

6. Run the Python script and check the S3 bucket to confirm that the public FULL_CONTROL access has been removed.

Note: Make sure to replace "your-bucket-name" with the name of your actual S3 bucket.
