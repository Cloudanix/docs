### Remediation

How to ensure that your AWS S3 buckets content cannot be listed by AWS authenticated accounts or IAM users?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the Amazon S3 console by navigating to the "Services" menu and selecting "S3" under the "Storage" section.
3. Select the bucket for which you want to manage access permissions.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Bucket Should Not Allow READ_ACP Access For Authenticated Users" Policy.)
4. Click on the "Permissions" tab in the bucket details.
5. In the "Access control list (ACL)" section, review the permissions granted to the "Authenticated Users" group.
6. If the "Authenticated Users" group has the `READ_ACP` permission, select it and click on the "Remove" button to revoke the permission.
7. In the "Bucket policy" section, review the bucket policy to ensure that there are no statements granting the `s3:GetBucketAcl` or `s3:GetObjectAcl` actions to the "Authenticated Users" group.
   - If you find any such statements, edit the bucket policy and remove or modify them accordingly to disallow the `READ_ACP` permissions for authenticated users.
   For example, the following statement grants `READ_ACP` permission to the "Authenticated Users" group:
   ```
   "Statement": [
       {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": {
               "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AuthenticatedUsers"
           },
           "Action": [
               "s3:GetBucketAcl",
               "s3:GetObjectAcl"
           ],
           "Resource": [
               "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
               "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
           ]
       }
   ]
   ```
8. In the "Access control list (ACL)" and "Bucket policy" sections, make sure that the appropriate permissions are granted to the desired principals or groups for authorized access, while ensuring that the `READ_ACP` permission is not allowed for authenticated users.
9. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.
