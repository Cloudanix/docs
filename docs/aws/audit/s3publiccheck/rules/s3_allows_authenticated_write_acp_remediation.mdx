### Remediation

How to ensure that S3 buckets do not allow authenticated AWS accounts or IAM users to modify access control permissions?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Bucket Should Not Allow WRITE_ACP Access to Authenticated Users" Policy.)
2. Navigate to the S3 service by selecting "S3" from the services menu.
3. In the S3 dashboard, locate the bucket that allows WRITE_ACP permission to authenticated users.
4. Click on the bucket name to access the bucket's configuration settings.
5. In the bucket properties, select the "Permissions" tab.
6. Scroll down to the "Access control list (ACL)" section.
7. Click on the "Edit" button next to the ACL to modify the bucket's access control settings.
8. In the "Edit bucket ACL" dialog box, review the existing access control entries.
9. Look for any entries that grant "WRITE_ACP" permission to "Authenticated Users" or similar permissions.
10. Select the entry that allows WRITE_ACP to "Authenticated Users" and click on the "Remove" or "Delete" button to remove the entry.
11. Repeat the previous step for any other access control entries that provide WRITE_ACP permission to authenticated users.
12. After removing the unnecessary access control entries, click on the "Save" button to save the changes to the bucket's ACL.
13. Next, scroll up to the "Bucket policy" section.
14. Click on the "Edit" button next to the bucket policy to modify the bucket's policy settings.
15. In the bucket policy editor, review the existing policy statements.
16. Look for any policy statements that grant "s3:PutBucketAcl" or similar permissions to "aws:PrincipalArn" or "arn:aws:iam::AWS-account-ID:root".
17. Remove or modify the policy statements that grant excessive permissions to "aws:PrincipalArn" or the root account.
18. Once the necessary changes have been made to the bucket policy, click on the "Save" button to save the updated policy.
19. Review the bucket's ACL and policy settings to ensure that WRITE_ACP permission to authenticated users has been remediated.
