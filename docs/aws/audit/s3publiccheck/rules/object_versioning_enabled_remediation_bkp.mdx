How to enable Object Versioning for S3 Bucket?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
2. In the S3 dashboard, click on the name of the bucket for which you want to enable object versioning.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Buckets Should Have Versioning Enabled" Policy.)
3. In the bucket details page, click on the "Properties" tab.
4. Under the "Advanced settings" section, locate the "Versioning" option and click on the "Edit" button.
5. In the "Versioning" window, select the "Enable versioning" option.
6. Click on the "Save changes" button to enable object versioning for the bucket.
7. Once versioning is enabled, Amazon S3 will automatically create a new version of an object whenever you upload or modify it. Each version of an object will have a unique version ID.
8. To view and manage the versions of objects in the bucket, go to the bucket's details page and click on the "Versions" tab. Here, you can see all the versions of objects along with their version IDs, size, and other details.
9. You can also perform actions on specific object versions, such as restoring a previous version, permanently deleting a version, or copying an older version to a different bucket.
