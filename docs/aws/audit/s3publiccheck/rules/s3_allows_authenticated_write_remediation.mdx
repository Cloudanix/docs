### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.

2. In the Bucket name list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to check for WRITE access.

3. Choose the Permissions tab, and then choose Bucket Policy.

4. In the Bucket policy editor, look for any statements that include "s3:PutObject" or "s3:*" in the "Action" section and "AuthenticatedUsers" or "*" in the "Principal" section. If such statements exist, it means the bucket allows WRITE access to authenticated users.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```

   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all S3 buckets: Use the following command to list all the S3 buckets in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws s3api list-buckets --query 'Buckets[].Name'
   ```

3. Check bucket policy: For each bucket, check the bucket policy to see if it allows WRITE access to authenticated users. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket bucket-name
   ```

   Replace "bucket-name" with the name of your bucket. This command will return the bucket policy in JSON format.

4. Analyze the bucket policy: Look for any statements in the policy that allow "s3:PutObject", "s3:PutObjectAcl", or "s3:PutObjectVersionAcl" actions for the "AuthenticatedUsers" group. If such statements exist, it means the bucket allows WRITE access to authenticated users.

#### Using Python

1. First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3` in your terminal.

2. Once Boto3 is installed, you can use it to interact with your AWS services. To check for S3 bucket misconfigurations, you need to create a Python script that uses Boto3 to list all your S3 buckets and their respective policies. Here is a sample script:

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def list_s3_buckets():
    response = s3.list_buckets()
    for bucket in response['Buckets']:
        print(f'Bucket Name: {bucket["Name"]}')
        get_bucket_policy(bucket["Name"])

def get_bucket_policy(bucket_name):
    try:
        result = s3.get_bucket_policy(Bucket=bucket_name)
        print(f'Bucket Policy: {result["Policy"]}')
    except:
        print(f'No policy for bucket: {bucket_name}')

list_s3_buckets()
```

3. This script will print out the names of all your S3 buckets and their respective policies. You need to manually check these policies to see if they allow WRITE access to authenticated users. Look for statements in the policy that have "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": "*", and "Action": "s3:PutObject".

4. To automate this process, you can modify the script to parse the policy and check for these conditions. Here is a modified version of the script that does this:

```python
import boto3
import json

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def list_s3_buckets():
    response = s3.list_buckets()
    for bucket in response['Buckets']:
        print(f'Bucket Name: {bucket["Name"]}')
        check_bucket_policy(bucket["Name"])

def check_bucket_policy(bucket_name):
    try:
        result = s3.get_bucket_policy(Bucket=bucket_name)
        policy = json.loads(result["Policy"])
        for statement in policy["Statement"]:
            if statement["Effect"] == "Allow" and statement["Principal"] == "*" and "s3:PutObject" in statement["Action"]:
                print(f'Bucket {bucket_name} allows WRITE access to authenticated users')
    except:
        print(f'No policy for bucket: {bucket_name}')

list_s3_buckets()
```

This script will print out the names of any S3 buckets that allow WRITE access to authenticated users.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the S3 Bucket Should Not Allow WRITE Access to Authenticated Users misconfiguration for AWS using AWS console:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the S3 service.
3. Select the bucket that is misconfigured.
4. Click on the "Permissions" tab.
5. Click on "Bucket Policy".
6. Remove any policies that allow write access to authenticated users.
7. You can also add a policy that explicitly denies write access to authenticated users.

Here is an example of a policy that denies write access to authenticated users:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DenyAuthenticatedUsers",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "*"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl",
                "s3:PutObjectVersionAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:PrincipalType": "AuthenticatedUser"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

8. Click on "Save" to apply the changes.

That's it! You have now successfully remediated the S3 Bucket Should Not Allow WRITE Access to Authenticated Users misconfiguration for AWS using AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of S3 bucket allowing WRITE access to authenticated users in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine and run the following command to list all the S3 buckets in your AWS account:

   `aws s3api list-buckets`

2. Identify the S3 bucket that has WRITE access to authenticated users.

3. Run the following command to remove WRITE access for authenticated users on the identified S3 bucket:

   `aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket bucket-name --grant-write "uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers"`

   Replace `bucket-name` with the name of the identified S3 bucket.

4. Run the following command to verify that authenticated users no longer have WRITE access to the S3 bucket:

   `aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket bucket-name`

   Replace `bucket-name` with the name of the identified S3 bucket.

5. Verify that the remediation has worked successfully by attempting to write to the S3 bucket using an authenticated user. The attempt should now fail.

By following the above steps, you have successfully remediated the issue of S3 Bucket allowing WRITE access to Authenticated Users in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "S3 Bucket Should Not Allow WRITE Access to Authenticated Users" in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to identify the S3 bucket that has WRITE access to authenticated users. You can use the following Python code to list all the S3 buckets and their ACLs:

```python
import boto3

# Create an S3 client
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# List all the S3 buckets
buckets = s3.list_buckets()

# Iterate through each bucket and print its ACL
for bucket in buckets['Buckets']:
    acl = s3.get_bucket_acl(Bucket=bucket['Name'])
    print(f"Bucket {bucket['Name']} ACL: {acl}")
```

2. Once you have identified the bucket with WRITE access to authenticated users, you can update its ACL to remove the WRITE access. You can use the following Python code to remove WRITE access from authenticated users:

```python
import boto3

# Create an S3 client
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# Set the bucket name and grantee type
bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'
grantee_type = 'AuthenticatedUsers'

# Get the bucket ACL
acl = s3.get_bucket_acl(Bucket=bucket_name)

# Iterate through each grant and remove WRITE access from authenticated users
for grant in acl['Grants']:
    if grant['Grantee']['Type'] == grantee_type:
        acl['Grants'].remove(grant)
        
# Set the updated ACL for the bucket
s3.put_bucket_acl(Bucket=bucket_name, AccessControlPolicy=acl)
```

3. Run the above code to remove WRITE access from authenticated users for the identified S3 bucket.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to update the ACL of the S3 bucket.
