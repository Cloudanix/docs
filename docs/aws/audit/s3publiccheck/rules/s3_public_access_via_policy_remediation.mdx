### Remediation

How do you ensure that S3 Buckets do Not Allow Public Access Via Policy?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: Select the publicly accessible S3 bucket that you want to configure (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource) and click the Properties tab from the dashboard top-right menu:
- Step 2: Inside the Properties tab, click Permissions (Open the bucket permissions settings panel).

- Step 3: Click the Edit bucket policy button to access the bucket policy currently in use.

- Step 4: In the Bucket Policy Editor dialog box, perform one of the following actions as required:
  A: To disable entirely the public access to the selected bucket, click the Delete button available inside the policy editor box then select OK to confirm.
  B: To limit the public access to a specific AWS account or AWS IAM user, replace the Principal element current value with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS account ( e.g. { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root" } ) or IAM user ( e.g. { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012: user/David" } ) that should have access to the selected S3 bucket. Once the editing is complete, click Save (Apply the policy changes and update the bucket access permissions).
