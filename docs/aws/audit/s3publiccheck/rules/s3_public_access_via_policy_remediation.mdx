### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the steps to remediate the issue of S3 Buckets allowing public access via policy in AWS:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the S3 service and select the S3 bucket that you want to remediate.
3. Click on the "Permissions" tab.
4. Click on the "Bucket Policy" button.
5. Review the policy to identify any statements that allow public access.
6. Remove or modify the statements that allow public access by editing the policy.
7. Click on the "Save" button to save the updated policy.

Once you have completed these steps, you will have successfully remediated the issue of S3 Buckets allowing public access via policy in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of S3 buckets allowing public access via policy in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. List all the S3 buckets in your AWS account using the following command:

```
aws s3api list-buckets
```

3. Identify the S3 bucket that has public access via policy.

4. Remove the public access policy from the S3 bucket using the following command:

```
aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket BUCKET_NAME --policy ""
```

Replace BUCKET_NAME with the name of the S3 bucket that has the public access policy.

5. Verify that the public access policy has been removed from the S3 bucket using the following command:

```
aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket BUCKET_NAME
```

This command should return an empty policy if the public access policy has been successfully removed.

6. Repeat steps 4-5 for any other S3 buckets that have public access via policy.

7. Monitor your S3 buckets regularly to ensure that they do not have public access via policy.

Note: If you want to allow public access to specific files or folders in your S3 bucket, you can use bucket policies or ACLs to grant public access to those specific resources while keeping the rest of the bucket private.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of S3 buckets allowing public access via policy in AWS using Python, follow the below steps:

1. First, identify the S3 buckets that have public access via policy. You can use the `boto3` library in Python to list all the S3 buckets and check their policies.

```python
import boto3

# Create an S3 client
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# List all S3 buckets
response = s3.list_buckets()

# Check if each bucket has public access via policy
for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    bucket_name = bucket['Name']
    try:
        bucket_policy = s3.get_bucket_policy(Bucket=bucket_name)
        # Check if the policy allows public access
        if 'Effect' in bucket_policy['PolicyDocument']:
            if bucket_policy['PolicyDocument']['Effect'] == 'Allow':
                if 'Principal' in bucket_policy['PolicyDocument']:
                    if bucket_policy['PolicyDocument']['Principal'] == '*':
                        print('Bucket {} allows public access via policy'.format(bucket_name))
    except:
        # The bucket does not have a policy
        pass
```

2. Once you have identified the buckets that have public access via policy, you can update their policies to remove public access. You can use the `put_bucket_policy` method to update the policy of a bucket.

```python
import json

# Create a new policy that denies public access
policy = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

# Convert the policy to a JSON string
policy_str = json.dumps(policy)

# Update the policy of the bucket to deny public access
s3.put_bucket_policy(Bucket='example-bucket', Policy=policy_str)
```

3. After updating the policy of the bucket, you should verify that public access has been removed. You can use the same code as in step 1 to check the policy of the bucket again.

```python
bucket_policy = s3.get_bucket_policy(Bucket='example-bucket')
print(bucket_policy['PolicyDocument'])
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of S3 buckets allowing public access via policy in AWS using Python.
