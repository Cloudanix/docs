### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent S3 Bucket from allowing FULL_CONTROL access to authenticated users using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to S3 Service:**
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - In the Services menu, select "S3" to go to the Amazon S3 dashboard.

2. **Select the Bucket:**
   - In the S3 dashboard, locate and click on the name of the bucket you want to configure.

3. **Access Permissions:**
   - Once inside the bucket, go to the "Permissions" tab.
   - Under the "Permissions" tab, review the "Bucket Policy" and "Access Control List (ACL)" sections.

4. **Modify Bucket Policy and ACL:**
   - **Bucket Policy:** Ensure that the bucket policy does not grant `FULL_CONTROL` to `AuthenticatedUsers`. Edit the policy to remove any such statements.
   - **Access Control List (ACL):** Click on "Edit" in the ACL section and ensure that no ACL grants `FULL_CONTROL` to `AuthenticatedUsers`. Adjust the permissions accordingly and save the changes.

By following these steps, you can prevent the S3 bucket from allowing FULL_CONTROL access to authenticated users.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent S3 buckets from allowing FULL_CONTROL access to authenticated users using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Bucket Policy JSON File**:
   Create a JSON file (e.g., `bucket-policy.json`) with a policy that denies FULL_CONTROL access to authenticated users. Here is an example policy:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Deny",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action": "s3:*",
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
           "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
         ],
         "Condition": {
           "StringEquals": {
             "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control"
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Apply the Bucket Policy**:
   Use the `aws s3api put-bucket-policy` command to apply the policy to your S3 bucket.

   ```sh
   aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket your-bucket-name --policy file://bucket-policy.json
   ```

3. **Verify the Bucket Policy**:
   Use the `aws s3api get-bucket-policy` command to verify that the policy has been applied correctly.

   ```sh
   aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket your-bucket-name
   ```

4. **Check Bucket ACLs**:
   Ensure that the bucket ACLs do not grant FULL_CONTROL to authenticated users. Use the `aws s3api get-bucket-acl` command to check the current ACLs.

   ```sh
   aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket your-bucket-name
   ```

   If necessary, update the ACLs to remove any FULL_CONTROL permissions for authenticated users using the `aws s3api put-bucket-acl` command.

   ```sh
   aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket your-bucket-name --acl private
   ```

By following these steps, you can prevent S3 buckets from allowing FULL_CONTROL access to authenticated users using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent S3 buckets from allowing `FULL_CONTROL` access to authenticated users using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**:
   Initialize the Boto3 client for S3.
   ```python
   import boto3

   s3 = boto3.client('s3')
   ```

3. **Define a Function to Check and Update Bucket Policy**:
   Create a function that checks the bucket policy and updates it to prevent `FULL_CONTROL` access to authenticated users.
   ```python
   import json

   def prevent_full_control_access(bucket_name):
       try:
           # Get the current bucket policy
           result = s3.get_bucket_policy(Bucket=bucket_name)
           policy = json.loads(result['Policy'])
           
           # Iterate through the statements in the policy
           for statement in policy['Statement']:
               if statement['Effect'] == 'Allow' and 'AWS' in statement['Principal']:
                   if 'FULL_CONTROL' in statement['Action']:
                       # Remove FULL_CONTROL access
                       statement['Action'].remove('FULL_CONTROL')
                       
                       # If no actions are left, remove the statement
                       if not statement['Action']:
                           policy['Statement'].remove(statement)
           
           # Update the bucket policy
           s3.put_bucket_policy(Bucket=bucket_name, Policy=json.dumps(policy))
           print(f"Updated policy for bucket: {bucket_name}")
       except s3.exceptions.NoSuchBucketPolicy:
           print(f"No policy found for bucket: {bucket_name}")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Error updating policy for bucket: {bucket_name}, {e}")

   # Example usage
   bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'
   prevent_full_control_access(bucket_name)
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to ensure the bucket policy is updated to prevent `FULL_CONTROL` access to authenticated users.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your S3 buckets do not allow `FULL_CONTROL` access to authenticated users using a Python script.

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.

2. In the Bucket name list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to check for FULL_CONTROL access.

3. Choose the Permissions tab.

4. Under the Access Control List (ACL) section, check the Grantee list. If 'Authenticated Users' is listed with the permission 'FULL_CONTROL', then the bucket is misconfigured as it allows full control access to any authenticated AWS users.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all S3 buckets: Use the following command to list all the S3 buckets in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws s3api list-buckets --query 'Buckets[].Name'
   ```

3. Check bucket policies: For each bucket, you need to check the bucket policy to see if it allows FULL_CONTROL access to authenticated users. You can do this by running the following command for each bucket:

   ```
   aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket bucket-name --query 'Policy'
   ```

   Replace 'bucket-name' with the name of your bucket. This command will return the bucket policy in JSON format.

4. Analyze the bucket policies: Look for any statements in the policy that have 'Effect': 'Allow', 'Principal': '*', and 'Action': 's3:*'. If such a statement exists and the 'Resource' includes the ARN of the bucket or any object within the bucket, then the bucket allows FULL_CONTROL access to authenticated users.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. You can configure it in several ways. The easiest way is to install the AWS CLI, and then configure it with your credentials:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. Write the Python script: The following Python script lists all your S3 buckets and checks if any of them have the FULL_CONTROL permission for authenticated users:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a session using your AWS credentials
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
   )

   # Create an S3 resource object using the session
   s3 = session.resource('s3')

   # Iterate over all your S3 buckets
   for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
       # Get the bucket ACL
       acl = bucket.Acl()
       for grant in acl.grants:
           # Check if the grantee is an authenticated user and has FULL_CONTROL permission
           if grant['Grantee']['Type'] == 'Group' and 'http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers' in grant['Grantee']['URI'] and 'FULL_CONTROL' in grant['Permission']:
               print(f"Bucket {bucket.name} allows FULL_CONTROL access to authenticated users.")
   ```

4. Run the Python script: Save the script to a file, e.g., check_s3_permissions.py, and then run it using Python:

   ```bash
   python check_s3_permissions.py
   ```

   The script will print the names of all S3 buckets that allow FULL_CONTROL access to authenticated users. If no such buckets exist, the script will not print anything.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the issue of an S3 Bucket allowing FULL_CONTROL access to Authenticated Users in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Login to your AWS account and go to the S3 console.
2. Select the bucket for which you want to remediate the issue.
3. Click on the "Permissions" tab in the top navigation bar.
4. Under the "Access control list (ACL)" section, locate the "Authenticated Users" group and select it.
5. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Edit bucket policy".
6. In the bucket policy editor, remove the "FULL_CONTROL" permission from the "Authenticated Users" group.
7. Click on the "Save changes" button to save the updated bucket policy.

After following these steps, the S3 bucket will no longer allow FULL_CONTROL access to Authenticated Users.

#
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to list all the S3 buckets in your account:

   ```
   aws s3api list-buckets
   ```

2. Identify the S3 bucket that is allowing FULL_CONTROL access to authenticated users.

3. Run the following command to remove the FULL_CONTROL access for authenticated users:

   ```
   aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --grant-full-control id=uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers
   ```

   Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of the S3 bucket that you want to remediate.

4. Verify that the FULL_CONTROL access for authenticated users has been removed by running the following command:

   ```
   aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
   ```

   This command will display the access control list (ACL) for the specified S3 bucket. Verify that the authenticated users no longer have FULL_CONTROL access.

5. Repeat the above steps for any other S3 buckets that are allowing FULL_CONTROL access to authenticated users.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration in AWS where S3 bucket is allowing FULL_CONTROL access to authenticated users.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "S3 Bucket Should Not Allow FULL_CONTROL Access to Authenticated Users" in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to identify the S3 buckets that have full control access to authenticated users. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all the S3 buckets and their access control lists (ACLs).

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# List all the S3 buckets
buckets = s3.list_buckets()

# Iterate over the buckets and their ACLs
for bucket in buckets['Buckets']:
    bucket_name = bucket['Name']
    acl = s3.get_bucket_acl(Bucket=bucket_name)
    print(f"Bucket {bucket_name} ACL: {acl}")
```

2. Once you have identified the buckets with full control access to authenticated users, you can update their ACLs to remove the FULL_CONTROL permission for authenticated users. You can use the `put_bucket_acl` method of the S3 client to update the ACL.

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# Update the ACL for the bucket to remove FULL_CONTROL permission for authenticated users
s3.put_bucket_acl(
    Bucket='my-bucket',
    GrantFullControl='',
    GrantRead='',
    GrantWrite='',
    GrantReadACP='',
    GrantWriteACP='',
    AccessControlPolicy={
        'Grants': [
            {
                'Grantee': {
                    'Type': 'Group',
                    'URI': 'http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers'
                },
                'Permission': 'READ'
            },
            {
                'Grantee': {
                    'Type': 'Group',
                    'URI': 'http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers'
                },
                'Permission': 'WRITE'
            },
            {
                'Grantee': {
                    'Type': 'Group',
                    'URI': 'http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers'
                },
                'Permission': 'READ_ACP'
            },
            {
                'Grantee': {
                    'Type': 'Group',
                    'URI': 'http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers'
                },
                'Permission': 'WRITE_ACP'
            }
        ],
        'Owner': {
            'DisplayName': 'string',
            'ID': 'string'
        }
    }
)
```

This will remove the FULL_CONTROL permission for authenticated users from the ACL of the specified bucket. You can repeat this step for all the buckets that have full control access to authenticated users.
