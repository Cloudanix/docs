How to enable object lock for S3 buckets?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
2. Click on the name of the existing S3 bucket for which you want to enable Object Lock.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Buckets Should Have Object Lock Enabled" Policy.)
3. In the bucket details page, click on the "Properties" tab.
4. Under the "Advanced settings" section, locate the "Object Lock" option and click on the "Edit" button.
5. In the "Object Lock" window, select the "Enable object lock" option.
6. Choose the desired retention mode for the Object Lock:
   - "Governance" mode allows users with specific permissions to override or delete locked objects before the retention period expires.
   - "Compliance" mode ensures that locked objects cannot be deleted or modified by anyone until the retention period expires.
7. Select the retention period for the locked objects:
   - Choose the number of days or specify a specific date until which the objects will be locked.
8. Click on the "Save changes" button to enable Object Lock on the bucket.
9. Once Object Lock is enabled, the bucket will be protected from deletion or modification of locked objects based on the retention mode and period defined.
10. Upload or modify objects in the bucket to test the Object Lock functionality. Locked objects cannot be deleted or modified until the retention period expires or if you have the appropriate permissions in the governance mode.
