### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.

2. In the Buckets list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to check for Object Lock configuration.

3. In the Properties tab of the selected bucket, scroll down to the Object Lock section. If the Object Lock is not enabled, it will show "Object Lock is not enabled for this bucket".

4. For further confirmation, you can also check the bucket's permissions settings. Under the Permissions tab, check the bucket policy or ACLs for any permissions that allow public access. If there are any such permissions, it indicates that the bucket's objects may not be adequately protected by Object Lock.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all S3 buckets: Use the following command to list all the S3 buckets in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws s3api list-buckets --query "Buckets[].Name"
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the S3 bucket names.

3. Check Object Lock configuration for each bucket: For each bucket, you can check if Object Lock is enabled by using the following command:

   ```
   aws s3api get-object-lock-configuration --bucket <bucket-name>
   ```
   Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of your bucket. If Object Lock is enabled, this command will return the Object Lock configuration details. If it's not enabled, the command will return an error.

4. Analyze the results: If the `get-object-lock-configuration` command returns an error for a bucket, it means that Object Lock is not enabled for that bucket. You should enable Object Lock for all your S3 buckets to prevent accidental deletion of objects.

#### Using Python

1. First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Create an S3 client and retrieve a list of all your S3 buckets:

```python
s3 = session.client('s3')
response = s3.list_buckets()

buckets = [bucket['Name'] for bucket in response['Buckets']]
```

4. For each bucket, check if Object Lock is enabled:

```python
for bucket in buckets:
    try:
        response = s3.get_object_lock_configuration(Bucket=bucket)
        if 'ObjectLockConfiguration' in response:
            print(f'Object Lock is enabled for bucket: {bucket}')
        else:
            print(f'Object Lock is not enabled for bucket: {bucket}')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'Error checking Object Lock for bucket: {bucket}. Error: {str(e)}')
```

This script will print out whether Object Lock is enabled for each of your S3 buckets. If Object Lock is not enabled for a bucket, it may be a misconfiguration depending on your use case.
