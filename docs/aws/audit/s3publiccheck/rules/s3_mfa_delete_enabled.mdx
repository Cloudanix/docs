How to enable MFA delete for S3 bucket?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
2. Click on the name of the existing S3 bucket for which you want to enable MFA Delete.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Bucket Should Have MFA Delete Enabled" Policy.)
3. In the bucket details page, click on the "Properties" tab.
4. Under the "Advanced settings" section, locate the "Versioning" option and click on the "Edit" button.
5. In the "Versioning" window, ensure that versioning is already enabled for the bucket. MFA Delete requires versioning to be enabled.
6. If versioning is not already enabled, follow the instructions to enable versioning first. Once versioning is enabled, proceed to the next step.
7. Under the "Advanced settings" section, locate the "MFA Delete" option and click on the "Edit" button.
8. In the "MFA Delete" window, select the checkbox for "Enable MFA Delete".
9. Choose the MFA device that will be required for delete operations on the bucket. You can select an existing MFA device or create a new one.
10. Click on the "Save changes" button to enable MFA Delete on the bucket.
11. Once MFA Delete is enabled, any delete operations on the bucket will require MFA authentication.
12. You may need to configure your IAM policies and permissions to allow users or roles to perform delete operations with the necessary MFA authentication.
13. Test the MFA Delete functionality by attempting to delete an object from the bucket. You should be prompted to provide MFA authentication before the delete operation is completed.
