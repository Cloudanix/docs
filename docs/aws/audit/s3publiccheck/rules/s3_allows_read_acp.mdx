### More Info:

AWS S3 buckets should not allow public READ_ACP access. Granting public “READ_ACP” access to your S3 buckets can allow everyone on the Internet to see who controls your objects. Malicious users can use this information to find S3 objects with misconfigured permissions and implement probing techniques to help them gain access to your S3 data.

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.

2. In the Bucket name list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to check for public READ_ACP access.

3. Choose the Permissions tab, and then choose Access Control List.

4. Under the Public access section, check if Everyone or Any authenticated AWS user has the READ_ACP permission enabled. If it's enabled, then the bucket allows public READ_ACP access.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```

   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all S3 buckets: Use the following command to list all the S3 buckets in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws s3api list-buckets --query "Buckets[].Name"
   ```

3. Check bucket policy: For each bucket, check the bucket policy to see if it allows public READ_ACP access. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
   ```

   Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of your bucket.

4. Analyze the output: The command will return a JSON object that contains the bucket's Access Control List (ACL). Look for any grants where the Grantee is `AllUsers` or `AuthenticatedUsers` and the Permission is `READ_ACP`. If such grants exist, then the bucket allows public READ_ACP access.

#### Using Python

1. First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and establish a session with AWS using your credentials:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Create a client for S3 and retrieve all the buckets:

```python
s3 = session.client('s3')
response = s3.list_buckets()

buckets = [bucket['Name'] for bucket in response['Buckets']]
```

4. Now, for each bucket, check the Access Control Policy (ACP) to see if it allows public READ_ACP access:

```python
for bucket in buckets:
    bucket_acp = s3.get_bucket_acl(Bucket=bucket)
    for grant in bucket_acp['Grants']:
        if 'AllUsers' in grant['Grantee']['URI']:
            if grant['Permission'] == 'READ_ACP':
                print(f"Bucket {bucket} allows public READ_ACP access")
```

This script will print out the names of all buckets that allow public READ_ACP access. If no such buckets exist, it will not print anything.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "S3 Bucket Should Not Allow Public READ_ACP Access" for AWS using AWS console:

1. Log in to your AWS console.
2. Navigate to the S3 service.
3. Select the S3 bucket that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Permissions" tab.
5. Scroll down to the "Access control list (ACL)" section.
6. Click on the "Edit" button next to the "Public access" option.
7. Uncheck the "List objects" checkbox under the "Access for Everyone" section.
8. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

By following the above steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "S3 Bucket Should Not Allow Public READ_ACP Access" for AWS using AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "S3 Bucket Should Not Allow Public READ_ACP Access" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

Step 2: Run the following command to list all the S3 buckets in your AWS account.

```
aws s3api list-buckets
```

Step 3: Identify the bucket that has public READ_ACP access and note down the bucket name.

Step 4: Run the following command to remove the public READ_ACP access from the identified S3 bucket.

```
aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private
```

Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of the identified S3 bucket.

Step 5: Verify that the public READ_ACP access has been removed from the S3 bucket by running the following command.

```
aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
```

This command will return the access control list (ACL) of the S3 bucket. Ensure that there are no grants with the permission "READ_ACP" for "AllUsers" or "AuthenticatedUsers".

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "S3 Bucket Should Not Allow Public READ_ACP Access" in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the S3 Bucket should not allow public READ_ACP access issue in AWS, you can follow the below steps using Python:

1. Import the required AWS SDKs and libraries in your Python script.

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Initialize the S3 client using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and provide the necessary AWS credentials.

```python
s3 = boto3.client('s3',
    aws_access_key_id='<your_access_key_id>',
    aws_secret_access_key='<your_secret_access_key>'
)
```

3. Iterate over all the S3 buckets in your AWS account and check if any of them have public READ_ACP access.

```python
buckets = s3.list_buckets()['Buckets']

for bucket in buckets:
    try:
        acl = s3.get_bucket_acl(Bucket=bucket['Name'])
        grants = acl['Grants']
        
        for grant in grants:
            if 'URI' in grant['Grantee'] and grant['Permission'] == 'READ_ACP':
                print(f"Bucket {bucket['Name']} has public READ_ACP access.")
                # remediation steps go here
                break
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error getting ACL for bucket {bucket['Name']}: {e}")
```

4. If any S3 bucket has public READ_ACP access, update its bucket policy to deny public READ_ACP access.

```python
bucket_policy = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObjectAcl",
            "Resource": f"arn:aws:s3:::{bucket['Name']}/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "s3:x-amz-acl": "public-read"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

s3.put_bucket_policy(Bucket=bucket['Name'], Policy=json.dumps(bucket_policy))
```

This will update the bucket policy for the S3 bucket to deny public READ_ACP access.
