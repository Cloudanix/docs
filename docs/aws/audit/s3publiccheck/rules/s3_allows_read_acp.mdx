### More Info:

AWS S3 buckets should not allow public READ_ACP access. Granting public “READ_ACP” access to your S3 buckets can allow everyone on the Internet to see who controls your objects. Malicious users can use this information to find S3 objects with misconfigured permissions and implement probing techniques to help them gain access to your S3 data.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

PCIDSS, NIST

### Remediation

How to ensure that your S3 bucket content permissions cannot be viewed by AWS authenticated accounts or IAM users?
