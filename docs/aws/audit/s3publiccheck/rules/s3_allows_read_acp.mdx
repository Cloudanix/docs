title: S3 Bucket Should Not Allow Public READ_ACP Access
---

### More Info:

AWS S3 buckets should not allow public READ_ACP access. Granting public "READ_ACP" access to your S3 buckets can allow everyone on the Internet to see who controls your objects. Malicious users can use this information to find S3 objects with misconfigured permissions and implement probing techniques to help them gain access to your S3 data.

### Remediation

How to ensure that your S3 bucket content permissions cannot be viewed by AWS authenticated accounts or IAM users?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the Amazon S3 console by navigating to the "Services" menu and selecting "S3" under the "Storage" section.
3. Select the bucket for which you want to manage access permissions.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Bucket Should Not Allow READ_ACP Access For Authenticated Users" Policy.)
4. Click on the "Permissions" tab in the bucket details.
5. In the "Access control list (ACL)" section, review the permissions granted to various entities such as "Authenticated Users" group, "All Users" group, and specific IAM users.
   - Make sure that the permissions do not include the `READ_ACP` action for any of these entities.
   - If you find any such permissions, select them and click on the "Remove" button to revoke the permissions.
6. In the "Bucket policy" section, review the bucket policy to ensure that there are no statements granting the `s3:GetBucketAcl` or `s3:GetObjectAcl` actions to any entities that include the `Principal` or `AWS` field with values representing unauthorized users or entities.
   - If you find any such statements, edit the bucket policy and remove or modify them accordingly to disallow the `READ_ACP` permissions.
   For example, the following statement grants `READ_ACP` permission to all users:
   ```
   "Statement": [
       {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": "*",
           "Action": [
               "s3:GetBucketAcl",
               "s3:GetObjectAcl"
           ],
           "Resource": [
               "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
               "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
           ]
       }
   ]
   ```
7. In the "Access control list (ACL)" and "Bucket policy" sections, make sure that the appropriate permissions are granted to the desired principals or groups for authorized access, while ensuring that the `READ_ACP` permission is not allowed.
8. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.
