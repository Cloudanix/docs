### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.

2. In the Bucket name list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to check for public access.

3. Choose the Permissions tab. Under the "Block public access" section, you can see the current public access settings for the selected bucket.

4. If "Block all public access" is set to Off, it means that the bucket might have some form of public access. Further, under the Access Control List (ACL) tab, check if "Everyone" or "Any authenticated AWS user" has READ access. If they do, then the bucket allows public READ access.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all S3 buckets: Use the following command to list all the S3 buckets in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws s3api list-buckets --query 'Buckets[].Name'
   ```

3. Check bucket policy: For each bucket, you need to check the bucket policy to see if it allows public READ access. You can do this by running the following command for each bucket.

   ```
   aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket your-bucket-name
   ```

4. Analyze the output: The output of the above command will be a JSON object that represents the bucket policy. You need to analyze this JSON object to see if it contains a statement that allows public READ access. If the "Effect" field is set to "Allow" and the "Principal" field is set to "*", then the bucket allows public READ access.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the Boto3 library. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials: Before you can interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a file at ~/.aws/credentials. At the very least, the contents of the file should be:

   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check S3 bucket permissions: The following script will list all S3 buckets in your account and check if they allow public READ access.

   ```python
   import boto3

   s3 = boto3.client('s3')

   # List all S3 buckets
   buckets = s3.list_buckets()
   for bucket in buckets['Buckets']:
       # Get bucket policy
       policy = s3.get_bucket_policy(Bucket=bucket['Name'])
       # Check if policy allows public read access
       if '"Effect": "Allow", "Principal": "*"' in policy['Policy']:
           print(f'Bucket {bucket["Name"]} allows public READ access')
   ```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using the Python interpreter. The script will print the names of all S3 buckets that allow public READ access.

   ```
   python check_s3_permissions.py
   ```

Please note that this script only checks for explicit Allow statements for all principals. It does not check for other ways that a bucket could be publicly accessible, such as through an associated IAM role.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the step by step instructions to remediate the issue "S3 Buckets Should Not Allow Public READ Access" in AWS:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the S3 service.
3. Select the bucket that has public READ access.
4. Click on the Permissions tab.
5. Under the Public access settings, click on Edit.
6. Uncheck the box that says "List objects" and "View object permissions" for "Everyone", "Authenticated users" and "Log delivery group".
7. Click on Save changes.

After following these steps, your S3 bucket will no longer allow public READ access.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of S3 buckets allowing public READ access in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine and run the following command to list all the S3 buckets in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws s3api list-buckets
   ```

2. Identify the S3 bucket(s) that have public READ access.

3. Run the following command to remove public READ access from the identified S3 bucket(s):

   ```
   aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --acl private
   ```

   Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of the identified S3 bucket.

4. Verify that public READ access has been removed from the S3 bucket(s) by running the following command:

   ```
   aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
   ```

   Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of the identified S3 bucket.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the S3 buckets that have public READ access.

6. Once all the S3 buckets have been remediated, ensure that you have a process in place to regularly monitor your S3 buckets for public READ access and remediate any misconfigurations promptly.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of S3 Buckets allowing public READ access in AWS using python, follow these steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) using pip:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Create an AWS S3 client using boto3:

```
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
```

3. List all S3 buckets in your AWS account using the `list_buckets()` method:

```
response = s3.list_buckets()

for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    print(f'Bucket Name: {bucket["Name"]}')
```

4. For each S3 bucket, check if it has any public READ access by using the `get_bucket_acl()` method:

```
response = s3.get_bucket_acl(Bucket='bucket-name')

for grant in response['Grants']:
    if 'URI' in grant['Grantee'] and grant['Permission'] == 'READ':
        print('Public READ access found')
```

5. If public READ access is found, remove it by using the `put_bucket_acl()` method:

```
response = s3.put_bucket_acl(
    Bucket='bucket-name',
    ACL='private'
)

print('Public READ access removed')
```

6. Repeat steps 4-5 for all S3 buckets in your AWS account.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of S3 Buckets allowing public READ access in AWS using python.
