### Remediation

How to enable Server Side Encryption for S3 Bucket?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "S3 Buckets Should Enforce Server Side Encryption" Policy.)
2. Navigate to the S3 service by selecting "S3" from the services menu.
3. In the S3 dashboard, locate the bucket for which server-side encryption is not enabled.
4. Click on the bucket name to access the bucket's configuration settings.
5. In the bucket properties, select the "Properties" tab.
6. Scroll down to the "Default encryption" section.
7. Click on the "Edit" button next to "Default encryption" to modify the encryption settings.
8. In the "Edit default encryption configuration" dialog box, select the desired encryption option.
   - SSE-S3: Choose this option if you want AWS S3 to automatically encrypt objects using S3-managed keys.
   - SSE-KMS: Choose this option if you want AWS S3 to automatically encrypt objects using keys managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
   - SSE-C: Choose this option if you want to provide your own encryption keys (customer-provided keys).
9. Select the appropriate encryption option and click on the "Save" button to enable server-side encryption for the bucket.
10. Once saved, the bucket will have server-side encryption enabled, and any new objects uploaded to the bucket will be automatically encrypted using the chosen encryption method.
11. Review the bucket's encryption settings to ensure that server-side encryption is now enabled.
