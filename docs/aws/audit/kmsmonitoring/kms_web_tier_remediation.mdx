How to create Amazon KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) in your AWS account for the web tier?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: Sign in to your Cloud Conformity console, access Web Tier Customer Master Key In Use conformity rule settings and copy the tag set defined for your web tier resources (e.g. <web_tier_tag>:<web_tier_tag_value>).

- Step 2: Inside AWS management console, Navigate to KMS dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms/.

- Step 3: In the left navigation panel, click Encryption Keys. Select the appropriate AWS region from the Filter menu:
  (must match the region where the AWS web tier resources have been provisioned).

- Step 4: Click Create Key button from the dashboard top menu to initiate the setup process.

- Step 5: On Create Alias and Description page, type the key name into the Alias (required) box and enter a short description in the Description box. Click Next Step to continue.

- Step 6: On Add Tags page, create tags to organize the identity of the new key (i.e. web-tier encryption key). Use the given format when you define your own tag set: <web_tier_tag>:<web_tier_tag_value> and make sure the tag name (<web_tier_tag>) and the tag value (<web_tier_tag_value>) match the tag set used to organize your web-tier resources. Click Next Step to continue the setup process.

- Step 7: On Define Key Administrative Permissions page, select which IAM users and/or roles can administer the new CMK, then click Next Step.

- Step 8: On Define Key Usage Permissions page, select which IAM users and/or roles can use the key to encrypt/decrypt data with the AWS KMS API. (Optional) Under External Accounts section, click Add an External Account and enter an external account ID in order to add another AWS account that can use this CMK to encrypt/decrypt data. The owners of the external AWS accounts must also provide access to this CMK by creating policies for their IAM users. Click Next Step to continue.

- Step 9: On Preview Key Policy page, review the predefined access policy then click Finish to create your own web-tier Customer Master Key (CMK). Once the key is successfully created, the KMS service dashboard will display the following confirmation message: “Your master key was created successfully. Alias: <web_tier_tag_value>”
