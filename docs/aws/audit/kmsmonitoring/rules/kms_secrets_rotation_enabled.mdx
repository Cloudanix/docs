### More Info:

Ensure that AWS Secrets Manager service is configured to automatically rotate your service or database secrets (i.e. enable automatic rotation feature for your secrets). Secrets Manager rotation is the automatic process that periodically change your secrets data to make it more difficult for an attacker to access the services and resources secured with these secrets. With Amazon Secrets Manager you don't have to manually change the secret and update it on all of your clients. Instead, the Secrets Manager service uses an AWS Lambda function to perform for you all of the steps required for rotation, on a regular schedule (predefined or custom).
