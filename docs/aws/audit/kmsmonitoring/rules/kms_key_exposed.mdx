### More Info:

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the KMS dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, click on "Customer managed keys". This will display a list of all the KMS keys that are currently available within your AWS account.
3. For each key listed, click on its alias to access the key configuration details.
4. In the key configuration details page, check the "Key policy" section. If the "Effect" is set to "Allow" and the "Principal" is set to "*" (which means everyone), then the KMS key is exposed.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all KMS keys: Use the `list-keys` command to retrieve all the KMS keys in your account. This command returns the key ID and ARN for each key in your account.

   ```
   aws kms list-keys
   ```
3. Describe each key: For each key returned by the `list-keys` command, use the `describe-key` command to get more information about the key. This command returns the key's metadata, including its ARN, creation date, enabled status, key usage, and key state.

   ```
   aws kms describe-key --key-id <key-id>
   ```
4. Check the key policy: The key policy determines who can use the key and what actions they can perform. Use the `get-key-policy` command to retrieve the policy for each key. If the policy allows the `*` principal or allows actions from outside your account, the key is exposed.

   ```
   aws kms get-key-policy --key-id <key-id> --policy-name default
   ```
   You will need to manually inspect the returned policy to check for exposure. If the "Principal" field is set to "*", or if there are any statements with "Effect": "Allow" and "Principal": {"AWS": "*"}, then the key is exposed.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. For AWS, you will need the boto3 library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the client: After installing the necessary libraries, you need to import them into your script and initialize the AWS client.

```python
import boto3

# Create a client
client = boto3.client('kms')
```

3. List all KMS keys: You can use the `list_keys` function to get a list of all KMS keys in your AWS account.

```python
# List all KMS keys
response = client.list_keys()

keys = response['Keys']
```

4. Check if KMS keys are exposed: For each key in the list, you can use the `get_key_policy` function to get the policy of the key. If the policy allows access to the key from outside of your AWS account, then the key is exposed.

```python
for key in keys:
    policy = client.get_key_policy(KeyId=key['KeyId'], PolicyName='default')
    
    # Check if the policy allows access from outside of your AWS account
    if 'Statement' in policy:
        for statement in policy['Statement']:
            if 'Principal' in statement and statement['Principal'] == '*':
                print(f"KMS key {key['KeyId']} is exposed")
```

This script will print out the IDs of all KMS keys that are exposed.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the AWS KMS console.
3. Click on the "Aliases" tab.
4. Select the KMS key that is exposed.
5. Click on the "Key Policy" button.
6. Review the Key Policy to ensure that it is not exposing the KMS key.
7. If the Key Policy is exposing the KMS key, click on the "Edit" button.
8. Update the Key Policy to remove any permissions that expose the KMS key.
9. Click on the "Review and Save" button.
10. Review the changes made to the Key Policy.
11. Click on the "Save Changes" button to save the updated Key Policy.

Once you have completed these steps, the KMS key will no longer be exposed and the misconfiguration will be remediated.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of KMS Keys being exposed in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. List all the KMS keys in your AWS account by running the following command:
```
aws kms list-keys
```

2. Identify the KMS key(s) that are exposed and note down their Key IDs.

3. Remove the Key Policy from the KMS key(s) by running the following command:
```
aws kms put-key-policy --key-id <key-id> --policy-name default --policy "{}"
```
Replace `<key-id>` with the Key ID of the KMS key that you want to remediate.

4. Verify that the Key Policy has been removed by running the following command:
```
aws kms get-key-policy --key-id <key-id> --policy-name default
```
Replace `<key-id>` with the Key ID of the KMS key that you remediated. This command should return an empty policy.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the exposed KMS keys in your AWS account.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the issue of KMS Keys being exposed in AWS.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of KMS Keys being exposed in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Identify the KMS keys that are exposed.

You can use the AWS CLI command `aws kms list-keys` to list all the KMS keys in your AWS account. Then, you can use the `aws kms describe-key` command to get the details of each key and check if any of them are exposed.

Step 2: Revoke the key policy that is exposing the KMS key.

You can use the `aws kms put-key-policy` command to revoke the key policy that is exposing the KMS key. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```python
import boto3

# Create a KMS client
kms = boto3.client('kms')

# Specify the key ID and the policy name
key_id = 'your_key_id'
policy_name = 'your_policy_name'

# Get the current key policy
key_policy = kms.get_key_policy(KeyId=key_id, PolicyName=policy_name)

# Revoke the key policy
key_policy['Policy'] = '{"Statement": []}'
kms.put_key_policy(KeyId=key_id, PolicyName=policy_name, Policy=json.dumps(key_policy['Policy']))
```

Step 3: Monitor the KMS keys to ensure they are not exposed again.

You can set up CloudWatch alarms to monitor the KMS keys and get notified if any of them are exposed again. You can also use AWS Config to monitor the KMS keys and get notified if any of the key policies are changed.
