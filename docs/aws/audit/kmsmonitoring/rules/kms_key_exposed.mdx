How to ensure that any publicly accessible AWS Key Management Service master keys are not identified?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) by selecting "KMS" from the services menu.
3. In the KMS dashboard, click on "Customer managed keys" in the left navigation pane.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "KMS Keys Should Not Be Exposed" Policy.)
4. Identify the KMS keys that are publicly accessible.
5. Take note of the specific key identifier(s) that need remediation.
6. Select the checkbox next to the key(s) you want to remediate.
7. Above the list of keys, click on the "Edit key policy" button.
8. In the "Edit key policy" page, review the existing key policy for the selected key(s).
9. Modify the key policy to remove any permissions that grant public access.
   - Identify the "Statement" section in the key policy that allows public access.
   - Select and delete the statement(s) that grant access to the "Principal" value of "*".
10. Ensure that the remaining statements provide appropriate permissions to authorized AWS identities or roles.
11. Once the key policy is updated, click on the "Save changes" button to apply the modified policy.
12. Monitor the status of the key policy update to ensure it is successfully applied to the KMS keys.
13. Repeat these steps for each KMS key that is publicly accessible until all keys have been remediated.
