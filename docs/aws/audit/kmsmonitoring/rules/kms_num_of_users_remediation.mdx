### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of having too many KMS (Key Management Service) admins in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Review Existing Key Policies:**
   - Navigate to the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the KMS service by searching for "KMS" in the search bar.
   - Select the key you want to review.
   - Click on the "Key Policy" tab to view the current key policy.
   - Ensure that the policy is not overly permissive and does not grant administrative privileges to too many users or roles.

2. **Limit Administrative Access:**
   - Edit the key policy to restrict administrative access.
   - Click on the "Edit" button in the Key Policy tab.
   - Remove any unnecessary users, roles, or groups that have administrative permissions.
   - Ensure that only a minimal number of trusted administrators have the `kms:PutKeyPolicy` and `kms:UpdateKeyDescription` permissions.

3. **Use IAM Policies for Additional Control:**
   - Navigate to the IAM service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Review the IAM policies attached to users, groups, and roles that have access to KMS.
   - Ensure that IAM policies do not grant broad administrative permissions to KMS keys.
   - Use least privilege principles to limit permissions to only what is necessary.

4. **Enable CloudTrail for Monitoring:**
   - Navigate to the CloudTrail service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Ensure that CloudTrail is enabled to log all KMS API calls.
   - Regularly review CloudTrail logs to monitor any changes to key policies and identify any unauthorized access or modifications.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the number of KMS admins is limited and that key policies are designed with the principle of least privilege in mind.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of having too many KMS (Key Management Service) admins in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS CLI:

1. **List Current Key Policies:**
   First, identify the current key policies associated with your KMS keys to understand who has administrative permissions.
   ```sh
   aws kms list-keys
   aws kms get-key-policy --key-id <key-id> --policy-name default
   ```

2. **Create a New Key Policy:**
   Design a new key policy that limits the number of KMS admins. Save this policy in a JSON file (e.g., `new-key-policy.json`). Ensure that only the necessary IAM users or roles are included as admins.
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Id": "key-default-1",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "Allow administration of the key",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": [
             "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/AdminUser1",
             "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AdminRole1"
           ]
         },
         "Action": [
           "kms:Create*",
           "kms:Describe*",
           "kms:Enable*",
           "kms:List*",
           "kms:Put*",
           "kms:Update*",
           "kms:Revoke*",
           "kms:Disable*",
           "kms:Get*",
           "kms:Delete*",
           "kms:TagResource",
           "kms:UntagResource",
           "kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion",
           "kms:CancelKeyDeletion"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Apply the New Key Policy:**
   Use the AWS CLI to apply the new key policy to your KMS key.
   ```sh
   aws kms put-key-policy --key-id <key-id> --policy-name default --policy file://new-key-policy.json
   ```

4. **Verify the New Key Policy:**
   Confirm that the new key policy has been applied correctly by retrieving and reviewing the key policy.
   ```sh
   aws kms get-key-policy --key-id <key-id> --policy-name default
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that the number of KMS admins is limited to only those who absolutely need administrative access, thereby reducing the risk of misconfigurations and enhancing the security of your KMS keys.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of having too many KMS (Key Management Service) admins in AWS, you can use Python scripts to manage and limit the number of KMS admins. Below are the steps to achieve this:

### Step 1: Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)
First, ensure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### Step 2: Define the KMS Key Policy
Create a JSON policy that limits the number of KMS admins. This policy should be designed to grant administrative permissions to a minimal set of users or roles.

```python
import json

key_policy = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "key-default-1",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:root"},
            "Action": "kms:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Limit KMS Admins",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:user/AdminUser1",
                    "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/AdminRole1"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "kms:Create*",
                "kms:Describe*",
                "kms:Enable*",
                "kms:List*",
                "kms:Put*",
                "kms:Update*",
                "kms:Revoke*",
                "kms:Disable*",
                "kms:Get*",
                "kms:Delete*",
                "kms:TagResource",
                "kms:UntagResource",
                "kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion",
                "kms:CancelKeyDeletion"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Step 3: Apply the Key Policy to a KMS Key
Use Boto3 to apply this policy to a specific KMS key. Replace `ACCOUNT_ID` and `KEY_ID` with your actual AWS account ID and KMS key ID.

```python
import boto3

# Initialize a session using Amazon KMS
kms_client = boto3.client('kms')

# Replace with your actual KMS key ID
key_id = 'YOUR_KMS_KEY_ID'

# Convert the policy to a JSON string
key_policy_json = json.dumps(key_policy)

# Apply the key policy
response = kms_client.put_key_policy(
    KeyId=key_id,
    PolicyName='default',
    Policy=key_policy_json
)

print(response)
```

### Step 4: Verify the Key Policy
After applying the policy, you should verify that it has been correctly applied and that only the specified users or roles have administrative permissions.

```python
# Retrieve the key policy to verify
response = kms_client.get_key_policy(
    KeyId=key_id,
    PolicyName='default'
)

# Print the key policy
print(response['Policy'])
```

### Summary
1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)**: Ensure Boto3 is installed.
2. **Define the KMS Key Policy**: Create a JSON policy that limits the number of KMS admins.
3. **Apply the Key Policy to a KMS Key**: Use Boto3 to apply the policy to a specific KMS key.
4. **Verify the Key Policy**: Retrieve and verify the key policy to ensure it has been correctly applied.

By following these steps, you can effectively limit the number of KMS admins and prevent misconfigurations using Python scripts.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.

2. To use the AWS KMS console, you must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user (not recommended) in your AWS account.

3. In the navigation pane, choose "Customer managed keys".

4. Choose the alias or key ID of the KMS key to review.

5. Under Key policy, review the policy for the key. Look for the "Sid": "Allow access for Key Administrators" section. This section lists the IAM users and roles that have administrative permissions for the key. If there are more administrators than necessary, it indicates a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. **List all KMS Keys**: Use the `list-keys` command to get a list of all KMS keys in your AWS account. The command is as follows:

    ```
    aws kms list-keys
    ```

    This command will return a list of all KMS keys along with their KeyId and Arn.

3. **Describe Key Policy**: For each KeyId returned in the previous step, use the `get-key-policy` command to get the policy of the key. The command is as follows:

    ```
    aws kms get-key-policy --key-id <key-id> --policy-name default
    ```

    Replace `<key-id>` with the KeyId of the key. This command will return the policy of the key in JSON format.

4. **Check Number of KMS Admins**: Parse the JSON output of the previous command to check the number of KMS admins. The policy JSON contains a statement array, and each statement has a Principal field which specifies the IAM users and roles that are granted permissions. If the Principal field contains more than the desired number of IAM users or roles, then the KMS key policy is not designed to limit the number of KMS admins. You can use a tool like `jq` to parse the JSON output in the command line, or you can use a programming language like Python to parse the JSON output.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Import the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) modules and initialize a new KMS client:

```python
import boto3
kms_client = boto3.client('kms')
```

2. Retrieve all the KMS keys in your AWS account:

```python
response = kms_client.list_keys()
kms_keys = response['Keys']
```

3. For each KMS key, retrieve the key policy and parse it to check the number of admins:

```python
for key in kms_keys:
    key_id = key['KeyId']
    policy = kms_client.get_key_policy(KeyId=key_id, PolicyName='default')
```

4. Parse the policy and count the number of admins. If the number of admins is more than a certain threshold (e.g., 2), print a warning message:

```python
import json
policy_document = json.loads(policy['Policy'])
admin_count = 0
for statement in policy_document['Statement']:
    if 'kms:Create*' in statement['Action'] or 'kms:Describe*' in statement['Action']:
        admin_count += 1
if admin_count > 2:
    print(f"Warning: KMS key {key_id} has too many admins ({admin_count}).")
```

This script will print a warning for each KMS key that has more than 2 admins. You can adjust the threshold as per your organization's requirements.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this issue for AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the KMS key ID that needs to be remediated.

2. Create a new IAM policy that grants the required permissions for KMS key management.

3. Attach the new IAM policy to an IAM user or role that needs to manage the KMS key.

4. Remove the KMS key administrator permissions from the existing IAM users or roles.

Here are the detailed steps:

Step 1: Identify the KMS key ID that needs to be remediated

Use the following command to list all the KMS keys in your AWS account:

```
aws kms list-keys
```

Identify the KMS key ID that needs to be remediated.

Step 2: Create a new IAM policy that grants the required permissions for KMS key management

Create a new IAM policy that grants the required permissions for KMS key management. Here's an example of a policy that allows a user to manage a specific KMS key:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowKeyManagement",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Create*",
                "kms:Describe*",
                "kms:Enable*",
                "kms:List*",
                "kms:Put*",
                "kms:Update*",
                "kms:Revoke*",
                "kms:Disable*",
                "kms:Get*",
                "kms:Delete*",
                "kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion",
                "kms:CancelKeyDeletion"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
        }
    ]
}
```

Replace the KMS key ARN with the ARN of the KMS key that needs to be managed.

Step 3: Attach the new IAM policy to an IAM user or role that needs to manage the KMS key

Use the following command to attach the new IAM policy to an IAM user or role:

```
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <user-name> --policy-arn <policy-arn>
```

Replace `<user-name>` with the name of the IAM user or role that needs to manage the KMS key, and `<policy-arn>` with the ARN of the new IAM policy.

Step 4: Remove the KMS key administrator permissions from the existing IAM users or roles

Use the following command to remove the KMS key administrator permissions from the existing IAM users or roles:

```
aws kms revoke-grant --key-id <key-id> --grant-id <grant-id>
```

Replace `<key-id>` with the ID of the KMS key, and `<grant-id>` with the ID of the grant that needs to be revoked.

Repeat this command for each grant that needs to be revoked.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of KMS key policies that should be designed to limit the number of KMS admins for AWS.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to identify the KMS keys that have overly permissive key policies. You can use the `boto3` library in Python to list all the KMS keys and their key policies.

```python
import boto3

# Create a KMS client
kms = boto3.client('kms')

# List all the KMS keys
response = kms.list_keys()

# Loop through each key and print its key policy
for key in response['Keys']:
    key_id = key['KeyId']
    key_policy = kms.get_key_policy(KeyId=key_id, PolicyName='default')['Policy']
    print(f"Key ID: {key_id} \nKey Policy: {key_policy}")
```

2. Once you have identified the KMS keys with overly permissive key policies, you need to update their policies to limit the number of KMS admins. You can use the `put_key_policy` method to update the key policy.

```python
import json

# Define the new key policy
new_policy = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "key-policy-1",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Admin1",
                    "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Admin2"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "kms:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Allow use of the key",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Encrypt",
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:ReEncrypt*",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
                "kms:DescribeKey"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

# Update the key policy for a specific KMS key
response = kms.put_key_policy(
    KeyId='1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab',
    PolicyName='default',
    Policy=json.dumps(new_policy)
)
```

In the above code, you need to replace the `KeyId` with the ID of the KMS key that you want to update, and replace the `AWS` ARNs with the ARNs of the IAM users who should have KMS admin permissions.

3. Repeat step 2 for all the KMS keys with overly permissive key policies.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of KMS key policies being designed to limit the number of KMS admins in AWS using Python.
