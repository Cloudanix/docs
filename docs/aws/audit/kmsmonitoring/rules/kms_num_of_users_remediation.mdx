1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.

2. To use the AWS KMS console, you must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user (not recommended) in your AWS account.

3. In the navigation pane, choose "Customer managed keys".

4. Choose the alias or key ID of the KMS key to review.

5. Under Key policy, review the policy for the key. Look for the "Sid": "Allow access for Key Administrators" section. This section lists the IAM users and roles that have administrative permissions for the key. If there are more administrators than necessary, it indicates a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. **List all KMS Keys**: Use the `list-keys` command to get a list of all KMS keys in your AWS account. The command is as follows:

    ```
    aws kms list-keys
    ```

    This command will return a list of all KMS keys along with their KeyId and Arn.

3. **Describe Key Policy**: For each KeyId returned in the previous step, use the `get-key-policy` command to get the policy of the key. The command is as follows:

    ```
    aws kms get-key-policy --key-id <key-id> --policy-name default
    ```

    Replace `<key-id>` with the KeyId of the key. This command will return the policy of the key in JSON format.

4. **Check Number of KMS Admins**: Parse the JSON output of the previous command to check the number of KMS admins. The policy JSON contains a statement array, and each statement has a Principal field which specifies the IAM users and roles that are granted permissions. If the Principal field contains more than the desired number of IAM users or roles, then the KMS key policy is not designed to limit the number of KMS admins. You can use a tool like `jq` to parse the JSON output in the command line, or you can use a programming language like Python to parse the JSON output.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Import the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) modules and initialize a new KMS client:

```python
import boto3
kms_client = boto3.client('kms')
```

2. Retrieve all the KMS keys in your AWS account:

```python
response = kms_client.list_keys()
kms_keys = response['Keys']
```

3. For each KMS key, retrieve the key policy and parse it to check the number of admins:

```python
for key in kms_keys:
    key_id = key['KeyId']
    policy = kms_client.get_key_policy(KeyId=key_id, PolicyName='default')
```

4. Parse the policy and count the number of admins. If the number of admins is more than a certain threshold (e.g., 2), print a warning message:

```python
import json
policy_document = json.loads(policy['Policy'])
admin_count = 0
for statement in policy_document['Statement']:
    if 'kms:Create*' in statement['Action'] or 'kms:Describe*' in statement['Action']:
        admin_count += 1
if admin_count > 2:
    print(f"Warning: KMS key {key_id} has too many admins ({admin_count}).")
```

This script will print a warning for each KMS key that has more than 2 admins. You can adjust the threshold as per your organization's requirements.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this issue for AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the KMS key ID that needs to be remediated.

2. Create a new IAM policy that grants the required permissions for KMS key management.

3. Attach the new IAM policy to an IAM user or role that needs to manage the KMS key.

4. Remove the KMS key administrator permissions from the existing IAM users or roles.

Here are the detailed steps:

Step 1: Identify the KMS key ID that needs to be remediated

Use the following command to list all the KMS keys in your AWS account:

```
aws kms list-keys
```

Identify the KMS key ID that needs to be remediated.

Step 2: Create a new IAM policy that grants the required permissions for KMS key management

Create a new IAM policy that grants the required permissions for KMS key management. Here's an example of a policy that allows a user to manage a specific KMS key:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowKeyManagement",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Create*",
                "kms:Describe*",
                "kms:Enable*",
                "kms:List*",
                "kms:Put*",
                "kms:Update*",
                "kms:Revoke*",
                "kms:Disable*",
                "kms:Get*",
                "kms:Delete*",
                "kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion",
                "kms:CancelKeyDeletion"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
        }
    ]
}
```

Replace the KMS key ARN with the ARN of the KMS key that needs to be managed.

Step 3: Attach the new IAM policy to an IAM user or role that needs to manage the KMS key

Use the following command to attach the new IAM policy to an IAM user or role:

```
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <user-name> --policy-arn <policy-arn>
```

Replace `<user-name>` with the name of the IAM user or role that needs to manage the KMS key, and `<policy-arn>` with the ARN of the new IAM policy.

Step 4: Remove the KMS key administrator permissions from the existing IAM users or roles

Use the following command to remove the KMS key administrator permissions from the existing IAM users or roles:

```
aws kms revoke-grant --key-id <key-id> --grant-id <grant-id>
```

Replace `<key-id>` with the ID of the KMS key, and `<grant-id>` with the ID of the grant that needs to be revoked.

Repeat this command for each grant that needs to be revoked.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of KMS key policies that should be designed to limit the number of KMS admins for AWS.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to identify the KMS keys that have overly permissive key policies. You can use the `boto3` library in Python to list all the KMS keys and their key policies.

```python
import boto3

# Create a KMS client
kms = boto3.client('kms')

# List all the KMS keys
response = kms.list_keys()

# Loop through each key and print its key policy
for key in response['Keys']:
    key_id = key['KeyId']
    key_policy = kms.get_key_policy(KeyId=key_id, PolicyName='default')['Policy']
    print(f"Key ID: {key_id} \nKey Policy: {key_policy}")
```

2. Once you have identified the KMS keys with overly permissive key policies, you need to update their policies to limit the number of KMS admins. You can use the `put_key_policy` method to update the key policy.

```python
import json

# Define the new key policy
new_policy = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "key-policy-1",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Admin1",
                    "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Admin2"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "kms:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Allow use of the key",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Encrypt",
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:ReEncrypt*",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
                "kms:DescribeKey"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

# Update the key policy for a specific KMS key
response = kms.put_key_policy(
    KeyId='1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab',
    PolicyName='default',
    Policy=json.dumps(new_policy)
)
```

In the above code, you need to replace the `KeyId` with the ID of the KMS key that you want to update, and replace the `AWS` ARNs with the ARNs of the IAM users who should have KMS admin permissions.

3. Repeat step 2 for all the KMS keys with overly permissive key policies.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of KMS key policies being designed to limit the number of KMS admins in AWS using Python.
