### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Key Management Service (KMS) dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu, then typing "KMS" in the search box and selecting "Key Management Service" from the dropdown list.
3. In the KMS dashboard, select "Customer managed keys" from the left-hand side menu. This will display a list of all the Customer Master Keys (CMKs) that are currently available within your AWS account.
4. To check if a CMK is in use, look at the "Key Usage" column. If the key is being used, it will display "Encrypt and decrypt". If the key is not in use, it will display "None".

#### Using CLI

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. **List All KMS Keys**: Use the AWS CLI command `aws kms list-keys` to list all the KMS keys in your account. This command will return a list of all the KMS keys along with their key IDs and ARNs.

    ```
    aws kms list-keys
    ```

3. **Check Key Usage**: For each key returned by the previous command, you can check its usage by using the `aws kms get-key-rotation-status` command followed by the key ID. This command will return the rotation status for the specified key.

    ```
    aws kms get-key-rotation-status --key-id <key-id>
    ```

4. **Analyze the Output**: If the key rotation status is `false`, it means the key is not in use. If it's `true`, it means the key is in use. You can use this information to identify any KMS Customer Master Keys that are not in use.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. For AWS, the primary library is boto3. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the client: Once you have installed the necessary libraries, you can import them into your script and initialize the AWS client.

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('kms')
```

3. List all the keys and check their usage: You can use the `list_keys` method to get a list of all the keys. Then, for each key, you can use the `get_key_rotation_status` method to check if the key is in use.

```python
keys = client.list_keys()

for key in keys['Keys']:
    key_id = key['KeyId']
    key_rotation_status = client.get_key_rotation_status(KeyId=key_id)
    if not key_rotation_status['KeyRotationEnabled']:
        print(f"Key {key_id} is not in use.")
```

4. Handle exceptions: It's important to handle exceptions in your script to ensure that it doesn't crash if something goes wrong. You can use a try-except block to catch any exceptions that might occur.

```python
try:
    keys = client.list_keys()
    for key in keys['Keys']:
        key_id = key['KeyId']
        key_rotation_status = client.get_key_rotation_status(KeyId=key_id)
        if not key_rotation_status['KeyRotationEnabled']:
            print(f"Key {key_id} is not in use.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This script will print out the IDs of all keys that are not in use. If you want to take action on these keys, you can modify the script to do so.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the KMS Customer Master Key Should Be In Use misconfiguration in AWS using AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) console.

2. Click on the "Customer managed keys" option in the left-hand menu.

3. Identify the key that is not in use and select it by clicking on its alias.

4. Click on the "Key actions" dropdown menu and select "Enable Key".

5. In the pop-up window, select the AWS service(s) that you want to use the key with and click "Enable".

6. Once enabled, the key will be available for use by the selected AWS service(s).

7. Repeat steps 3-6 for any other keys that are not in use.

8. Verify that the KMS Customer Master Key is now in use by checking the compliance status of the resource or by running a compliance check.

By following these steps, you can remediate the KMS Customer Master Key Should Be In Use misconfiguration in AWS using AWS console.

#### Using CLI

The misconfiguration "KMS Customer Master Key Should Be In Use" suggests that the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is not being used to encrypt data at rest. To remediate this, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the resources that are not using KMS encryption. You can use the following command to list all the EBS volumes that are not encrypted with KMS:
```
aws ec2 describe-volumes --query "Volumes[?Encrypted=='false']"
```

2. Encrypt the EBS volumes with KMS. To do this, create a new KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) or use an existing one. You can use the following command to create a new CMK:
```
aws kms create-key --description "My new CMK"
```

3. Once you have a CMK, you can use it to encrypt the EBS volumes. You can use the following command to encrypt a specific EBS volume:
```
aws ec2 modify-volume --volume-id <volume-id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <kms-key-id>
```
Replace `<volume-id>` with the ID of the EBS volume and `<kms-key-id>` with the ID of the CMK.

4. Repeat step 3 for all the EBS volumes that are not encrypted with KMS.

5. Finally, verify that all the EBS volumes are encrypted with KMS. You can use the following command to list all the EBS volumes and their encryption status:
```
aws ec2 describe-volumes --query "Volumes[*].[VolumeId,Encrypted,KmsKeyId]"
``` 

Note: Make sure to test the remediation steps in a non-production environment before applying them to a production environment.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of KMS Customer Master Key Should Be In Use in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Identify the AWS resource that is not using a KMS customer master key. This can be done by using the AWS CLI command `aws kms list-aliases` to list all the KMS customer master keys and `aws kms list-grants` to list all the grants for the KMS customer master keys.

2. Once you have identified the resource that is not using a KMS customer master key, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update the resource to use a KMS customer master key. For example, if the resource is an S3 bucket, you can use the following code snippet to update the bucket policy to use a KMS customer master key:

```python
import boto3
import json

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'
kms_key_arn = 'your-kms-key-arn'

bucket_policy = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DenyUnEncryptedObjectUploads",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{}/*".format(bucket_name),
            "Condition": {
                "Null": {
                    "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "true"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

bucket_policy['Statement'][0]['Condition']['StringEquals'] = {
    "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id": kms_key_arn
}

s3.put_bucket_policy(
    Bucket=bucket_name,
    Policy=json.dumps(bucket_policy)
)
```

This code snippet updates the bucket policy to deny uploads of unencrypted objects and adds a condition to require the use of a KMS customer master key for server-side encryption of objects in the bucket.

3. Repeat the above steps for any other AWS resources that are not using a KMS customer master key.
