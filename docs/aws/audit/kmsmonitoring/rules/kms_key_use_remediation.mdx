<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of "KMS Customer Master Key Should Be In Use" in AWS KMS using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the KMS Dashboard:**
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Open the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) console by searching for "KMS" in the services search bar.

2. **Create a Customer Master Key (CMK):**
   - In the KMS console, click on "Customer managed keys" in the left-hand navigation pane.
   - Click the "Create key" button.
   - Follow the wizard to configure your new CMK, including setting key usage permissions and key policies.

3. **Assign the CMK to Resources:**
   - Identify the AWS resources (e.g., S3 buckets, EBS volumes, RDS instances) that should use the CMK for encryption.
   - For each resource, navigate to its respective console (e.g., S3, EC2, RDS).
   - Modify the encryption settings to use the newly created CMK. For example, in S3, you can set the default encryption to use the CMK by selecting the bucket, going to the "Properties" tab, and configuring the "Default encryption" settings.

4. **Monitor Key Usage:**
   - Regularly review the usage of your CMKs to ensure they are being utilized as intended.
   - In the KMS console, you can view key usage metrics and logs to verify that the CMKs are actively being used for encryption and decryption operations.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your KMS Customer Master Keys are properly configured and in use, thereby preventing the misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of "KMS Customer Master Key Should Be In Use" in AWS using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Customer Master Key (CMK):**
   Ensure you have a CMK created in AWS KMS. If you don't have one, you can create it using the following command:
   ```sh
   aws kms create-key --description "My CMK for encryption" --key-usage ENCRYPT_DECRYPT --origin AWS_KMS
   ```

2. **Enable Key Rotation:**
   Enable automatic key rotation for your CMK to ensure it is regularly rotated and remains secure:
   ```sh
   aws kms enable-key-rotation --key-id <your-key-id>
   ```

3. **Assign Key Policies:**
   Ensure that the key policies are correctly set to allow the necessary IAM roles and users to use the CMK. You can attach a key policy using the following command:
   ```sh
   aws kms put-key-policy --key-id <your-key-id> --policy-name default --policy file://key-policy.json
   ```
   Make sure to replace `key-policy.json` with the path to your JSON policy file.

4. **Use the CMK in Your Services:**
   Ensure that your AWS services (like S3, EBS, RDS, etc.) are configured to use the CMK for encryption. For example, to use the CMK for an S3 bucket:
   ```sh
   aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket <your-bucket-name> --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules":[{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"aws:kms","KMSMasterKeyID":"<your-key-id>"}}]}'
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your KMS Customer Master Key is in use and properly configured to prevent misconfigurations.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of not using KMS Customer Master Keys (CMKs) in AWS KMS using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Boto3 Library**:
   Ensure you have the Boto3 library installed, which is the AWS SDK for Python. You can install it using pip if you haven't already.

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create a KMS Client**:
   Initialize a KMS client using Boto3 to interact with AWS KMS.

   ```python
   import boto3

   kms_client = boto3.client('kms')
   ```

3. **Create a Customer Master Key (CMK)**:
   Create a new CMK if you don't already have one. This key will be used for encryption.

   ```python
   response = kms_client.create_key(
       Description='My CMK for encrypting data',
       KeyUsage='ENCRYPT_DECRYPT',
       Origin='AWS_KMS'
   )

   cmk_id = response['KeyMetadata']['KeyId']
   print(f"Created CMK with ID: {cmk_id}")
   ```

4. **Use the CMK for Encryption**:
   Ensure that you use the created CMK for encrypting your data. Here is an example of how to encrypt data using the CMK.

   ```python
   plaintext = b'Hello, this is a secret message!'
   
   encrypt_response = kms_client.encrypt(
       KeyId=cmk_id,
       Plaintext=plaintext
   )

   ciphertext = encrypt_response['CiphertextBlob']
   print(f"Encrypted data: {ciphertext}")
   ```

By following these steps, you ensure that a Customer Master Key (CMK) is created and used for encryption, thereby preventing the misconfiguration of not using KMS CMKs.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Key Management Service (KMS) dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu, then typing "KMS" into the search bar and selecting "Key Management Service" from the dropdown menu.
3. In the KMS dashboard, select "Customer managed keys" from the left-hand menu. This will display a list of all the Customer Master Keys (CMKs) that are currently in your AWS account.
4. To check if a CMK is in use, look at the "Key Usage" column. If the key is being used, it will display "Encrypt and Decrypt". If the key is not in use, it will display "None".
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access KMS resources.

2. Once AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the KMS keys in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws kms list-keys --region your-region-name
   ```

   Replace 'your-region-name' with the name of the AWS region where your KMS keys are located. This command will return a list of all KMS keys in the specified region.

3. To check if a specific KMS key is in use, you need to check the key's rotation status. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws kms get-key-rotation-status --key-id your-key-id --region your-region-name
   ```

   Replace 'your-key-id' with the ID of the KMS key you want to check, and 'your-region-name' with the name of the AWS region where the key is located. This command will return the rotation status of the specified key.

4. If the key is not in use, the 'KeyRotationEnabled' field in the response will be 'false'. If the key is in use, the 'KeyRotationEnabled' field will be 'true'. This is because AWS automatically rotates keys that are in use. Therefore, if a key is not being rotated, it is likely not in use.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. For AWS, you will need the boto3 library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the client: In your Python script, you will need to import the boto3 library and initialize the KMS client. You can do this with the following code:

```python
import boto3

# Create a client
kms = boto3.client('kms')
```

3. List all the keys and check their usage: You can list all the keys in your AWS account using the list_keys() function. Then, for each key, you can check its usage using the get_key_rotation_status() function. If the key is not in use, print a message:

```python
# List all keys
response = kms.list_keys()

# For each key, check its usage
for key in response['Keys']:
    key_id = key['KeyId']
    rotation_status = kms.get_key_rotation_status(KeyId=key_id)
    
    # If the key is not in use, print a message
    if not rotation_status['KeyRotationEnabled']:
        print(f'Key {key_id} is not in use.')
```

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run the script. If there are any keys that are not in use, they will be printed out. If all keys are in use, nothing will be printed. This script will help you detect any KMS Customer Master Keys that are not in use in your AWS account.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The misconfiguration "KMS Customer Master Key Should Be In Use" suggests that the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is not being used to encrypt data at rest. To remediate this, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the resources that are not using KMS encryption. You can use the following command to list all the EBS volumes that are not encrypted with KMS:
```
aws ec2 describe-volumes --query "Volumes[?Encrypted=='false']"
```

2. Encrypt the EBS volumes with KMS. To do this, create a new KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) or use an existing one. You can use the following command to create a new CMK:
```
aws kms create-key --description "My new CMK"
```

3. Once you have a CMK, you can use it to encrypt the EBS volumes. You can use the following command to encrypt a specific EBS volume:
```
aws ec2 modify-volume --volume-id <volume-id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <kms-key-id>
```
Replace `<volume-id>` with the ID of the EBS volume and `<kms-key-id>` with the ID of the CMK.

4. Repeat step 3 for all the EBS volumes that are not encrypted with KMS.

5. Finally, verify that all the EBS volumes are encrypted with KMS. You can use the following command to list all the EBS volumes and their encryption status:
```
aws ec2 describe-volumes --query "Volumes[*].[VolumeId,Encrypted,KmsKeyId]"
``` 

Note: Make sure to test the remediation steps in a non-production environment before applying them to a production environment.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of KMS Customer Master Key Should Be In Use in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Identify the AWS resource that is not using a KMS customer master key. This can be done by using the AWS CLI command `aws kms list-aliases` to list all the KMS customer master keys and `aws kms list-grants` to list all the grants for the KMS customer master keys.

2. Once you have identified the resource that is not using a KMS customer master key, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update the resource to use a KMS customer master key. For example, if the resource is an S3 bucket, you can use the following code snippet to update the bucket policy to use a KMS customer master key:

```python
import boto3
import json

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'
kms_key_arn = 'your-kms-key-arn'

bucket_policy = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DenyUnEncryptedObjectUploads",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{}/*".format(bucket_name),
            "Condition": {
                "Null": {
                    "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "true"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

bucket_policy['Statement'][0]['Condition']['StringEquals'] = {
    "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id": kms_key_arn
}

s3.put_bucket_policy(
    Bucket=bucket_name,
    Policy=json.dumps(bucket_policy)
)
```

This code snippet updates the bucket policy to deny uploads of unencrypted objects and adds a condition to require the use of a KMS customer master key for server-side encryption of objects in the bucket.

3. Repeat the above steps for any other AWS resources that are not using a KMS customer master key.
