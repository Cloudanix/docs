4. Update applications and services - After the secrets are rotated, update the applications and services that use them with the new values.
5. Test the rotation process - Regularly test the rotation process to ensure that it is working as expected.
6. Monitor the rotation process - Monitor the rotation process to ensure that it is running on schedule and that there are no errors or issues.
