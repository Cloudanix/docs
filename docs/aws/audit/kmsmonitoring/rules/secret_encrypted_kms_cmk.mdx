<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To ensure that Secret Manager secrets are encrypted with Customer Master Keys (CMKs) in AWS KMS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Customer Master Key (CMK) in AWS KMS:**
   First, you need to create a CMK in AWS KMS if you don't already have one. This key will be used to encrypt your secrets.

   ```sh
   aws kms create-key --description "My CMK for Secret Manager" --key-usage ENCRYPT_DECRYPT --origin AWS_KMS
   ```

2. **Get the Key ID or ARN of the CMK:**
   After creating the CMK, you need to retrieve its Key ID or ARN to use it for encryption.

   ```sh
   aws kms list-keys
   ```

   This command will list all your keys. Note down the Key ID or ARN of the CMK you created.

3. **Create a Secret with the CMK:**
   When creating a new secret, specify the CMK to be used for encryption.

   ```sh
   aws secretsmanager create-secret --name MySecret --secret-string "MySecretValue" --kms-key-id <Your-CMK-Key-ID-or-ARN>
   ```

4. **Update an Existing Secret to Use the CMK:**
   If you have an existing secret that is not encrypted with a CMK, you can update it to use the CMK.

   ```sh
   aws secretsmanager update-secret --secret-id <Your-Secret-ID> --kms-key-id <Your-CMK-Key-ID-or-ARN>
   ```

By following these steps, you ensure that your secrets in AWS Secret Manager are encrypted using Customer Master Keys (CMKs) in AWS KMS, enhancing the security of your sensitive information.

   project_id = "my-project"
   location_id = "global"
   key_ring_id = "my-key-ring"
   key_id = "my-key"

   key_ring_name = client.key_ring_path(project_id, location_id, key_ring_id)
   key_ring = client.create_key_ring(request={"parent": key_ring_name, "key_ring_id": key_ring_id})

   key_name = client.crypto_key_path(project_id, location_id, key_ring_id, key_id)
   key = client.create_crypto_key(request={"parent": key_ring_name, "crypto_key_id": key_id, "crypto_key": {"purpose": kms_v1.CryptoKey.CryptoKeyPurpose.ENCRYPT_DECRYPT}})
   print(f"Created key with name: {key.name}")
   ```

3. **Create a Secret with CMK:**
   ```python
   from google.cloud import secretmanager

   client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient()
   project_id = "my-project"
   secret_id = "my-secret"
   secret_value = "my-secret-value"

   parent = f"projects/{project_id}"
   secret = client.create_secret(
       request={
           "parent": parent,
           "secret_id": secret_id,
           "secret": {"replication": {"automatic": {}}},
           "encryption": {"kms_key_name": key.name}
       }
   )

   payload = secretmanager.SecretPayload(data=secret_value.encode("UTF-8"))
   client.add_secret_version(request={"parent": secret.name, "payload": payload})
   print(f"Created secret with name: {secret.name}")
   ```

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms/.
3. In the navigation pane, choose "Customer managed keys". Here you can see all the keys that are managed by the customer.
4. For each key, click on its alias to open the key details page. Under the "Key policy" section, check if the key is used to encrypt any Secret Manager secrets. If not, it indicates that the Secret Manager secrets are not encrypted with CMKs in KMS.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to list all the secrets in the Secret Manager. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws secretsmanager list-secrets --region <region-name>
```

2. Once you have the list of secrets, you can describe each secret to get its details. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws secretsmanager describe-secret --secret-id <secret-id> --region <region-name>
```

3. In the output of the above command, look for the "KmsKeyId" field. This field indicates the AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt the secret. If this field is not present or if it's using the default AWS managed key (alias/aws/secretsmanager), then the secret is not encrypted with a customer managed key (CMK).

4. Repeat the above steps for all the secrets in the Secret Manager. If any secret is not encrypted with a CMK, then it's a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: You will need the `boto3` library for AWS, `azure-mgmt-keyvault` for Azure, and `google-cloud-secret-manager` for GCP. You can install these libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3 azure-mgmt-keyvault google-cloud-secret-manager
   ```

2. AWS: Use the `boto3` library to list all secrets in the Secret Manager and check if they are encrypted with a customer-managed key (CMK):

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('secretsmanager')

   response = client.list_secrets()

   for secret in response['SecretList']:
       if 'KmsKeyId' not in secret:
           print(f"Secret {secret['Name']} is not encrypted with a CMK")
   ```

3. Azure: Use the `azure-mgmt-keyvault` library to list all secrets in the Key Vault and check if they are encrypted with a customer-managed key:

   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.keyvault import KeyVaultManagementClient
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   client = KeyVaultManagementClient(credential, "<subscription_id>")

   for vault in client.vaults.list():
       for secret in client.vaults.get(vault.name).properties.enabled_for_disk_encryption:
           if not secret:
               print(f"Secret {secret.name} in vault {vault.name} is not encrypted with a CMK")
   ```

4. GCP: Use the `google-cloud-secret-manager` library to list all secrets in the Secret Manager and check if they are encrypted with a customer-managed key:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import secretmanager

   client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient()

   for secret in client.list_secrets(request={"parent": "projects/<project_id>"}):
       if 'kmsKeyName' not in secret.replication.automatic:
           print(f"Secret {secret.name} is not encrypted with a CMK")
   ```
   
Please replace `<subscription_id>` and `<project_id>` with your actual Azure subscription ID and GCP project ID respectively.
