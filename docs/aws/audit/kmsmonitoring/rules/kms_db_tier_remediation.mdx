1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Databases" to navigate to the databases section.

3. Select the database instance that you want to check. In the details section, look for the "KMS key ID" field. If the field is empty or not present, it means that the database-tier KMS key is not in use.

4. To further verify, you can go to the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms/. Check if the key ID mentioned in the RDS database details is present and enabled in the KMS console. If it's not, then the KMS key is not in use for the selected database instance.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to list all the RDS instances in your AWS account. You can do this by using the AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier]' --output text
```

2. Once you have the list of RDS instances, you can check the KMS key associated with each instance. This can be done using the following command:

```bash
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <DBInstanceIdentifier> --query 'DBInstances[*].[KmsKeyId]' --output text
```
Replace `<DBInstanceIdentifier>` with the actual identifier of the RDS instance.

3. If the output of the above command is `None`, it means that the RDS instance is not using a KMS key. If it returns a KMS key ID, it means that the RDS instance is using that KMS key.

4. To ensure that the KMS key is in use, you can list all the grants for the KMS key using the following command:

```bash
aws kms list-grants --key-id <KmsKeyId> --query 'Grants[*].[GranteePrincipal]' --output text
```
Replace `<KmsKeyId>` with the actual KMS key ID. If the output includes the ARN of the RDS instance, it means that the KMS key is in use by the RDS instance.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if a Database-tier KMS Key is in use in AWS KMS using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Setup AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to set up Boto3. Install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. **List all KMS keys:**
   Use the `list_keys` method to retrieve all KMS keys. Here's a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a client
   kms = boto3.client('kms')

   # List keys
   response = kms.list_keys()

   # Print the keys
   for key in response['Keys']:
       print(key['KeyId'])
   ```

3. **Check if the key is used by RDS instances:**
   Use the `describe_db_instances` method from the RDS client to list all RDS instances and their KMS key IDs. Here's a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a client
   rds = boto3.client('rds')

   # List RDS instances
   response = rds.describe_db_instances()

   # Print the KMS key ID for each instance
   for instance in response['DBInstances']:
       print(instance['KmsKeyId'])
   ```

4. **Compare the keys:**
   Compare the keys from step 2 and step 3. If a key from step 2 is not found in step 3, it means that the key is not used by any RDS instance. Here's a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create KMS and RDS clients
   kms = boto3.client('kms')
   rds = boto3.client('rds')

   # List keys
   kms_response = kms.list_keys()

   # List RDS instances
   rds_response = rds.describe_db_instances()

   # Get the KMS key IDs
   kms_keys = [key['KeyId'] for key in kms_response['Keys']]

   # Get the KMS key IDs used by RDS instances
   rds_keys = [instance['KmsKeyId'] for instance in rds_response['DBInstances']]

   # Find the keys that are not used by RDS instances
   unused_keys = set(kms_keys) - set(rds_keys)

   # Print the unused keys
   for key in unused_keys:
       print(key)
   ```
   This script will print the IDs of the KMS keys that are not used by any RDS instance.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
The remediation steps for "Database-tier KMS Key Should Be In Use" in AWS using the AWS console are as follows:

1. Open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Encryption".
3. Select the DB instance that you want to encrypt.
4. Click on the "Modify" button.
5. In the "Encryption" section, choose "Yes" for the "Encrypt this DB instance" option.
6. Select the KMS key that you want to use for encryption in the "KMS key ID" drop-down list.
7. Click on the "Continue" button.
8. Review the changes and click on the "Modify DB instance" button to apply the changes.

After completing these steps, the database-tier KMS key will be in use, and the misconfiguration will be remediated.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the "Database-tier KMS Key Should Be In Use" misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the RDS instances in your AWS account:

```
aws rds describe-db-instances
```

3. Identify the RDS instance that has the misconfiguration.

4. Run the following command to modify the RDS instance to use a KMS key:

```
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> --kms-key-id <your-kms-key-id>
```

Replace `<your-db-instance-identifier>` with the name of your RDS instance and `<your-kms-key-id>` with the ID of the KMS key that you want to use.

5. Verify that the RDS instance is now using the KMS key by running the following command:

```
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> | grep KmsKeyId
```

This command should return the ID of the KMS key that you specified in step 4.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for all the RDS instances that have the misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the "Database-tier KMS Key Should Be In Use" misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the RDS instances that are not using a KMS key for encryption.

2. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to modify the RDS instances to use a KMS key for encryption.

Here is the Python code to accomplish this:

```python
import boto3

# Create an RDS client
rds = boto3.client('rds')

# Get a list of all RDS instances
instances = rds.describe_db_instances()

# Loop through each instance and check if it is using a KMS key for encryption
for instance in instances['DBInstances']:
    if 'KmsKeyId' not in instance:
        # If the instance is not using a KMS key, modify it to use one
        rds.modify_db_instance(
            DBInstanceIdentifier=instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'],
            KmsKeyId='your_kms_key_id_here'
        )
```

Replace "your_kms_key_id_here" with the ID of the KMS key that you want to use for encryption.

This code will loop through all RDS instances and modify any instances that are not using a KMS key for encryption to use the specified KMS key.
