How to recover KMS keys which are disabled and scheduled for deletion?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "KMS Keys Scheduled For Deletion Should Be Recovered" Policy.)
2. From the left navigation pane, click on "Customer managed keys" to view the list of KMS keys.
3. Look for the disabled and scheduled for deletion KMS key in the list. The key will have a status indicating that it is scheduled for deletion.
4. Select the disabled key by clicking on its name.
5. In the key details page, scroll down to the "Key actions" section.
6. Click on the "Schedule key deletion" button.
7. In the "Schedule key deletion" dialog box, review the key's deletion date. If the key has not been deleted yet, you can recover it before the deletion date.
8. Click on the "Cancel deletion" button to recover the key.
9. Confirm the cancellation of deletion when prompted.
10. Once the key is recovered, it will return to an enabled state and can be used for encryption and decryption operations.
