How to enable database-tier KMS key?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Database-tier KMS Key Should Be In Use" Policy.)
2. From the left navigation pane, click on "Customer managed keys" to view the list of KMS keys.
3. Click on the "Create key" button.
4. In the "Create key" wizard, choose the option for "Symmetric" key.
5. Select the "KMS key material origin" as "KMS generates the key material" (the default option).
6. Under "Alias", provide a unique and meaningful alias for the key. The alias will be used to identify the key and should be easily recognizable.
7. In the "Key administrators" section, specify the IAM users or roles that should have administrative access to the key. This step is optional if you want to limit the key administrators.
8. In the "Key usage permissions" section, specify the IAM users or roles that should have usage permissions for the key. These permissions control who can encrypt or decrypt data using the key.
9. Under "Key state configuration", choose the option for "Enable automatic key rotation" if you want to enable automatic key rotation for increased security.
10. Review the other optional settings, such as tags, and configure them as needed.
11. Click on the "Next" button to proceed.
12. On the "Review" page, verify the key settings and configurations.
13. If everything looks correct, click on the "Finish" button to create the database-tier key.
14. Once the key is created, you will be redirected to the key details page. Take note of the key ID and alias for future reference.
