### Remediation

How to ensure that any publicly accessible AWS Key Management Service master keys are not identified?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the left navigation Menu, click Encryption Key and click the KMS key that you want to reconfigure (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource).

- Step 2: On the selected key configuration page, inside the Key Policy section, perform one of the following actions:
  A: Replace the "Everyone" grantee (i.e. '\*') from the Principal element value with an AWS account ID (e.g. '123456789012') or an AWS account ARN (e.g. 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root').
  B: Add a Condition clause such as "Condition':
  \{"StringEquals": \{ "kms:CallerAccount": "123456789012" \} \} to the existing policy statement.
- Step 3: Click Save Changes to apply the policy changes.
