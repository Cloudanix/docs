1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Customer managed keys". This will display a list of all your customer managed keys.

3. For each key, click on the key ID to open its details page. 

4. In the Key policy section, check if the "Effect" is set to "Allow" and "Principal" is set to "*". If it is, then the KMS key is exposed.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all KMS keys: Use the `list-keys` command to get a list of all KMS keys in your account. The command is as follows:
   ```
   aws kms list-keys
   ```
   This command will return a list of all KMS keys along with their key IDs.

3. Describe key policy: For each key ID returned in the previous step, use the `get-key-policy` command to get the policy of the key. The command is as follows:
   ```
   aws kms get-key-policy --key-id <key-id> --policy-name default
   ```
   Replace `<key-id>` with the actual key ID. This command will return the policy of the key in JSON format.

4. Check the policy: Inspect the returned policy for any statements that allow the `*` (all) action or have the `Principal` set to `*` (all). If such statements exist, it means the KMS key is exposed.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. For AWS, you will need the boto3 library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the client: After installing the necessary libraries, you need to import them into your script and initialize the AWS client.

```python
import boto3

# Create a client
client = boto3.client('kms')
```

3. List all KMS keys: You can use the `list_keys` function to get a list of all KMS keys in your AWS account.

```python
# List all KMS keys
response = client.list_keys()

# Print the list of keys
for key in response['Keys']:
    print(key['KeyId'])
```

4. Check the key policy: For each key, you can use the `get_key_policy` function to get the policy of the key. If the policy allows the key to be used by any AWS account or an anonymous user, then the key is exposed.

```python
# Check the key policy
for key in response['Keys']:
    policy = client.get_key_policy(KeyId=key['KeyId'], PolicyName='default')
    if 'AWS: *' in policy['Policy'] or 'AWS: anonymous' in policy['Policy']:
        print(f"Key {key['KeyId']} is exposed")
```

This script will print the IDs of all exposed KMS keys.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the AWS KMS console.
3. Click on the "Aliases" tab.
4. Select the KMS key that is exposed.
5. Click on the "Key Policy" button.
6. Review the Key Policy to ensure that it is not exposing the KMS key.
7. If the Key Policy is exposing the KMS key, click on the "Edit" button.
8. Update the Key Policy to remove any permissions that expose the KMS key.
9. Click on the "Review and Save" button.
10. Review the changes made to the Key Policy.
11. Click on the "Save Changes" button to save the updated Key Policy.

Once you have completed these steps, the KMS key will no longer be exposed and the misconfiguration will be remediated.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the issue of KMS Keys being exposed in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. List all the KMS keys in your AWS account by running the following command:
```
aws kms list-keys
```

2. Identify the KMS key(s) that are exposed and note down their Key IDs.

3. Remove the Key Policy from the KMS key(s) by running the following command:
```
aws kms put-key-policy --key-id <key-id> --policy-name default --policy "{}"
```
Replace `<key-id>` with the Key ID of the KMS key that you want to remediate.

4. Verify that the Key Policy has been removed by running the following command:
```
aws kms get-key-policy --key-id <key-id> --policy-name default
```
Replace `<key-id>` with the Key ID of the KMS key that you remediated. This command should return an empty policy.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the exposed KMS keys in your AWS account.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the issue of KMS Keys being exposed in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of KMS Keys being exposed in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Identify the KMS keys that are exposed.

You can use the AWS CLI command `aws kms list-keys` to list all the KMS keys in your AWS account. Then, you can use the `aws kms describe-key` command to get the details of each key and check if any of them are exposed.

Step 2: Revoke the key policy that is exposing the KMS key.

You can use the `aws kms put-key-policy` command to revoke the key policy that is exposing the KMS key. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```python
import boto3

# Create a KMS client
kms = boto3.client('kms')

# Specify the key ID and the policy name
key_id = 'your_key_id'
policy_name = 'your_policy_name'

# Get the current key policy
key_policy = kms.get_key_policy(KeyId=key_id, PolicyName=policy_name)

# Revoke the key policy
key_policy['Policy'] = '{"Statement": []}'
kms.put_key_policy(KeyId=key_id, PolicyName=policy_name, Policy=json.dumps(key_policy['Policy']))
```

Step 3: Monitor the KMS keys to ensure they are not exposed again.

You can set up CloudWatch alarms to monitor the KMS keys and get notified if any of them are exposed again. You can also use AWS Config to monitor the KMS keys and get notified if any of the key policies are changed.
