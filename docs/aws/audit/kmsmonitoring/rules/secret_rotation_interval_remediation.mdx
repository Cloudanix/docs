### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms/.
3. In the navigation pane, choose "Customer managed keys".
4. In the "Customer managed keys" section, you will see a list of all the KMS keys available in your current AWS region. 
5. For each key listed, check the "Rotation status" column. If the status is "Not rotated", it means the key is not being rotated regularly.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Secrets Manager and KMS services.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the secrets stored in the Secrets Manager by running the following command:

   ```
   aws secretsmanager list-secrets
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object containing all the secrets in your AWS account.

3. To check the rotation configuration for each secret, you can use the `describe-secret` command followed by the secret's name or ARN. For example:

   ```
   aws secretsmanager describe-secret --secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object containing the details of the secret. Look for the `RotationRules` field in the output. If the `AutomaticallyAfterDays` field is not set or is set to a high number, it means the secret is not being rotated frequently.

4. To check the last time a secret was rotated, look for the `LastRotatedDate` field in the output of the `describe-secret` command. If this date is too far in the past, it means the secret has not been rotated recently. 

Remember, these steps only help in detecting the misconfiguration. You would need to take further steps to remediate this issue.

#### Using Python

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) modules and initialize a new client for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS):

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import BotoCoreError, ClientError

kms_client = boto3.client('kms')
```

2. List all the keys in your AWS account:

```python
try:
    response = kms_client.list_keys()
except ClientError as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    return
```

3. For each key, get the key rotation status:

```python
for key in response['Keys']:
    key_id = key['KeyId']
    try:
        rotation_status = kms_client.get_key_rotation_status(KeyId=key_id)
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        continue
```

4. Check if the key rotation is enabled. If it's not, print a message:

```python
    if not rotation_status['KeyRotationEnabled']:
        print(f"Key {key_id} does not have rotation enabled.")
```

This script will list all the keys in your AWS account and check if they have key rotation enabled. If a key does not have rotation enabled, it will print a message. This can help you detect misconfigurations where Secrets Manager secrets are not being rotated frequently.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of Secrets Manager secrets not being rotated frequently in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Secrets Manager console.
2. Select the secret that needs to be rotated.
3. Click on the "Rotation" tab.
4. Click on the "Edit rotation" button.
5. In the "Configure rotation" section, select the rotation frequency and the number of days to keep the previous version of the secret.
6. Click on the "Enable rotation" checkbox.
7. Choose the Lambda function or AWS Secrets Manager to rotate the secret.
8. Click on the "Save changes" button.

By following these steps, the Secrets Manager secret will be automatically rotated according to the selected frequency, and the previous versions of the secret will be kept for the specified number of days.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Secrets Manager Secrets not being rotated frequently in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the secrets available in the Secrets Manager service:

```
aws secretsmanager list-secrets
```
3. Identify the secret that needs to be rotated frequently.

4. Run the following command to rotate the secret:

```
aws secretsmanager rotate-secret --secret-id <secret-id>
```

Note: Replace `<secret-id>` with the ID of the secret that needs to be rotated.

5. After running the above command, the Secrets Manager service will create a new version of the secret and update the old version with a new password or other credentials.

6. Update the applications or services that use the secret with the new credentials.

7. Delete the old version of the secret using the following command:

```
aws secretsmanager delete-secret --secret-id <secret-id> --force-delete-without-recovery
```

Note: Replace `<secret-id>` with the ID of the old version of the secret.

8. Repeat the above steps periodically to ensure that secrets are rotated frequently. It is recommended to set up automated rotation using AWS Lambda or other automation tools.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of Secrets Manager Secrets not being rotated frequently in AWS, you can use the following steps using Python:

1. Import the Boto3 library for AWS:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create an AWS Secrets Manager client:

```python
client = boto3.client('secretsmanager')
```

3. Get a list of all secrets in AWS Secrets Manager:

```python
secrets = client.list_secrets()
```

4. Loop through the list of secrets and check if each secret has been rotated within the last 30 days:

```python
for secret in secrets['SecretList']:
    if 'RotationRules' in secret:
        rotation_days = secret['RotationRules']['AutomaticallyAfterDays']
        last_rotated_date = secret['LastRotatedDate']
        if (datetime.now() - last_rotated_date).days > rotation_days:
            # Secret has not been rotated within the last 30 days
            # Code to rotate the secret goes here
```

5. If a secret has not been rotated within the last 30 days, use the `rotate_secret` function to rotate the secret:

```python
client.rotate_secret(SecretId=secret['ARN'])
```

6. Add logging and error handling to the script as needed.

7. Schedule the script to run on a regular basis (e.g. daily) using AWS Lambda or a cron job.

By following these steps, you can ensure that all secrets in AWS Secrets Manager are rotated frequently, which helps to improve the security of your AWS environment.
