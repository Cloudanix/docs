1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Key Management Service (KMS) dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu, then typing "KMS" in the search box and selecting "Key Management Service" from the dropdown list.
3. In the KMS dashboard, select "Customer managed keys" from the left-hand side menu. This will display a list of all the KMS keys that are currently available within your AWS account.
4. For each key listed, click on the key ID to open its details page. In the "Key policy" section, check the "Principal" attribute in the policy statement. If the "Principal" attribute has a value of "*" (which means any AWS account) or an AWS account ID that is not familiar, it means the KMS key allows unknown cross-account access.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you start, make sure that AWS CLI is installed and configured on your system. You can install it using pip (Python package installer). The command to install AWS CLI is `pip install awscli`. After installation, configure it using `aws configure` command. You will be asked to provide your AWS credentials, region and output format.

2. **List all KMS Keys**: Use the `list-keys` command to list all the KMS keys in your account. The command is `aws kms list-keys`. This will return a list of all KMS keys along with their KeyId and Arn.

3. **Describe Key Policy**: For each KeyId returned from the previous step, use the `get-key-policy` command to get the policy of the key. The command is `aws kms get-key-policy --key-id <KeyId> --policy-name default`. Replace `<KeyId>` with the actual KeyId. This will return the policy of the key in JSON format.

4. **Check for Unknown Cross Account Access**: Parse the JSON output from the previous step and check the `Statement` array. Each statement represents a permission and contains `Principal` and `Action` fields. If the `Principal` field contains an AWS account ID that you do not recognize or '*' (which represents all AWS accounts), and the `Action` field allows actions that you do not want to allow, then the KMS key allows unknown cross account access.

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You will need the 'boto3' library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can set your credentials for use by boto3 in several ways, but a common way is to use the AWS CLI. Run 'aws configure' and then enter your access key, secret access key, and default region when prompted.

3. Write a Python script to list all KMS keys and their policies: Use the 'boto3' library to create a client for AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Then, use the 'list_keys' method to get a list of all KMS keys. For each key, use the 'get_key_policy' method to get the policy of the key. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a KMS client
   kms = boto3.client('kms')

   # List all KMS keys
   response = kms.list_keys()

   for key in response['Keys']:
       # Get the policy of the key
       policy = kms.get_key_policy(KeyId=key['KeyId'], PolicyName='default')
       print('Key ID: ', key['KeyId'])
       print('Policy: ', policy['Policy'])
   ```

4. Analyze the policies: The 'get_key_policy' method returns the policy of the key as a JSON string. You need to parse this string and analyze the policy. If the policy allows access from unknown cross accounts, then the KMS key is misconfigured. You can use the 'json' library to parse the JSON string. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import json

   # Parse the policy
   policy_dict = json.loads(policy['Policy'])

   # Check if the policy allows access from unknown cross accounts
   for statement in policy_dict['Statement']:
       if 'AWS' in statement['Principal']:
           # If the principal is not a known account, print a warning
           if statement['Principal']['AWS'] not in known_accounts:
               print('Warning: Key ', key['KeyId'], ' allows access from unknown account ', statement['Principal']['AWS'])
   ```
   
Please replace `known_accounts` with a list of your known AWS account IDs.

To remediate the misconfiguration "KMS Keys Should Not Allow Unknown Cross Account Access" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Identify the KMS keys that allow unknown cross-account access:
   
   ```
   aws kms list-keys --query "Keys[?KeyManager != 'AWS' && KeyState == 'Enabled']" --output text | awk '{print $1}' | while read key_id; do aws kms get-key-policy --key-id $key_id --policy-name default --query Policy --output text | grep -q "Effect\": \"Allow" && echo $key_id; done
   ```

2. Remove the unknown cross-account access from the KMS key policy:

   ```
   aws kms list-keys --query "Keys[?KeyManager != 'AWS' && KeyState == 'Enabled']" --output text | awk '{print $1}' | while read key_id; do aws kms get-key-policy --key-id $key_id --policy-name default --query Policy --output text | sed '/Effect\": \"Allow\"/,/\"Principal\": {/d' > policy.json && aws kms put-key-policy --key-id $key_id --policy-name default --policy file://policy.json && rm policy.json; done
   ```

3. Verify that the unknown cross-account access has been removed:

   ```
   aws kms list-keys --query "Keys[?KeyManager != 'AWS' && KeyState == 'Enabled']" --output text | awk '{print $1}' | while read key_id; do aws kms get-key-policy --key-id $key_id --policy-name default --query Policy --output text | grep -q "Effect\": \"Allow" && echo $key_id; done
   ```

   If there is no output, then the remediation is successful.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "KMS Keys Should Not Allow Unknown Cross Account Access" for AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the KMS keys that are allowing unknown cross-account access. You can do this by using the AWS CLI command `aws kms list-keys` to get a list of all the KMS keys and then using the `aws kms describe-key` command to get the key policy for each key.

2. Check the key policy to see if it allows unknown cross-account access. You can do this by looking for the `"AWS"` field in the `Principal` element of the policy. If the `"AWS"` field is set to `"*"` or does not include a specific account ID, then the key allows unknown cross-account access.

3. Modify the key policy to remove the unknown cross-account access. You can do this by using the `aws kms put-key-policy` command to update the key policy. You will need to specify the key ID, the policy name, and the new policy document that removes the `"AWS"` field or replaces it with a specific account ID.

4. Test the modified key policy to ensure that it no longer allows unknown cross-account access. You can do this by using the `aws kms encrypt` command to encrypt a test message using the modified key. If the encryption is successful, then the key policy has been remediated.

Here is an example Python script that can be used to remediate the misconfiguration:

```python
import boto3
import json

# Initialize the KMS client
kms = boto3.client('kms')

# Get a list of all KMS keys
response = kms.list_keys()

# Loop through each key
for key in response['Keys']:
    # Get the key policy
    key_policy = kms.get_key_policy(KeyId=key['KeyId'], PolicyName='default')['Policy']

    # Parse the policy document
    policy_doc = json.loads(key_policy)

    # Check if the policy allows unknown cross-account access
    if 'AWS' in policy_doc['Statement'][0]['Principal'] and \
        ('*' in policy_doc['Statement'][0]['Principal']['AWS'] or \
        len(policy_doc['Statement'][0]['Principal']['AWS']) == 1):
        
        # Modify the policy to remove the unknown cross-account access
        policy_doc['Statement'][0]['Principal']['AWS'] = ['arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root']

        # Update the key policy
        response = kms.put_key_policy(KeyId=key['KeyId'], PolicyName='default', Policy=json.dumps(policy_doc))

        # Print the result
        print('Key policy updated for key ' + key['KeyId'])
``` 

Note: Replace the account ID `123456789012` with your own account ID.
