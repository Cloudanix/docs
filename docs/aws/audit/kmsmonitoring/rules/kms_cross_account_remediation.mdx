### Remediation

How to ensure that all your AWS Key Management Service keys are configured to be accessed only by trusted AWS accounts?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) by selecting "KMS" from the services menu.
3. In the KMS dashboard, click on "Customer managed keys" in the left navigation pane.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "KMS Keys Should Not Allow Unknown Cross Account Access" Policy.)
4. Identify the KMS keys that have cross-account access enabled.
5. Take note of the specific key identifier(s) that need remediation.
6. Select the checkbox next to the key(s) you want to remediate.
7. Above the list of keys, click on the "Edit key policy" button.
8. In the "Edit key policy" page, review the existing key policy for the selected key(s).
9. Identify the "Statement" section in the key policy that grants cross-account access.
10. Select and delete the statement(s) that allow cross-account access.
11. Ensure that the remaining statements provide appropriate permissions to authorized AWS identities or roles within the same account.
12. Once the key policy is updated, click on the "Save changes" button to apply the modified policy.
13. Monitor the status of the key policy update to ensure it is successfully applied to the KMS keys.
14. Repeat these steps for each KMS key that has cross-account access enabled until all keys have been remediated.
