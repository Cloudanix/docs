### More Info:

Ensure that Amazon Secrets Manager service is used in your AWS account to manage access credentials (i.e. secrets) such as API keys, OAuth tokens and database credentials. For example, you can use AWS Secrets Manager to handle database credentials to meet security and compliance requirements in your organization. Secrets Manager provides built-in integrations for MySQL, PostgreSQL and Aurora on Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), and can rotate, manage and retrieve credentials for these database types natively.
