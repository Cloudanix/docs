1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) dashboard.

2. In the navigation pane, select "Customer managed keys". This will display a list of all the customer-managed keys that are currently available in your AWS account.

3. For each key listed, click on its alias to open the key details page. Here, you can check the "Key users" section to see if AWS Secrets Manager is listed as a user. If it is not listed, then Secrets Manager is not in use for that particular key.

4. Repeat the process for all the keys listed in the "Customer managed keys" section. If none of the keys have AWS Secrets Manager listed as a user, then Secrets Manager is not in use in KMS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access KMS and Secrets Manager.

2. Once AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can list all the keys in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws kms list-keys
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the keys in your account, including their key IDs and ARNs.

3. To check if Secrets Manager is using these keys, you can list all the secrets in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws secretsmanager list-secrets
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the secrets in your account, including their names and ARNs.

4. For each secret, you can describe the secret to see which KMS key it's using by running the following command:

   ```
   aws secretsmanager describe-secret --secret-id <secret-name>
   ```
   Replace `<secret-name>` with the name of the secret. This command will return information about the secret, including the KMS key that it's using. If the `KmsKeyId` field is not present or does not match any of the keys listed in step 2, then Secrets Manager is not using KMS.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python that allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and create a session: In your Python script, you need to import the necessary libraries and create a session using your AWS credentials.

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ```

3. List all the keys in AWS KMS: Now, you can use the `list_keys` method to get a list of all the keys in AWS KMS.

   ```python
   kms = session.client('kms')
   response = kms.list_keys()

   for key in response['Keys']:
       print(key['KeyId'])
   ```

4. Check if Secrets Manager is in use: To check if Secrets Manager is in use, you can list all the secrets and check if the KMS key is used by any of them.

   ```python
   secrets_manager = session.client('secretsmanager')
   response = secrets_manager.list_secrets()

   for secret in response['SecretList']:
       if 'KmsKeyId' in secret and secret['KmsKeyId'] == 'arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef':
           print('Secrets Manager is in use with KMS key: ' + secret['KmsKeyId'])
   ```

   Replace 'arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef' with the ARN of the KMS key you are interested in.

Please note that you need to replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', and 'us-west-2' with your actual AWS access key, secret key, and region. Also, you need to have the necessary permissions to list keys in AWS KMS and to list secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the "Secrets Manager Should Be In Use" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Secrets Manager service.
3. Click on the "Create secret" button.
4. Select the type of secret you want to create (such as "Other type of secrets").
5. Enter the details for the secret, such as the secret name and the secret value.
6. Click on the "Next" button.
7. Configure the rotation settings for the secret, if applicable.
8. Click on the "Next" button.
9. Review the details of the secret.
10. Click on the "Store" button to create the secret.

Once you have created the secret in AWS Secrets Manager, you can use it in your applications and services to securely store and retrieve sensitive information. Make sure to update your applications and services to use the new secret, and delete any other instances of the sensitive information that may have been stored elsewhere.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the issue of not using Secrets Manager in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. First, create a new Secrets Manager secret for the sensitive data that needs to be stored securely.

2. Then, update the application code to retrieve the sensitive data from Secrets Manager instead of being hardcoded in the code.

3. Next, remove any sensitive data that is currently stored in environment variables or configuration files.

4. Finally, update the IAM policies to grant the necessary permissions to access the Secrets Manager secret.

To create a new Secrets Manager secret using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to create a new secret:

```
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name my-secret --secret-string "my-secret-value"
```

2. Replace `my-secret` with the name of the secret you want to create, and `my-secret-value` with the value of the secret. You can also use the `--secret-file` option to specify a file containing the secret value.

3. Once the secret is created, you can update the application code to retrieve the secret value from Secrets Manager.

4. To remove any sensitive data that is currently stored in environment variables or configuration files, review the code and remove any references to the sensitive data.

5. Finally, update the IAM policies to grant the necessary permissions to access the Secrets Manager secret. You can use the `aws secretsmanager get-secret-value` command to retrieve the secret value, so the IAM policy should include the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` action for the relevant resource.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Secrets Manager Should Be In Use" for AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, ensure that you have the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed on your system.

2. Next, you can use the Boto3 SDK to create a Secrets Manager resource in your AWS account. You can do this by creating a new Secrets Manager client object and using the create_secret method to create a new secret.

Here's some sample Python code that demonstrates how to create a new secret using Boto3:

```python
import boto3

# Create a new Secrets Manager client
client = boto3.client('secretsmanager')

# Create a new secret
response = client.create_secret(
    Name='my-secret',
    SecretString='{"username":"my-username", "password":"my-password"}'
)

# Print the ARN of the new secret
print(response['ARN'])
```

In this example, we're creating a new secret named "my-secret" with a username and password stored as a JSON string in the SecretString field.

3. Once you've created your new secret, you can update your application or infrastructure to use the Secrets Manager client to retrieve the secret values at runtime. This will ensure that your secrets are securely stored and managed by AWS.

Here's some sample Python code that demonstrates how to retrieve a secret using Boto3:

```python
import boto3

# Create a new Secrets Manager client
client = boto3.client('secretsmanager')

# Retrieve the secret value
response = client.get_secret_value(
    SecretId='my-secret'
)

# Print the secret value
print(response['SecretString'])
```

In this example, we're retrieving the value of the "my-secret" secret and printing it to the console.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Secrets Manager Should Be In Use" for AWS using Python and ensure that your secrets are securely managed by AWS.
