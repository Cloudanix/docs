### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, select "Customer managed keys". This will display a list of all the keys that are currently managed by the customer.
3. For each key, check the "Key users" column. If the Secrets Manager is not listed as a user for a key, it means that the Secrets Manager is not in use for that key.
4. Repeat the process for all the keys listed in the "Customer managed keys" section. If none of the keys have the Secrets Manager listed as a user, it indicates that the Secrets Manager is not in use in KMS.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```

   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all KMS keys: Use the following command to list all the KMS keys in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws kms list-keys
   ```

   This command will return a list of all KMS keys along with their key IDs and ARNs.

3. Describe each KMS key: For each KMS key, use the following command to get detailed information about the key:

   ```
   aws kms describe-key --key-id <key-id>
   ```

   Replace `<key-id>` with the ID of the KMS key. This command will return information about the key, including its creation date, description, key state, and key usage.

4. Check if Secrets Manager is in use: In the output of the `describe-key` command, look for the `KeyUsage` field. If the value of this field is `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`, it means that the key is used by AWS Secrets Manager. If the value is `SIGN_VERIFY`, it means that the key is not used by Secrets Manager.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. You can do this using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the AWS client: In your Python script, you need to import the Boto3 library and initialize the AWS client for KMS.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a client
   client = boto3.client('kms')
   ```

3. List all the keys: Use the `list_keys` method to retrieve all the keys in your AWS account.

   ```python
   # List all keys
   response = client.list_keys()

   # Print the keys
   for key in response['Keys']:
       print(key['KeyId'])
   ```

4. Check if Secrets Manager is in use: For each key, use the `list_grants` method to check if the Secrets Manager service is one of the grantees. If the 'GranteePrincipal' field contains 'secretsmanager.amazonaws.com', then the Secrets Manager is in use for that key.

   ```python
   # Check if Secrets Manager is in use
   for key in response['Keys']:
       grants_response = client.list_grants(KeyId=key['KeyId'])
       for grant in grants_response['Grants']:
           if 'secretsmanager.amazonaws.com' in grant['GranteePrincipal']:
               print(f"Secrets Manager is in use for key: {key['KeyId']}")
   ```
   
Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions to list and inspect the keys in your AWS account.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Secrets Manager Should Be In Use" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Secrets Manager service.
3. Click on the "Create secret" button.
4. Select the type of secret you want to create (such as "Other type of secrets").
5. Enter the details for the secret, such as the secret name and the secret value.
6. Click on the "Next" button.
7. Configure the rotation settings for the secret, if applicable.
8. Click on the "Next" button.
9. Review the details of the secret.
10. Click on the "Store" button to create the secret.

Once you have created the secret in AWS Secrets Manager, you can use it in your applications and services to securely store and retrieve sensitive information. Make sure to update your applications and services to use the new secret, and delete any other instances of the sensitive information that may have been stored elsewhere.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of not using Secrets Manager in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. First, create a new Secrets Manager secret for the sensitive data that needs to be stored securely.

2. Then, update the application code to retrieve the sensitive data from Secrets Manager instead of being hardcoded in the code.

3. Next, remove any sensitive data that is currently stored in environment variables or configuration files.

4. Finally, update the IAM policies to grant the necessary permissions to access the Secrets Manager secret.

To create a new Secrets Manager secret using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to create a new secret:

```
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name my-secret --secret-string "my-secret-value"
```

2. Replace `my-secret` with the name of the secret you want to create, and `my-secret-value` with the value of the secret. You can also use the `--secret-file` option to specify a file containing the secret value.

3. Once the secret is created, you can update the application code to retrieve the secret value from Secrets Manager.

4. To remove any sensitive data that is currently stored in environment variables or configuration files, review the code and remove any references to the sensitive data.

5. Finally, update the IAM policies to grant the necessary permissions to access the Secrets Manager secret. You can use the `aws secretsmanager get-secret-value` command to retrieve the secret value, so the IAM policy should include the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` action for the relevant resource.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Secrets Manager Should Be In Use" for AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, ensure that you have the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed on your system.

2. Next, you can use the Boto3 SDK to create a Secrets Manager resource in your AWS account. You can do this by creating a new Secrets Manager client object and using the create_secret method to create a new secret.

Here's some sample Python code that demonstrates how to create a new secret using Boto3:

```python
import boto3

# Create a new Secrets Manager client
client = boto3.client('secretsmanager')

# Create a new secret
response = client.create_secret(
    Name='my-secret',
    SecretString='{"username":"my-username", "password":"my-password"}'
)

# Print the ARN of the new secret
print(response['ARN'])
```

In this example, we're creating a new secret named "my-secret" with a username and password stored as a JSON string in the SecretString field.

3. Once you've created your new secret, you can update your application or infrastructure to use the Secrets Manager client to retrieve the secret values at runtime. This will ensure that your secrets are securely stored and managed by AWS.

Here's some sample Python code that demonstrates how to retrieve a secret using Boto3:

```python
import boto3

# Create a new Secrets Manager client
client = boto3.client('secretsmanager')

# Retrieve the secret value
response = client.get_secret_value(
    SecretId='my-secret'
)

# Print the secret value
print(response['SecretString'])
```

In this example, we're retrieving the value of the "my-secret" secret and printing it to the console.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Secrets Manager Should Be In Use" for AWS using Python and ensure that your secrets are securely managed by AWS.
