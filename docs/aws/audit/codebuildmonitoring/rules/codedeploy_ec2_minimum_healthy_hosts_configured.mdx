### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CodeBuild service.
2. In the CodeBuild dashboard, select the project you want to inspect.
3. In the project details page, navigate to the 'Environment' section. Here, you can see the details of the compute resources being used for the build project.
4. Check the 'Compute' type. If it is set to 'Fleet', then look for the 'Minimum healthy hosts' parameter. This parameter indicates the minimum number of healthy instances that should always be maintained during the build process. If this parameter is not set or is set to a low value, it indicates a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can install AWS CLI using pip (Python package manager) by running the command `pip install awscli`. After installation, you can configure it by running `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all CodeBuild projects: You can list all your AWS CodeBuild projects by running the following command: `aws codebuild list-projects`. This command will return a list of all your CodeBuild project names.

3. Describe CodeBuild project: For each project, you can get more detailed information by running the following command: `aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names project-name`. Replace "project-name" with the name of your project. This command will return a JSON object containing detailed information about the project.

4. Check EC2 Minimum Healthy Hosts Fleet Percentage: In the output of the previous command, look for the "computeType" field under the "environment" object. If the "computeType" is set to "BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL", then the EC2 Minimum Healthy Hosts Fleet Percentage is not maintained because this compute type does not support it. If the "computeType" is set to "BUILD_GENERAL1_LARGE", then the EC2 Minimum Healthy Hosts Fleet Percentage is maintained because this compute type supports it.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. Boto3 allows you to directly create, update, and delete AWS services from your Python scripts.

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS using your access and secret keys.

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Use the `describe_projects` method from the CodeBuild client to get a list of all CodeBuild projects. Then, for each project, use the `batch_get_projects` method to get detailed information about the project, including the configuration for the minimum healthy hosts.

```python
codebuild = session.client('codebuild')

response = codebuild.describe_projects()

for project in response['projects']:
    project_details = codebuild.batch_get_projects(names=[project])
    min_healthy_hosts = project_details['projects'][0]['vpcConfig']['vpcId']
    print(f"Project: {project}, Minimum Healthy Hosts: {min_healthy_hosts}")
```

4. The above script will print out the minimum healthy hosts for each CodeBuild project. If the minimum healthy hosts is not set to the desired value, then it is a misconfiguration. You can adjust the script to raise an exception or send a notification if a misconfiguration is detected.

Please note that you need to replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'` and `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'` with your actual AWS access key and secret key. Also, the region name should be replaced with the region you are working in.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of maintaining the Minimum Healthy Hosts Fleet Percentage for AWS CodeBuild in AWS console, you can follow these steps:

1. **Access AWS CodeBuild Console:**
   - Log in to your AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the AWS CodeBuild service by searching for "CodeBuild" in the search bar.

2. **Select the Project:**
   - In the AWS CodeBuild console, select the project for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

3. **Edit Project Configuration:**
   - Click on the project name to access the project details.
   - Click on the "Edit" button to edit the project configuration.

4. **Update Compute Type:**
   - In the project configuration settings, navigate to the "Environment" section.
   - Under the "Environment image" section, you will find the "Compute type" field.
   - Select a compute type that supports maintaining the Minimum Healthy Hosts Fleet Percentage. For example, choose a compute type that allows you to specify the minimum and maximum number of instances to keep running.

5. **Set Minimum Healthy Hosts Fleet Percentage:**
   - Look for the settings related to the Minimum Healthy Hosts Fleet Percentage or the number of instances to maintain.
   - Update the configuration to specify the desired percentage or number of instances that should be kept healthy at all times.

6. **Save Configuration Changes:**
   - After updating the configuration, scroll down and click on the "Update Project" button to save the changes.

7. **Verify Changes:**
   - Once the project configuration is saved, trigger a build or wait for the next scheduled build to ensure that the changes have taken effect.
   - Monitor the project to ensure that the Minimum Healthy Hosts Fleet Percentage is being maintained as per the updated configuration.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration of maintaining the Minimum Healthy Hosts Fleet Percentage for AWS CodeBuild in the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the EC2 Minimum Healthy Hosts Fleet Percentage misconfiguration for AWS CodeBuild using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the CodeBuild project**: First, identify the CodeBuild project for which you want to remediate the EC2 Minimum Healthy Hosts Fleet Percentage misconfiguration.

2. **Update the CodeBuild project**: Use the AWS CLI command `update-project` to update the CodeBuild project configuration with the desired minimum healthy hosts fleet percentage. Here's an example command to update the CodeBuild project:

```bash
aws codebuild update-project --name <project-name> --environment "computeType=BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL,image=aws/codebuild/standard:4.0,minimumHealthyHosts=50"
```

Replace `<project-name>` with the actual name of your CodeBuild project. In the `environment` parameter, specify the `minimumHealthyHosts` value as per your requirements. In the example command above, it's set to `50`.

3. **Verify the configuration**: After running the `update-project` command, verify the CodeBuild project configuration to ensure that the minimum healthy hosts fleet percentage has been successfully updated. You can use the `describe-projects` command to check the configuration:

```bash
aws codebuild describe-projects --names <project-name>
```

Replace `<project-name>` with the name of your CodeBuild project. Check the output to confirm that the `minimumHealthyHosts` value has been updated to the desired percentage.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the EC2 Minimum Healthy Hosts Fleet Percentage misconfiguration for AWS CodeBuild using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of maintaining the minimum healthy hosts fleet percentage for AWS CodeBuild using Python, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Lambda function**: Create a new Lambda function in the AWS Management Console using Python. This Lambda function will be triggered by CloudWatch Events on a schedule.

2. **Add Lambda function code**: Write Python code in the Lambda function that will check the current status of the CodeBuild project and adjust the minimum healthy hosts fleet percentage if it is not within the desired range. Here is an example code snippet to get you started:

```python
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    codebuild = boto3.client('codebuild')
    
    project_name = 'YOUR_CODEBUILD_PROJECT_NAME'
    desired_percentage = 80  # Set your desired minimum healthy hosts fleet percentage
    
    response = codebuild.batch_get_projects(names=[project_name])
    project = response['projects'][0]
    
    if 'computeType' in project and 'environmentVariables' in project['computeType']:
        for var in project['computeType']['environmentVariables']:
            if var['name'] == 'MIN_HEALTHY_HOSTS_FLEET_PERCENTAGE':
                current_percentage = int(var['value'])
                if current_percentage != desired_percentage:
                    var['value'] = str(desired_percentage)
                    codebuild.update_project(name=project_name, environment={'environmentVariables': project['computeType']['environmentVariables']})
                    print(f"Minimum healthy hosts fleet percentage updated to {desired_percentage}% for {project_name}")
                    break
```

3. **Set up CloudWatch Events trigger**: In the AWS Management Console, create a new CloudWatch Events rule that triggers the Lambda function at a desired schedule (e.g., every hour).

4. **Test the remediation**: Manually trigger the Lambda function to test if it updates the minimum healthy hosts fleet percentage for the specified CodeBuild project.

By following these steps, you can automatically remediate the misconfiguration of maintaining the minimum healthy hosts fleet percentage for AWS CodeBuild using Python and ensure that it stays within the desired range.
