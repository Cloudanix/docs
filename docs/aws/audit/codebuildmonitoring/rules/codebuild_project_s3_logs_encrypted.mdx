### More Info:

This rule ensures that encryption is enabled for logs stored in Amazon S3 for an AWS CodeBuild project. Enabling encryption helps protect sensitive build logs from unauthorized access or tampering. It ensures that logs are encrypted while stored, providing an additional layer of security.

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CodeBuild service.
2. In the navigation pane, select "Build projects". This will display a list of all the CodeBuild projects in your account.
3. Select the CodeBuild project you want to check for S3 Logs encryption. This will open the project details page.
4. In the project details page, navigate to the "Artifacts" section. Here, check if the "Encryption key" field is set to a specific key. If it's set to "AWS Managed Key", it means that the S3 Logs are not encrypted with a customer-managed key, which could be a potential misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the CodeBuild projects in your account using the following command:

   ```
   aws codebuild list-projects
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the CodeBuild project names in your account.

3. For each project, you can describe its details using the following command:

   ```
   aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names project-name
   ```

   Replace 'project-name' with the name of your project. This command will return a JSON object containing the details of the project.

4. To check if the S3 logs of the CodeBuild project are encrypted, you need to look at the 'logsConfig' field in the returned JSON object. If the 'cloudWatchLogs' or 's3Logs' field has 'encryptionDisabled' set to true, then the logs are not encrypted. If the 'encryptionDisabled' field is not present or set to false, then the logs are encrypted.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your local environment. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the AWS CodeBuild service.

```python
pip install boto3
aws configure
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials.

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Use the `CodeBuild` client from boto3 to list all the CodeBuild projects in your account.

```python
codebuild = session.client('codebuild')

response = codebuild.list_projects()

projects = response['projects']
```

4. For each project, get the project details and check if the S3 logs are encrypted. If the `encrypted` field is `False` or the `encryptionKey` field is not present, then the S3 logs are not encrypted.

```python
for project in projects:
    project_details = codebuild.batch_get_projects(names=[project])
    logs_config = project_details['projects'][0]['logsConfig']
    if 's3Logs' in logs_config:
        if not logs_config['s3Logs'].get('encryptionDisabled', False):
            print(f"S3 logs are not encrypted for project: {project}")
```

This script will print out the names of all the CodeBuild projects that have S3 logs not encrypted.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of S3 logs not having encryption enabled for an AWS CodeBuild project, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console and login to your account.

2. **Navigate to AWS CodeBuild**: From the services menu, navigate to AWS CodeBuild by either searching for it or finding it under the Developer Tools category.

3. **Select the CodeBuild Project**: Select the CodeBuild project for which you want to enable S3 log encryption.

4. **Edit CodeBuild Project Settings**:
   - Click on the "Edit" button to modify the settings of the CodeBuild project.

5. **Enable S3 Logs Encryption**:
   - Scroll down to the section where you can configure the S3 logs settings.
   - Look for an option related to S3 log encryption. Enable the encryption option if it's available.
   - If there is no direct option for encryption, you may need to create a new S3 bucket with encryption enabled and update the CodeBuild project to use this new bucket for storing logs.

6. **Save Changes**: Once you have enabled encryption for S3 logs, click on the "Save" or "Update" button to apply the changes to the CodeBuild project.

7. **Verify Encryption**: After saving the changes, trigger a build in the CodeBuild project to generate logs and ensure that the logs are now being stored in an S3 bucket with encryption enabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not having encryption enabled for S3 logs in an AWS CodeBuild project.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of S3 logs not having encryption enabled for an AWS CodeBuild project using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Server-Side Encryption for S3 Bucket**: 
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to enable server-side encryption for the S3 bucket where the CodeBuild project logs are stored:
     ```
     aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket YOUR_BUCKET_NAME --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules":[{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"AES256"}}]}'
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` with the actual name of the S3 bucket where the CodeBuild project logs are stored.

2. **Update CodeBuild Project to Use Encrypted S3 Bucket**:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to update the CodeBuild project to use the encrypted S3 bucket for storing logs:
     ```
     aws codebuild update-project --name YOUR_CODEBUILD_PROJECT_NAME --logs-config '{"cloudWatchLogs":{"status":"DISABLED"},"s3Logs":{"status":"ENABLED","location":"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"}}'
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_CODEBUILD_PROJECT_NAME` with the actual name of the CodeBuild project.
   - Replace `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` with the actual name of the S3 bucket where the CodeBuild project logs are stored.

3. **Verify the Configuration**:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to verify that the encryption is enabled for the S3 bucket and the CodeBuild project is using the encrypted bucket for logs:
     ```
     aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names YOUR_CODEBUILD_PROJECT_NAME
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_CODEBUILD_PROJECT_NAME` with the actual name of the CodeBuild project.

By following these steps, you will successfully remediate the misconfiguration of S3 logs not having encryption enabled for an AWS CodeBuild project using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of S3 logs not having encryption enabled for an AWS CodeBuild project using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Boto3**: Make sure you have the Boto3 library installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Write Python Script**: Create a Python script with the following code to enable encryption for the S3 logs of the CodeBuild project:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize the Boto3 client for S3
   s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

   # Get the bucket name where the CodeBuild project logs are stored
   bucket_name = '<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>'

   # Enable encryption for the bucket
   response = s3_client.put_bucket_encryption(
       Bucket=bucket_name,
       ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration={
           'Rules': [
               {
                   'ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault': {
                       'SSEAlgorithm': 'AES256'
                   }
               }
           ]
       }
   )

   # Print the response
   print(response)
   ```

   Replace `<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>` with the actual bucket name where the CodeBuild project logs are stored.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script to enable encryption for the S3 logs of the CodeBuild project:
   ```bash
   python enable_s3_encryption.py
   ```

4. **Verify**: Check the S3 bucket settings to ensure that encryption is enabled for the CodeBuild project logs.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of S3 logs not having encryption enabled for an AWS CodeBuild project using Python.
