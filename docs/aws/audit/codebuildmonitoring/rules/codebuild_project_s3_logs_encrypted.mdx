<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of S3 logs not having encryption enabled in an AWS CodeBuild project using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create an S3 Bucket with Default Encryption:**
   Ensure that the S3 bucket used for storing CodeBuild logs has default encryption enabled. This can be done by creating a new bucket or updating an existing one.

   ```sh
   aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-codebuild-logs --region us-west-2
   aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket my-codebuild-logs --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules":[{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"AES256"}}]}'
   ```

2. **Create or Update CodeBuild Project with Encrypted Logs:**
   When creating or updating a CodeBuild project, specify the S3 bucket with encryption enabled for storing logs.

   ```sh
   aws codebuild create-project --name my-codebuild-project --source type=GITHUB,location=https://github.com/my-repo/my-project --artifacts type=NO_ARTIFACTS --environment type=LINUX_CONTAINER,image=aws/codebuild/standard:4.0,computeType=BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL --service-role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/codebuild-service-role --logs-config '{"s3Logs": {"status": "ENABLED", "location": "my-codebuild-logs/logs"}}'
   ```

3. **Verify S3 Bucket Encryption:**
   Ensure that the S3 bucket used for logs has encryption enabled by checking its encryption configuration.

   ```sh
   aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket my-codebuild-logs
   ```

4. **Update Existing CodeBuild Project to Use Encrypted S3 Bucket:**
   If you have an existing CodeBuild project, update its log configuration to use the S3 bucket with encryption enabled.

   ```sh
   aws codebuild update-project --name my-codebuild-project --logs-config '{"s3Logs": {"status": "ENABLED", "location": "my-codebuild-logs/logs"}}'
   ```

By following these steps, you ensure that the S3 logs for your CodeBuild project are encrypted, thus preventing the misconfiguration.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize the CodeBuild client
   codebuild_client = boto3.client('codebuild')

   # Define the project name and S3 bucket details
   project_name = 'your-codebuild-project-name'
   s3_bucket_name = 'your-s3-bucket-name'
   s3_bucket_encryption_key = 'your-kms-key-id'  # Optional: Specify a KMS key for encryption

   # Fetch the existing project configuration
   response = codebuild_client.batch_get_projects(names=[project_name])
   project = response['projects'][0]

   # Update the logs configuration to enable encryption
   project['logsConfig'] = {
       's3Logs': {
           'status': 'ENABLED',
           'location': f'{s3_bucket_name}/logs/',
           'encryptionDisabled': False,
           'encryptionKey': s3_bucket_encryption_key  # Optional: Specify a KMS key for encryption
       }
   }

   # Update the CodeBuild project with the new configuration
   response = codebuild_client.update_project(
       name=project_name,
       logsConfig=project['logsConfig']
   )

   print(f"Updated CodeBuild project '{project_name}' to enable S3 log encryption.")
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the Python script to update the CodeBuild project configuration.

   ```bash
   python enable_s3_log_encryption.py
   ```

4. **Verify the Configuration:**
   Check the CodeBuild project in the AWS Management Console or use the AWS CLI to verify that the S3 log encryption is enabled.

   ```bash
   aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names your-codebuild-project-name
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that S3 logs for your CodeBuild project have encryption enabled, thereby preventing the misconfiguration.

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CodeBuild service.
2. In the navigation pane, select "Build projects". This will display a list of all the CodeBuild projects in your account.
3. Select the CodeBuild project you want to check for S3 Logs encryption. This will open the project details page.
4. In the project details page, navigate to the "Artifacts" section. Check if the "Encryption key" field is set to a KMS key. If it's set to "AWS Managed Key" or if the field is empty, then the S3 Logs for the CodeBuild project are not encrypted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Once installed, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all CodeBuild projects: Use the following command to list all the CodeBuild projects in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws codebuild list-projects
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the CodeBuild project names.

3. Describe CodeBuild project: For each project, you need to describe the project to get its details. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names project-name
   ```

   Replace 'project-name' with the name of your CodeBuild project. This command will return a JSON object that contains all the details of the specified CodeBuild project.

4. Check S3 logs encryption: In the returned JSON object, navigate to the `logsConfig` section and check the `s3Logs` field. If the `encryptionDisabled` field is set to `true`, then the S3 logs for the CodeBuild project are not encrypted. If the `encryptionDisabled` field is not present or set to `false`, then the S3 logs are encrypted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) on your local system. Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3 and AWS CodeBuild.

```python
pip install boto3
aws configure
```

2. Create a Python script that uses Boto3 to interact with AWS CodeBuild and AWS S3. The script will list all CodeBuild projects, then for each project, it will check if the S3 logs are encrypted.

```python
import boto3

def check_s3_logs_encryption():
    client = boto3.client('codebuild')
    response = client.list_projects()
    for project in response['projects']:
        project_detail = client.batch_get_projects(names=[project])
        if 'logsConfig' in project_detail['projects'][0]:
            if 's3Logs' in project_detail['projects'][0]['logsConfig']:
                if 'encryptionDisabled' in project_detail['projects'][0]['logsConfig']['s3Logs']:
                    if project_detail['projects'][0]['logsConfig']['s3Logs']['encryptionDisabled']:
                        print(f"Project {project} has S3 logs encryption disabled.")
                    else:
                        print(f"Project {project} has S3 logs encryption enabled.")
                else:
                    print(f"Project {project} does not have S3 logs.")
            else:
                print(f"Project {project} does not have logsConfig.")
        else:
            print(f"Project {project} does not have logsConfig.")

check_s3_logs_encryption()
```

3. Run the Python script. The script will print out the names of the CodeBuild projects and whether they have S3 logs encryption enabled or disabled.

```python
python check_s3_logs_encryption.py
```

4. Review the output. If a project has S3 logs encryption disabled, it means that the logs are not encrypted and the project is misconfigured. If a project does not have S3 logs or does not have a logsConfig, it means that the project is not configured to store logs in S3.
