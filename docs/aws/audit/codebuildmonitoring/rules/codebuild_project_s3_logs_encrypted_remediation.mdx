<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Once installed, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all CodeBuild projects: Use the following command to list all the CodeBuild projects in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws codebuild list-projects
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the CodeBuild project names.

3. Describe CodeBuild project: For each project, you need to describe the project to get its details. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names project-name
   ```

   Replace 'project-name' with the name of your CodeBuild project. This command will return a JSON object that contains all the details of the specified CodeBuild project.

4. Check S3 logs encryption: In the returned JSON object, navigate to the `logsConfig` section and check the `s3Logs` field. If the `encryptionDisabled` field is set to `true`, then the S3 logs for the CodeBuild project are not encrypted. If the `encryptionDisabled` field is not present or set to `false`, then the S3 logs are encrypted.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) on your local system. Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3 and AWS CodeBuild.

```python
pip install boto3
aws configure
```

2. Create a Python script that uses Boto3 to interact with AWS CodeBuild and AWS S3. The script will list all CodeBuild projects, then for each project, it will check if the S3 logs are encrypted.

```python
import boto3

def check_s3_logs_encryption():
    client = boto3.client('codebuild')
    response = client.list_projects()
    for project in response['projects']:
        project_detail = client.batch_get_projects(names=[project])
        if 'logsConfig' in project_detail['projects'][0]:
            if 's3Logs' in project_detail['projects'][0]['logsConfig']:
                if 'encryptionDisabled' in project_detail['projects'][0]['logsConfig']['s3Logs']:
                    if project_detail['projects'][0]['logsConfig']['s3Logs']['encryptionDisabled']:
                        print(f"Project {project} has S3 logs encryption disabled.")
                    else:
                        print(f"Project {project} has S3 logs encryption enabled.")
                else:
                    print(f"Project {project} does not have S3 logs.")
            else:
                print(f"Project {project} does not have logsConfig.")
        else:
            print(f"Project {project} does not have logsConfig.")

check_s3_logs_encryption()
```

3. Run the Python script. The script will print out the names of the CodeBuild projects and whether they have S3 logs encryption enabled or disabled.

```python
python check_s3_logs_encryption.py
```

4. Review the output. If a project has S3 logs encryption disabled, it means that the logs are not encrypted and the project is misconfigured. If a project does not have S3 logs or does not have a logsConfig, it means that the project is not configured to store logs in S3.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of S3 logs not having encryption enabled for an AWS CodeBuild project, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console and login to your account.

2. **Navigate to AWS CodeBuild**: From the services menu, navigate to AWS CodeBuild by either searching for it or finding it under the Developer Tools category.

3. **Select the CodeBuild Project**: Select the CodeBuild project for which you want to enable S3 log encryption.

4. **Edit CodeBuild Project Settings**:
   - Click on the "Edit" button to modify the settings of the CodeBuild project.

5. **Enable S3 Logs Encryption**:
   - Scroll down to the section where you can configure the S3 logs settings.
   - Look for an option related to S3 log encryption. Enable the encryption option if it's available.
   - If there is no direct option for encryption, you may need to create a new S3 bucket with encryption enabled and update the CodeBuild project to use this new bucket for storing logs.

6. **Save Changes**: Once you have enabled encryption for S3 logs, click on the "Save" or "Update" button to apply the changes to the CodeBuild project.

7. **Verify Encryption**: After saving the changes, trigger a build in the CodeBuild project to generate logs and ensure that the logs are now being stored in an S3 bucket with encryption enabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not having encryption enabled for S3 logs in an AWS CodeBuild project.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of S3 logs not having encryption enabled for an AWS CodeBuild project using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Server-Side Encryption for S3 Bucket**: 
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to enable server-side encryption for the S3 bucket where the CodeBuild project logs are stored:
     ```
     aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket YOUR_BUCKET_NAME --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules":[{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"AES256"}}]}'
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` with the actual name of the S3 bucket where the CodeBuild project logs are stored.

2. **Update CodeBuild Project to Use Encrypted S3 Bucket**:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to update the CodeBuild project to use the encrypted S3 bucket for storing logs:
     ```
     aws codebuild update-project --name YOUR_CODEBUILD_PROJECT_NAME --logs-config '{"cloudWatchLogs":{"status":"DISABLED"},"s3Logs":{"status":"ENABLED","location":"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"}}'
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_CODEBUILD_PROJECT_NAME` with the actual name of the CodeBuild project.
   - Replace `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` with the actual name of the S3 bucket where the CodeBuild project logs are stored.

3. **Verify the Configuration**:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to verify that the encryption is enabled for the S3 bucket and the CodeBuild project is using the encrypted bucket for logs:
     ```
     aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names YOUR_CODEBUILD_PROJECT_NAME
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_CODEBUILD_PROJECT_NAME` with the actual name of the CodeBuild project.
