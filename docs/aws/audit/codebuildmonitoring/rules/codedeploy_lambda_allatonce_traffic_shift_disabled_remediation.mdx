### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CodeBuild service.
2. In the navigation pane, select "Build projects". This will display a list of all the build projects in your AWS account.
3. Select the build project that you want to check. This will open the project details page.
4. In the project details page, check the "Environment" section. If the "Compute" field is set to "Use the default settings", it means that the Lambda Compute Platform is using the default deployment configuration.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the CodeBuild projects in your account using the following command:

   ```
   aws codebuild list-projects --region <region-name>
   ```

   Replace `<region-name>` with the name of the AWS region where your CodeBuild projects are located.

3. After getting the list of projects, you can describe each project to get its configuration details. Use the following command:

   ```
   aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names <project-name> --region <region-name>
   ```

   Replace `<project-name>` with the name of your CodeBuild project and `<region-name>` with the name of the AWS region where your CodeBuild project is located.

4. In the output of the above command, look for the "environment" section. If the "computeType" field is set to "BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL", it means that the project is using the default deployment configuration. This could be a potential misconfiguration if the project requires more resources for building.

#### Using Python

To detect if the Lambda Compute Platform is using the default deployment configuration in Code Build, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Setup AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. **List all CodeBuild projects:**
   Use the `list_projects` method to get a list of all CodeBuild projects:

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('codebuild')

   response = client.list_projects()
   ```

3. **Get project details:**
   For each project, use the `batch_get_projects` method to get the details:

   ```python
   for project in response['projects']:
       project_details = client.batch_get_projects(names=[project])
   ```

4. **Check the compute type:**
   Check the compute type of the environment used in the project. If it's set to `BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL`, then it's using the default configuration:

   ```python
   for project in project_details['projects']:
       if project['environment']['computeType'] == 'BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL':
           print(f"Project {project['name']} is using the default deployment configuration.")
   ```

This script will print the names of all projects that are using the default deployment configuration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Lambda Compute Platform using default deployment configuration for AWS CodeBuild in AWS console, follow these steps:

1. **Access AWS CodeBuild Console:**
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS CodeBuild service.

2. **Select the Project:**
   - Select the CodeBuild project that is used for building and deploying the Lambda function.

3. **Edit Build Project:**
   - Click on the project name to access the project details.

4. **Update Buildspec File:**
   - Update the buildspec file to include the necessary configurations for Lambda deployment. Make sure to specify the deployment configurations for Lambda function in the buildspec file.

5. **Update Deployment Configuration:**
   - In the CodeBuild project settings, navigate to the deployment configuration section and ensure that the deployment configuration is set up correctly for Lambda function deployment. You can specify the deployment settings such as the Lambda function name, runtime, handler, memory size, timeout, etc.

6. **Save Changes:**
   - Save the changes made to the CodeBuild project settings.

7. **Trigger Build:**
   - Trigger a new build for the CodeBuild project to deploy the Lambda function with the updated deployment configuration.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Lambda Compute Platform using default deployment configuration for AWS CodeBuild in the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Lambda Compute Platform using default deployment configuration in AWS CodeBuild using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to update the AWS CodeBuild project to ensure that Lambda Compute Platform does not use default deployment configuration:
   
   ```bash
   aws codebuild update-project --name <project-name> --environment type=LINUX_CONTAINER,computeType=BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL,image=aws/codebuild/standard:4.0
   ```
   Replace `<project-name>` with the actual name of your AWS CodeBuild project.

3. This command will update the AWS CodeBuild project's environment settings to use a specific compute type (BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL) and a specific Docker image (aws/codebuild/standard:4.0) which ensures that Lambda Compute Platform does not use default deployment configuration.

4. Once the command is executed successfully, the AWS CodeBuild project will be updated with the remediated configuration.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Lambda Compute Platform using default deployment configuration in AWS CodeBuild using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration where the Lambda Compute Platform is using the default deployment configuration for AWS CodeBuild, you can follow these steps in Python:

1. **Create a CodeBuild Project with Custom Deployment Configuration**:
   
   Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to create a new CodeBuild project with a custom deployment configuration. You can specify the deployment configuration in the `environment` parameter when creating the project.

   ```python
   import boto3

   codebuild = boto3.client('codebuild')

   response = codebuild.create_project(
       name='your-project-name',
       source={
           'type': 'CODEPIPELINE',
           'buildspec': 'buildspec.yml'
       },
       environment={
           'type': 'LINUX_CONTAINER',
           'image': 'aws/codebuild/standard:4.0',
           'computeType': 'BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL',
           'environmentVariables': [
               {
                   'name': 'CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG',
                   'value': 'your-custom-deployment-config'
               }
           ]
       },
       serviceRole='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/codebuild-your-service-role',
       artifacts={
           'type': 'CODEPIPELINE',
       }
   )
   ```

2. **Update Existing CodeBuild Project**:

   If you already have an existing CodeBuild project that is using the default deployment configuration, you can update the project to use a custom deployment configuration.

   ```python
   import boto3

   codebuild = boto3.client('codebuild')

   response = codebuild.update_project(
       name='your-project-name',
       environment={
           'type': 'LINUX_CONTAINER',
           'image': 'aws/codebuild/standard:4.0',
           'computeType': 'BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL',
           'environmentVariables': [
               {
                   'name': 'CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG',
                   'value': 'your-custom-deployment-config'
               }
           ]
       }
   )
   ```

3. **Verify the Deployment Configuration**:

   After creating or updating the CodeBuild project with the custom deployment configuration, verify that the project is using the specified deployment configuration by checking the project settings in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI or SDK.

By following these steps and providing a custom deployment configuration for your Lambda Compute Platform in AWS CodeBuild, you can remediate the misconfiguration and ensure that your Lambda functions are deployed securely and efficiently.
