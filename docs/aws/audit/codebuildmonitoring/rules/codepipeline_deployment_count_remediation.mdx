<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the "CodePipeline Deployment Limit Check Should Be Reviewed in Code Build" misconfiguration using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS CLI:**
   Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions to manage CodePipeline and CodeBuild resources.

   ```sh
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Create or Update CodeBuild Project:**
   When creating or updating a CodeBuild project, specify the `queuedTimeoutInMinutes` parameter to set a limit on how long a build can be queued before it times out.

   ```sh
   aws codebuild create-project --name my-codebuild-project --source type=CODEPIPELINE --artifacts type=CODEPIPELINE --environment type=LINUX_CONTAINER,image=aws/codebuild/standard:4.0,computeType=BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL --service-role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/codebuild-service-role --queued-timeout-in-minutes 30
   ```

   Or, if updating an existing project:

   ```sh
   aws codebuild update-project --name my-codebuild-project --queued-timeout-in-minutes 30
   ```

3. **Set Concurrent Build Limit:**
   Define the maximum number of concurrent builds for the CodeBuild project to prevent resource exhaustion.

   ```sh
   aws codebuild update-project --name my-codebuild-project --concurrent-build-limit 5
   ```

4. **Monitor and Adjust Limits:**
   Regularly monitor the build queue and adjust the `queuedTimeoutInMinutes` and `concurrentBuildLimit` parameters as necessary to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.

   ```sh
   aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names my-codebuild-project
   ```

By following these steps, you can prevent deployment limit issues in CodePipeline by configuring appropriate limits in CodeBuild using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the "CodePipeline Deployment Limit Check Should Be Reviewed in Code Build" misconfiguration using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)**
First, ensure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### 2. **Create a Boto3 Client for CodePipeline and CodeBuild**
Initialize the Boto3 client for interacting with AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild services.

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the CodePipeline client
codepipeline_client = boto3.client('codepipeline')

# Initialize the CodeBuild client
codebuild_client = boto3.client('codebuild')
```

### 3. **Define a Function to Check and Set Deployment Limits**
Create a function to check the current deployment limits and set them to appropriate values if necessary.

```python
def set_deployment_limits(pipeline_name, max_concurrent_builds):
    # Get the current pipeline details
    pipeline = codepipeline_client.get_pipeline(name=pipeline_name)
    
    # Extract the stages from the pipeline
    stages = pipeline['pipeline']['stages']
    
    for stage in stages:
        for action in stage['actions']:
            if action['actionTypeId']['provider'] == 'CodeBuild':
                # Get the project name from the action configuration
                project_name = action['configuration']['ProjectName']
                
                # Get the current project details
                project = codebuild_client.batch_get_projects(names=[project_name])
                
                # Check and set the deployment limits
                if project['projects'][0]['concurrentBuildLimit'] != max_concurrent_builds:
                    codebuild_client.update_project(
                        name=project_name,
                        concurrentBuildLimit=max_concurrent_builds
                    )
                    print(f"Updated deployment limit for project {project_name} to {max_concurrent_builds}")
                else:
                    print(f"Deployment limit for project {project_name} is already set to {max_concurrent_builds}")
```

### 4. **Invoke the Function with Appropriate Parameters**
Call the function with the name of your pipeline and the desired maximum number of concurrent builds.

```python
pipeline_name = 'your-pipeline-name'
max_concurrent_builds = 5  # Set your desired limit here

set_deployment_limits(pipeline_name, max_concurrent_builds)
```

### Summary
1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)**: Install and import Boto3.
2. **Create a Boto3 Client for CodePipeline and CodeBuild**: Initialize the clients.
3. **Define a Function to Check and Set Deployment Limits**: Create a function to check and update deployment limits.
4. **Invoke the Function with Appropriate Parameters**: Call the function with your pipeline name and desired limit.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by following the instructions provided in the AWS CLI User Guide.

2. List all CodePipeline pipelines: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the pipelines in your AWS CodePipeline:

   ```
   aws codepipeline list-pipelines
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the pipelines in your AWS CodePipeline.

3. Describe each pipeline: For each pipeline returned by the previous command, use the following AWS CLI command to get detailed information about the pipeline:

   ```
   aws codepipeline get-pipeline --name <pipeline-name>
   ```
   Replace `<pipeline-name>` with the name of the pipeline you want to inspect. This command will return a JSON object that contains detailed information about the pipeline.

4. Check the deployment limit: In the JSON object returned by the previous command, look for the `limit` field under the `stages` > `actions` > `configuration` > `DeploymentGroupName` path. This field indicates the maximum number of concurrent deployments that can be made by the pipeline. If this field is set to a high value, it may indicate a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your local environment. This will allow you to interact with AWS services including CodePipeline and CodeBuild.

```python
pip install boto3
aws configure
```

2. Create a Python script that uses Boto3 to interact with AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild. The script will list all pipelines, then for each pipeline, it will get the details of each stage and action. If the action type is 'AWS CodeBuild', it will get the project details and check the 'timeoutInMinutes' property.

```python
import boto3

def check_codepipeline_deployment_limit():
    client = boto3.client('codepipeline')

    # List all pipelines
    pipelines = client.list_pipelines()

    for pipeline in pipelines['pipelines']:
        # Get pipeline details
        pipeline_state = client.get_pipeline_state(name=pipeline['name'])

        for stage in pipeline_state['stageStates']:
            for action in stage['actionStates']:
                if action['actionState']['actionName'] == 'AWS CodeBuild':
                    check_codebuild_project(action['actionState']['currentRevision']['revisionId'])

def check_codebuild_project(project_name):
    client = boto3.client('codebuild')

    # Get project details
    project = client.batch_get_projects(names=[project_name])

    # Check 'timeoutInMinutes' property
    if project['projects'][0]['timeoutInMinutes'] > 60:
        print(f"CodeBuild project {project_name} has a timeout limit greater than 60 minutes.")
```

3. Run the Python script. If there are any CodeBuild projects with a 'timeoutInMinutes' property greater than 60 minutes, they will be printed to the console.

```python
check_codepipeline_deployment_limit()
```

4. Regularly run this script to monitor your AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild configurations. You can schedule it to run at regular intervals using a cron job or similar scheduling tool.
