### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodeBuild service.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Build projects". This will display a list of all the CodeBuild projects in your AWS account.

3. Select the CodeBuild project that you want to check for Artifact Encryption.

4. In the project details page, scroll down to the "Artifacts" section. Here, you can see the details of the artifact settings for the selected project.

5. Check the "Encryption key" field. If it is set to "AWS Managed Key", then the artifact encryption is enabled. If it is set to "Customer managed key" and the key is not specified, then the artifact encryption is not enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the CodeBuild projects.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the CodeBuild projects in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws codebuild list-projects
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the CodeBuild project names in your account.

3. To get the details of a specific CodeBuild project, you can use the `batch-get-projects` command followed by the name of the project. For example, if your project name is `my-project`, you can run:

   ```
   aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names "my-project"
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object that contains the details of the specified CodeBuild project.

4. To check if Artifact Encryption is enabled for the CodeBuild project, you need to look for the `encryptionKey` field in the returned JSON object. If this field is present and its value is not `aws/s3`, it means that Artifact Encryption is enabled for the project. If the field is missing or its value is `aws/s3`, it means that Artifact Encryption is not enabled.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your local environment. This will allow you to interact with AWS services including AWS CodeBuild.

```python
pip install boto3
aws configure
```

2. Create a Python script that uses Boto3 to interact with AWS CodeBuild. The script will list all your CodeBuild projects and check if artifact encryption is enabled for each project.

```python
import boto3

def check_artifact_encryption():
    client = boto3.client('codebuild')
    response = client.list_projects()
    
    for project in response['projects']:
        project_details = client.batch_get_projects(names=[project])
        for project in project_details['projects']:
            if 'artifacts' in project:
                if 'encryptionDisabled' in project['artifacts']:
                    if project['artifacts']['encryptionDisabled']:
                        print(f"Artifact encryption is disabled for project: {project['name']}")
                    else:
                        print(f"Artifact encryption is enabled for project: {project['name']}")
                else:
                    print(f"Artifact encryption is enabled for project: {project['name']}")
            else:
                print(f"No artifacts found for project: {project['name']}")

check_artifact_encryption()
```

3. Run the Python script. The script will print out the names of all CodeBuild projects and whether artifact encryption is enabled or disabled for each project.

```python
python check_artifact_encryption.py
```

4. Review the output. If the script prints that artifact encryption is disabled for a project, this indicates a misconfiguration. You should enable artifact encryption for that project to ensure the security of your build artifacts.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of artifact encryption not being enabled for an AWS CodeBuild project, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Open the AWS Management Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/).

2. **Navigate to CodeBuild**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page, then select "CodeBuild" under the Developer Tools section.

3. **Select the CodeBuild Project**: From the CodeBuild dashboard, select the CodeBuild project for which you want to enable artifact encryption by clicking on the project name.

4. **Edit the Project Settings**: In the CodeBuild project details page, click on the "Edit" button in the top right corner to modify the project settings.

5. **Enable Artifact Encryption**: Scroll down to the "Artifacts" section in the project settings, and check the box next to "Encryption". This will enable artifact encryption for the CodeBuild project.

6. **Save the Changes**: After enabling artifact encryption, scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the "Save" button to apply the changes to the CodeBuild project.

7. **Verify Encryption Configuration**: Once the changes are saved, it's a good practice to verify that artifact encryption is indeed enabled for the CodeBuild project. You can do this by running a test build and checking the artifact encryption settings.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of artifact encryption not being enabled for an AWS CodeBuild project using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling artifact encryption for an AWS CodeBuild project using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Enable artifact encryption for the CodeBuild project**:
   
   Run the following AWS CLI command to update the CodeBuild project configuration and enable artifact encryption:
   
   ```bash
   aws codebuild update-project --name <project-name> --encryptionKey <encryption-key-arn> --artifactsEncryptionEnabled true
   ```
   
   Replace `<project-name>` with the name of your CodeBuild project and `<encryption-key-arn>` with the ARN of the KMS key to be used for artifact encryption.

2. **Verify artifact encryption is enabled**:
   
   To confirm that artifact encryption is enabled for the CodeBuild project, you can describe the project using the following AWS CLI command:
   
   ```bash
   aws codebuild describe-projects --names <project-name>
   ```
   
   Ensure that the `artifactsEncryptionEnabled` property is set to `true` in the output.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of enabling artifact encryption for an AWS CodeBuild project using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of artifact encryption not being enabled for an AWS CodeBuild project using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary Python libraries:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Initialize the AWS CodeBuild client:
```python
codebuild_client = boto3.client('codebuild')
```

3. Get the list of existing CodeBuild projects:
```python
response = codebuild_client.list_projects()
projects = response['projects']
```

4. For each project, check if artifact encryption is enabled. If not, update the project configuration to enable artifact encryption:
```python
for project_name in projects:
    project = codebuild_client.batch_get_projects(names=[project_name])['projects'][0]
    
    if not project.get('encryptionKey'):
        project['encryptionKey'] = 'arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/your-kms-key-id'
        
        codebuild_client.update_project(
            name=project_name,
            encryptionKey=project['encryptionKey']
        )
```
Replace `'arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/your-kms-key-id'` with the ARN of the KMS key you want to use for artifact encryption.

5. Run the Python script to enable artifact encryption for all CodeBuild projects that do not have it enabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of artifact encryption not being enabled for an AWS CodeBuild project using Python.
