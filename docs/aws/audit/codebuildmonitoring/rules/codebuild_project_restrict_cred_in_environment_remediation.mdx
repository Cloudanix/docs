<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent plaintext AWS credentials in environment variables for an AWS CodeBuild project using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to CodeBuild:**
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - In the search bar, type "CodeBuild" and select it from the dropdown.

2. **Select the Project:**
   - In the CodeBuild dashboard, locate and select the CodeBuild project you want to configure.

3. **Edit Environment Variables:**
   - In the project details page, click on the "Edit" button.
   - Scroll down to the "Environment" section.
   - Under "Environment variables," ensure that no sensitive information such as AWS credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) is set in plaintext.

4. **Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store:**
   - Instead of setting sensitive information directly in environment variables, use AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
   - Store your credentials in Secrets Manager or Parameter Store and reference them in your buildspec file or through the CodeBuild project configuration.

By following these steps, you can ensure that plaintext AWS credentials are not set in environment variables for your CodeBuild project, enhancing the security of your build environment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent plaintext AWS credentials in environment variables for an AWS CodeBuild project using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create an IAM Role for CodeBuild:**
   Ensure you have an IAM role with the necessary permissions for your CodeBuild project. This role will be used instead of embedding credentials in environment variables.

   ```sh
   aws iam create-role --role-name CodeBuildServiceRole --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
   ```

   The `trust-policy.json` should contain the trust relationship policy allowing CodeBuild to assume the role.

2. **Attach Policies to the IAM Role:**
   Attach the necessary policies to the IAM role to grant it the required permissions.

   ```sh
   aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name CodeBuildServiceRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
   ```

3. **Create or Update the CodeBuild Project Without Plaintext Credentials:**
   When creating or updating the CodeBuild project, specify the IAM role and avoid setting plaintext credentials in environment variables.

   ```sh
   aws codebuild create-project --name MyProject \
   --source type=GITHUB,location=https://github.com/my-repo/my-project \
   --artifacts type=NO_ARTIFACTS \
   --environment type=LINUX_CONTAINER,image=aws/codebuild/standard:4.0,computeType=BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL \
   --service-role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CodeBuildServiceRole
   ```

4. **Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for Sensitive Data:**
   If you need to use sensitive data, store it in AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and reference it in your buildspec file.

   ```sh
   aws secretsmanager create-secret --name MySecret --secret-string '{"username":"myuser","password":"mypassword"}'
   ```

   In your `buildspec.yml`:

   ```yaml
   version: 0.2

   phases:
     build:
       commands:
         - secret=$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id MySecret --query SecretString --output text)
         - echo $secret
   ```

By following these steps, you can prevent the use of plaintext AWS credentials in environment variables for your CodeBuild projects.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent plaintext AWS credentials in environment variables in an AWS CodeBuild project using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to ensure that sensitive information is not stored in plaintext. Here are the steps to achieve this:

### Step 1: Install Boto3
Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

### Step 2: Initialize Boto3 Client
Initialize the Boto3 client for CodeBuild:
```python
import boto3

codebuild_client = boto3.client('codebuild')
```

### Step 3: Create or Update CodeBuild Project Without Plaintext Credentials
When creating or updating a CodeBuild project, ensure that you do not include plaintext credentials in the environment variables. Instead, use AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to manage sensitive information securely.

Here is an example of how to create a CodeBuild project without plaintext credentials:

```python
response = codebuild_client.create_project(
    name='MyCodeBuildProject',
    source={
        'type': 'GITHUB',
        'location': 'https://github.com/my-repo/my-project'
    },
    artifacts={
        'type': 'NO_ARTIFACTS'
    },
    environment={
        'type': 'LINUX_CONTAINER',
        'image': 'aws/codebuild/standard:4.0',
        'computeType': 'BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL',
        'environmentVariables': [
            {
                'name': 'MY_SECRET',
                'value': 'arn:aws:ssm:us-west-2:123456789012:parameter/my-secret',
                'type': 'PARAMETER_STORE'
            }
        ]
    },
    serviceRole='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/codebuild-service-role'
)
```

### Step 4: Validate Configuration
Ensure that the environment variables do not contain plaintext credentials by validating the configuration of the CodeBuild project. You can list the projects and check their environment variables:

```python
projects = codebuild_client.list_projects()

for project_name in projects['projects']:
    project = codebuild_client.batch_get_projects(names=[project_name])
    for env_var in project['projects'][0]['environment']['environmentVariables']:
        if env_var['type'] == 'PLAINTEXT':
            print(f"Warning: Project {project_name} has plaintext environment variable {env_var['name']}")
        else:
            print(f"Project {project_name} environment variable {env_var['name']} is secure")
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that plaintext AWS credentials are not set in the environment variables of your CodeBuild projects, thereby enhancing the security of your AWS environment.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS CodeBuild dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, select "Build projects". This will display a list of all the CodeBuild projects in your AWS account.
3. Select the CodeBuild project you want to inspect for plaintext AWS credentials. This will open the project details page.
4. In the project details page, check the "Environment" section. If the "Environment variables" field contains AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, it means plaintext AWS credentials are set in the environment variables of the CodeBuild project.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the CodeBuild projects in your account using the following command:

   ```
   aws codebuild list-projects --region your-region-name
   ```

   Replace 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region.

3. After getting the list of projects, you can describe each project to get its environment variables. Use the following command:

   ```
   aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names project-name --region your-region-name
   ```

   Replace 'project-name' with the name of your CodeBuild project and 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region.

4. Now, you need to check the 'environmentVariables' section in the output. If you find any AWS credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) in plaintext, it means they are misconfigured. These credentials should not be stored in plaintext in the environment variables.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Import the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and other necessary libraries. Boto3 allows you to directly create, update, and delete AWS resources from your Python scripts.

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import BotoCoreError, ClientError
```

2. Create a session using your AWS credentials. Replace `'us-west-1'` with the region you're working in.

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    region_name='us-west-1'
)
```

3. Create a CodeBuild client from the session.

```python
client = session.client('codebuild')
```

4. List all the CodeBuild projects and check each project's environment variables for plaintext AWS credentials. If found, print the project name.

```python
try:
    response = client.list_projects()
    for project in response['projects']:
        project_details = client.batch_get_projects(names=[project])
        for project in project_details['projects']:
            for env_var in project['environment']['environmentVariables']:
                if 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' in env_var['name'] or 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' in env_var['name']:
                    if env_var['type'] != 'SECRETS_MANAGER':
                        print(f"Plaintext AWS Credentials found in project: {project['name']}")
except (BotoCoreError, ClientError) as error:
    print(f"Error getting CodeBuild projects: {error}")
```

This script will list all the CodeBuild projects in the specified region and check each project's environment variables for plaintext AWS credentials. If it finds any, it will print the project name.
