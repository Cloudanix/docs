1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS CodeBuild dashboard. You can do this by typing "CodeBuild" into the search bar and selecting it from the dropdown menu.
3. In the CodeBuild dashboard, you will see a list of your CodeBuild projects. Click on the name of the project you want to check.
4. In the project details page, scroll down to the "Environment" section. Here, you can see the "Privileged" field. If the value of this field is "true", then Privileged Mode is enabled for this CodeBuild project environment. If the value is "false", then Privileged Mode is not enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the CodeBuild projects.

2. Once the AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can list all the CodeBuild projects in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws codebuild list-projects
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the CodeBuild project names in your account.

3. To get the details of a specific CodeBuild project, you can use the `batch-get-projects` command followed by the name of the project. For example, if your project name is `my-project`, you can run the following command:

   ```
   aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names "my-project"
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object that contains all the details of the specified CodeBuild project.

4. To check if the Privileged Mode is enabled for the project environment, you need to look for the `privilegedMode` field in the `environment` object of the returned JSON. If the `privilegedMode` field is set to `true`, then the Privileged Mode is enabled for the project environment. If the `privilegedMode` field is not present or set to `false`, then the Privileged Mode is not enabled.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To detect if Privileged Mode is enabled in CodeBuild Project Environment using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary modules and create a session:**
   You need to import Boto3 and create a session using your AWS credentials.

   ```python
   import boto3
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='YOUR_REGION'
   )
   ```

2. **Create a CodeBuild client:**
   Use the session to create a CodeBuild client.

   ```python
   codebuild = session.client('codebuild')
   ```

3. **List all CodeBuild projects:**
   Use the `list_projects` method to get a list of all CodeBuild projects.

   ```python
   projects = codebuild.list_projects()['projects']
   ```

4. **Check if Privileged Mode is enabled:**
   For each project, use the `batch_get_projects` method to get the project details and check if Privileged Mode is enabled in the environment.

   ```python
   for project in projects:
       project_details = codebuild.batch_get_projects(names=[project])['projects'][0]
       environment = project_details['environment']
       if 'privilegedMode' in environment and environment['privilegedMode']:
           print(f"Privileged Mode is enabled in project: {project}")
   ```

This script will print the names of all CodeBuild projects where Privileged Mode is enabled. If you want to check for a specific project, you can replace `projects` with a list containing the name of that project.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling Privileged Mode in an AWS CodeBuild project environment, you can follow these step-by-step instructions using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/) and login to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to CodeBuild**: Go to the AWS CodeBuild service by either searching for it in the AWS services search bar or locating it under the "Developer Tools" section.

3. **Select the CodeBuild Project**: From the list of CodeBuild projects, select the project for which you want to enable Privileged Mode.

4. **Edit Project Configuration**: Click on the project name to open the project details page. Then, click on the "Edit" button to edit the project configuration.

5. **Edit Environment Settings**: In the project configuration, navigate to the "Environment" section where you can configure the build environment settings.

6. **Enable Privileged Mode**: Look for the "Privileged mode" option under the "Additional configuration" section within the Environment settings. Toggle the switch to enable Privileged Mode.

7. **Save Changes**: After enabling Privileged Mode, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Update" or "Save" button to save the changes to the CodeBuild project configuration.

8. **Verify Configuration**: Once the changes are saved, you can trigger a new build for the project to verify that Privileged Mode is enabled successfully.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of enabling Privileged Mode in an AWS CodeBuild project environment using the AWS Management Console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling Privileged Mode in an AWS CodeBuild project environment using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

Step 1: Install and configure the AWS CLI
If you haven't already installed the AWS CLI, you can do so by following the instructions provided in the AWS documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html

After installing the AWS CLI, configure it by running the following command and providing your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, AWS Region, and output format:
```
aws configure
```

Step 2: Retrieve the current settings of the CodeBuild project
To retrieve the current settings of the CodeBuild project, use the following AWS CLI command:
```
aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names <project-name>
```
Replace `<project-name>` with the name of your CodeBuild project.

Step 3: Update the CodeBuild project to enable Privileged Mode
To enable Privileged Mode in the CodeBuild project environment, use the following AWS CLI command:
```
aws codebuild update-project --name <project-name> --environment privilegedMode=true
```
Replace `<project-name>` with the name of your CodeBuild project.

Step 4: Verify the changes
To verify that the Privileged Mode has been successfully enabled in the CodeBuild project environment, you can re-run the `batch-get-projects` command from Step 2.

After following these steps, the Privileged Mode should be enabled in the AWS CodeBuild project environment, and the misconfiguration should be remediated.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling privileged mode for an AWS CodeBuild project environment using Python, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) if you haven't already. You can refer to the official documentation for installation instructions: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html

Step 2: Use the following Python script to update the CodeBuild project configuration to enable privileged mode:

```python
import boto3

# Specify the CodeBuild project name and the AWS region
project_name = 'YOUR_CODEBUILD_PROJECT_NAME'
region = 'YOUR_AWS_REGION'

# Create a CodeBuild client
codebuild_client = boto3.client('codebuild', region_name=region)

# Get the current project settings
project_details = codebuild_client.batch_get_projects(names=[project_name])

# Update the project settings to enable privileged mode
project_details['projects'][0]['environment']['privilegedMode'] = True

# Update the CodeBuild project with the new configuration
codebuild_client.update_project(
    name=project_name,
    environment=project_details['projects'][0]['environment']
)

print(f"Privileged mode has been enabled for the CodeBuild project: {project_name}")
```

Step 3: Replace 'YOUR_CODEBUILD_PROJECT_NAME' and 'YOUR_AWS_REGION' with your actual CodeBuild project name and AWS region in the Python script.

Step 4: Run the Python script in your local environment or any Python supported environment. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to update the CodeBuild project configuration.

After running the script, the privileged mode should be enabled for the specified CodeBuild project in AWS. You can verify the changes by checking the CodeBuild project configuration in the AWS Management Console.
