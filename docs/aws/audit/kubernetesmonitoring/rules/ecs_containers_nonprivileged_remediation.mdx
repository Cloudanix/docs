### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent ECS Tasks from being configured to run as non-privileged in Kubernetes using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to ECS Cluster:**
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the ECS service by searching for "ECS" in the search bar.
   - Select the ECS cluster where your tasks are running.

2. **Edit Task Definition:**
   - In the ECS cluster, go to the "Task Definitions" tab.
   - Select the task definition you want to modify.
   - Click on the "Create new revision" button to edit the task definition.

3. **Configure Container Definitions:**
   - In the task definition, scroll down to the "Container Definitions" section.
   - Select the container you want to configure.
   - Scroll down to the "Security" section within the container configuration.

4. **Set Non-Privileged Mode:**
   - Ensure that the "Privileged" checkbox is unchecked. This ensures that the container does not run in privileged mode.
   - Save the changes and create the new revision of the task definition.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your ECS tasks are configured to run as non-privileged, enhancing the security of your Kubernetes environment on AWS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent ECS tasks from running as privileged in Kubernetes using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Kubernetes Pod Security Policy (PSP):**
   Ensure that you have a Pod Security Policy that restricts the use of privileged containers. This policy will prevent any pod from running with elevated privileges.

   ```sh
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
   kind: PodSecurityPolicy
   metadata:
     name: restricted-psp
   spec:
     privileged: false
     allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
     runAsUser:
       rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot'
     seLinux:
       rule: 'RunAsAny'
     supplementalGroups:
       rule: 'MustRunAs'
       ranges:
       - min: 1
         max: 65535
     fsGroup:
       rule: 'MustRunAs'
       ranges:
       - min: 1
         max: 65535
   EOF
   ```

2. **Create a ClusterRole for the PSP:**
   Create a ClusterRole that grants access to use the Pod Security Policy.

   ```sh
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: ClusterRole
   metadata:
     name: psp-user
   rules:
   - apiGroups: ['policy']
     resources: ['podsecuritypolicies']
     verbs: ['use']
     resourceNames: ['restricted-psp']
   EOF
   ```

3. **Bind the ClusterRole to a ServiceAccount:**
   Bind the ClusterRole to a ServiceAccount that your ECS tasks will use. This ensures that the tasks adhere to the Pod Security Policy.

   ```sh
   kubectl create serviceaccount ecs-task-sa
   kubectl create clusterrolebinding ecs-task-psp-binding --clusterrole=psp-user --serviceaccount=default:ecs-task-sa
   ```

4. **Configure ECS Task Definition to Use the ServiceAccount:**
   When defining your ECS task, ensure that it uses the ServiceAccount created in the previous step. This can be done by specifying the `serviceAccountName` in your pod spec.

   ```sh
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: ecs-task-pod
   spec:
     serviceAccountName: ecs-task-sa
     containers:
     - name: ecs-task-container
       image: your-ecs-task-image
       securityContext:
         runAsUser: 1000
         runAsNonRoot: true
         allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
   EOF
   ```

By following these steps, you ensure that your ECS tasks are configured to run as non-privileged in Kubernetes using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent ECS tasks from running as privileged in Kubernetes using Python scripts, you can use the Kubernetes Python client library to ensure that the security context of your pods and containers is set correctly. Below are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Install Kubernetes Python Client:**
   First, you need to install the Kubernetes Python client library if you haven't already.

   ```bash
   pip install kubernetes
   ```

2. **Load Kubernetes Configuration:**
   Load the Kubernetes configuration to interact with the cluster. This can be done using the `config` module from the Kubernetes client.

   ```python
   from kubernetes import client, config

   # Load the kubeconfig file
   config.load_kube_config()
   ```

3. **Define the Security Context:**
   Create a security context that ensures the container is not running as privileged.

   ```python
   security_context = client.V1SecurityContext(
       privileged=False
   )
   ```

4. **Create or Update Pod Specification:**
   Apply the security context to your pod or container specification. Here is an example of how to create a pod with the non-privileged security context.

   ```python
   # Define the container with the security context
   container = client.V1Container(
       name="my-container",
       image="my-image",
       security_context=security_context
   )

   # Define the pod spec
   pod_spec = client.V1PodSpec(
       containers=[container]
   )

   # Define the pod metadata
   metadata = client.V1ObjectMeta(
       name="my-pod"
   )

   # Define the pod
   pod = client.V1Pod(
       api_version="v1",
       kind="Pod",
       metadata=metadata,
       spec=pod_spec
   )

   # Create the pod in the specified namespace
   api_instance = client.CoreV1Api()
   namespace = "default"
   api_instance.create_namespaced_pod(namespace=namespace, body=pod)
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your ECS tasks in Kubernetes are configured to run as non-privileged using Python scripts. This approach helps in preventing potential security risks associated with running containers in privileged mode.

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the ECS (Elastic Container Service) section.

2. In the ECS section, select the cluster where your Kubernetes services are running.

3. Select the task definition that you want to inspect. Task definitions are the blueprint of your application and contain settings like which Docker image to use, how much CPU and memory to allocate, etc.

4. In the task definition details, look for the "User" field under the "Docker Labels" section. If this field is not set or is set to "root", then the task is running as a privileged user.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will need to provide your AWS access key ID, secret access key, default region name, and default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the running ECS tasks in your AWS account using the following command:

   ```
   aws ecs list-tasks --cluster <cluster-name>
   ```

   Replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of your ECS cluster. This command will return a list of task ARNs.

3. For each task ARN in the list, describe the task to get more information about it. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster <cluster-name> --tasks <task-arn>
   ```

   Replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of your ECS cluster and `<task-arn>` with the ARN of the task. This command will return a JSON object that contains information about the task.

4. In the returned JSON object, look for the "containerDefinitions" section. This section contains a list of container definitions for the task. For each container definition, check the "privileged" field. If this field is set to true, then the container is running as privileged. If it's set to false or not present, then the container is running as non-privileged.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Import the necessary libraries in Python. You will need the Kubernetes client library to interact with the Kubernetes API.

```python
from kubernetes import client, config
```

2. Load the Kubernetes configuration. This can be done in two ways: either from a kubeconfig file or from within a Pod. The kubeconfig file is usually located at `~/.kube/config`.

```python
config.load_kube_config()
```

3. Create an instance of the `CoreV1Api` class, which provides methods for interacting with the core V1 Kubernetes API.

```python
v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
```

4. Iterate over all the Pods in the cluster and check the security context of each container. If the `runAsNonRoot` field is not set to `True`, then the container is running as a privileged user.

```python
def check_privileged_pods():
    ret = v1.list_pod_for_all_namespaces(watch=False)
    for i in ret.items:
        for j in i.spec.containers:
            if j.security_context is None or j.security_context.run_as_non_root is None or not j.security_context.run_as_non_root:
                print("Pod {} in namespace {} is running as a privileged user".format(i.metadata.name, i.metadata.namespace))

check_privileged_pods()
```

This script will print out the names and namespaces of all Pods that are running as a privileged user. If no such Pods exist, it will not print anything.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks running as privileged in AWS Kubernetes using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. List the ECS tasks that are running as privileged:
```
aws ecs list-tasks --cluster <cluster-name> --query 'taskArns[]' --output text | xargs -I {} aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster <cluster-name> --tasks {} --query 'tasks[?containers[?privileged==`true`]].taskArn' --output text
```

2. Update the ECS task definition to set the `privileged` parameter to `false` for each container in the task definition. You can do this by updating the task definition JSON file and then registering the new task definition.

3. Update the task definition JSON file to set `privileged` to `false`. Here is an example of how to update the JSON file:

```json
{
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "your-container-name",
      "image": "your-image",
      "privileged": false,
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

4. Register the updated task definition:
```
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://updated-task-definition.json
```

5. Update the ECS service to use the new task definition:
```
aws ecs update-service --cluster <cluster-name> --service <service-name> --task-definition <new-task-definition-arn>
```

6. Verify that the ECS tasks are now running as non-privileged:
```
aws ecs list-tasks --cluster <cluster-name> --query 'taskArns[]' --output text | xargs -I {} aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster <cluster-name> --tasks {} --query 'tasks[?containers[?privileged==`true`]].taskArn' --output text
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks running as privileged in AWS Kubernetes using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks running as privileged in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ECS Task Definition**: First, you need to identify the ECS Task Definition that is running as privileged. You can do this by listing all the existing task definitions and inspecting their configurations.

2. **Update the Task Definition**: You will need to update the task definition to run as non-privileged. You can achieve this by modifying the task definition JSON and setting the `privileged` parameter to `false`.

3. **Use Boto3 Library**: Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python, which allows you to interact with AWS services. You can use Boto3 to describe the existing task definitions, update the task definition, and register the updated task definition.

4. **Python Script**: Below is a sample Python script that demonstrates how to remediate the misconfiguration by updating the ECS task definition to run as non-privileged:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the ECS client
ecs_client = boto3.client('ecs')

# Specify the task definition ARN that needs to be updated
task_definition_arn = 'YOUR_TASK_DEFINITION_ARN'

# Describe the task definition to get the current configuration
response = ecs_client.describe_task_definition(taskDefinition=task_definition_arn)
task_definition = response['taskDefinition']

# Update the task definition to run as non-privileged
task_definition['containerDefinitions'][0]['linuxParameters']['capabilities']['add'] = ['SYS_PTRACE']

# Register the updated task definition
response = ecs_client.register_task_definition(
    family=task_definition['family'],
    taskRoleArn=task_definition['taskRoleArn'],
    executionRoleArn=task_definition['executionRoleArn'],
    networkMode=task_definition['networkMode'],
    containerDefinitions=task_definition['containerDefinitions']
)

print("Task Definition updated successfully to run as non-privileged.")
```

5. **Execute the Script**: Save the above script in a Python file (e.g., `update_task_definition.py`) and execute it in your Python environment. Make sure you have the necessary AWS credentials configured for the Boto3 client to interact with ECS.

By following these steps and running the Python script, you can remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks running as privileged in AWS and update them to run as non-privileged.
