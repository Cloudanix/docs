### More Info:

Ensures ECR repository image tags cannot be overwritten. ECR repositories should be configured to prevent overwriting of image tags to avoid potentially-malicious images from being deployed to live environments.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Elastic Container Registry (ECR) service.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Repositories". This will display a list of all your ECR repositories.

3. Click on the name of the repository you want to check. This will take you to the repository details page.

4. In the repository details page, under the "Image tags" section, check if the "Immutable" option is enabled. If it is not, then the ECR Repository Tag is not set to be immutable.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the ECR repositories.

2. Once the AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can list all the ECR repositories in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ecr describe-repositories
   ```
   This command will return a JSON object with all the repositories in your account.

3. To check if a specific repository has immutable tags enabled, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws ecr describe-repositories --repository-names <repository-name>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-name>` with the name of the repository you want to check. This command will return a JSON object with the details of the specified repository.

4. In the returned JSON object, look for the "imageTagMutability" field. If the value of this field is "MUTABLE", then the repository does not have immutable tags enabled. If the value is "IMMUTABLE", then the repository has immutable tags enabled.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS services. Install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to interact with AWS services. You can set them in your environment variables:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check the ECR repository tag immutability: Here is a simple Python script that uses Boto3 to check if the ECR repository tag is immutable:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_ecr_repo_tag_immutability():
       client = boto3.client('ecr')
       response = client.describe_repositories()
       for repo in response['repositories']:
           repo_name = repo['repositoryName']
           immutability_config = client.get_image_tag_mutability(repositoryName=repo_name)
           if immutability_config['imageTagMutability'] != 'IMMUTABLE':
               print(f"ECR Repository {repo_name} tag is not immutable")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_ecr_repo_tag_immutability()
   ```

4. Run the Python script: You can run the Python script from your terminal:

   ```bash
   python check_ecr_repo_tag_immutability.py
   ```

This script will print the names of all ECR repositories whose tag is not immutable. If no such repositories are found, it will not print anything.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "ECR Repository Tag Should Be Immutable" for AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose the repository that you want to remediate.
3. Choose the "Image tags" tab.
4. Choose the tag that you want to make immutable.
5. Choose "Actions", and then choose "Edit tag immutability".
6. Choose "Immutable", and then choose "Save".

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "ECR Repository Tag Should Be Immutable" for AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "ECR Repository Tag Should Be Immutable" in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to create a new ECR repository policy with the rule "ecr:PutImageTagMutability" set to "IMMUTABLE". You can use the following AWS CLI command to create a new ECR repository policy:

```
aws ecr set-repository-policy --repository-name <REPOSITORY_NAME> --policy-text '{"rules": [{"rulePriority": 1,"description": "ECR Repository Tag Should Be Immutable","selection": {"tagStatus": "tagged","tagPrefixList": ["latest"]},"action": {"type": "tagMutability","mutability": "IMMUTABLE"}}]}'
```

Note: Replace `<REPOSITORY_NAME>` with the name of the ECR repository you want to update.

2. Once the new ECR repository policy is created, you need to update the existing ECR repository with the new policy. You can use the following AWS CLI command to update the ECR repository:

```
aws ecr put-image-tag-mutability --repository-name <REPOSITORY_NAME> --image-tag-mutability IMMUTABLE
```

Note: Replace `<REPOSITORY_NAME>` with the name of the ECR repository you want to update.

3. After running the above commands, the ECR repository's tags will be immutable, and no new tags can be created or updated. Any attempt to create or update a tag will result in an error.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "ECR Repository Tag Should Be Immutable" in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of ECR Repository Tag Should Be Immutable in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Create a boto3 ECR client object:

```python
import boto3

ecr_client = boto3.client('ecr')
```

3. Get the list of images in the ECR repository:

```python
repository_name = 'my-ecr-repo'
image_list = ecr_client.list_images(repositoryName=repository_name)['imageIds']
```

4. Iterate through the image list and set the image tag as immutable:

```python
for image in image_list:
    image_digest = image['imageDigest']
    response = ecr_client.put_image_tag_mutability(
        repositoryName=repository_name,
        imageTag=image['imageTag'],
        imageDigest=image_digest,
        imageTagMutability='IMMUTABLE'
    )
```

5. Verify that the tag mutability is set to immutable:

```python
image_detail = ecr_client.describe_images(repositoryName=repository_name, imageIds=[{'imageDigest': image_digest}])['imageDetails'][0]
print(image_detail['imageTags'][0])
print(image_detail['imageTagMutability'])
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of ECR Repository Tag Should Be Immutable in AWS using Python.
