### More Info:

Your Amazon EKS cluster API server endpoints should not be publicly accessible from the Internet in order to avoid exposing private data and minimizing security risks. The level of access to your Kubernetes API server endpoints depends on your EKS application use cases. It is recommended that the API server endpoints should be accessible only from within your AWS VPC.

### Risk Level

Low

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

HITRUST, CISEKS, SOC2, NISTCSF, PCIDSS

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EKS service.
2. In the left navigation pane, choose "Clusters" to access the list of your EKS clusters.
3. Click on the name of the cluster that you want to examine. This will open the cluster's details page.
4. In the "Cluster details" section, look for the "Endpoint public access" setting. If this setting is enabled, it means that the Kubernetes API server endpoint is publicly accessible.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all the Kubernetes clusters: Use the following command to list all the Kubernetes clusters in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws eks list-clusters
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the EKS clusters in your account.

3. Describe the Kubernetes cluster: For each cluster, use the following command to get detailed information about the cluster:

   ```
   aws eks describe-cluster --name <cluster-name>
   ```
   Replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of your cluster. This command will return a JSON object that contains information about the cluster.

4. Check the endpoint accessibility: In the output of the previous command, look for the `endpointPublicAccess` field. If this field is set to `true`, then the endpoint is publicly accessible. If it is set to `false`, then the endpoint is not publicly accessible.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: You will need the Kubernetes Python client to interact with the Kubernetes API. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install kubernetes
```

2. Connect to the Kubernetes API: You will need to authenticate with the Kubernetes API. This can be done using a kubeconfig file or by using the in-cluster configuration if the script is running inside a pod.

```python
from kubernetes import client, config

# Load the kubeconfig file
config.load_kube_config()

# Create an API client
v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
```

3. Query the Kubernetes API for services: You can use the list_service_for_all_namespaces method to get a list of all services in all namespaces. 

```python
services = v1.list_service_for_all_namespaces()
```

4. Check the type of each service: If the type of a service is LoadBalancer, it is publicly accessible. You can check this by iterating over the services and checking the type of each one.

```python
for service in services.items:
    if service.spec.type == 'LoadBalancer':
        print(f"Service {service.metadata.name} in namespace {service.metadata.namespace} is publicly accessible")
```

This script will print the names and namespaces of all services that are publicly accessible. You can modify it to suit your needs, for example by writing the results to a file or sending an alert if any publicly accessible services are found.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions on how to remediate the "Endpoints Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the Amazon VPC service.
3. Click on "Endpoints" in the left navigation pane.
4. Select the endpoint that you want to remediate.
5. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Modify Endpoint".
6. In the "Modify Endpoint" dialog box, select the "Private" option for the endpoint.
7. Click "Save Changes" to apply the changes.

After following these steps, the endpoint will no longer be publicly accessible and will only be accessible through the VPC.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all VPC endpoints in your AWS account:

```
aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoints
```

3. Identify the VPC endpoint that is publicly accessible.

4. Run the following command to modify the VPC endpoint to make it not publicly accessible:

```
aws ec2 modify-vpc-endpoint --vpc-endpoint-id <VPC_ENDPOINT_ID> --no-public-dns-enabled --policy-document '{"Statement":[{"Effect":"Deny","Principal":"*","Action":"*","Resource":"*"}],"Version":"2012-10-17"}'
```

Replace `<VPC_ENDPOINT_ID>` with the ID of the VPC endpoint that you identified in step 3.

5. Verify that the VPC endpoint is no longer publicly accessible by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoints --vpc-endpoint-ids <VPC_ENDPOINT_ID>
```

This command should return an output that includes `"PrivateDnsEnabled": true` and `"PolicyDocument": {"Statement": [{"Effect": "Deny", "Principal": "*", "Action": "*", "Resource": "*"}], "Version": "2012-10-17"}` for the VPC endpoint that you modified.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for any other publicly accessible VPC endpoints in your AWS account.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Endpoints Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" for AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Identify the endpoints that are publicly accessible. You can use the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 describe-security-groups` to list all security groups and their associated rules.

2. For each security group that has a rule allowing public access to an endpoint, you will need to remove the rule. You can use the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress` to remove the rule.

3. To automate this process using Python, you can use the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here is an example code snippet that will remove all rules allowing public access to endpoints for a specific security group:

```python
import boto3

# Replace <security-group-id> with the actual ID of the security group
security_group_id = '<security-group-id>'

# Create an EC2 client
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Describe the security group to get its current rules
response = ec2.describe_security_groups(GroupIds=[security_group_id])
security_group = response['SecurityGroups'][0]

# Remove all rules allowing public access to endpoints
for rule in security_group['IpPermissions']:
    if rule['IpRanges'][0]['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
        ec2.revoke_security_group_ingress(
            GroupId=security_group_id,
            IpPermissions=[rule]
        )
```

4. You can run this Python script as a Lambda function and schedule it to run periodically to ensure that any new endpoints that are publicly accessible are remediated automatically. You can also modify the script to remediate all security groups in your AWS account, not just a specific one.
