       )
       latest_version = response['taskDefinition']['requiresCompatibilities'][0]
       return latest_version

   latest_version = get_latest_fargate_platform_version()
   print(f"Latest Fargate Platform Version: {latest_version}")
   ```

4. **Update Kubernetes Deployment with Latest Fargate Platform Version**:
   Ensure your Kubernetes deployment is using the latest ECS Fargate platform version.

   ```python
   def update_k8s_deployment_with_latest_version(deployment_name, namespace):
       # Fetch the deployment
       deployment = k8s_client.read_namespaced_deployment(deployment_name, namespace)

       # Update the deployment spec with the latest Fargate platform version
       for container in deployment.spec.template.spec.containers:
           if 'ecs-fargate-platform-version' in container.env:
               for env_var in container.env:
                   if env_var.name == 'ecs-fargate-platform-version':
                       env_var.value = latest_version
                       break
           else:
               container.env.append(client.V1EnvVar(
                   name='ecs-fargate-platform-version',
                   value=latest_version
               ))

       # Apply the updated deployment
       k8s_client.patch_namespaced_deployment(
           name=deployment_name,
           namespace=namespace,
           body=deployment
       )

   update_k8s_deployment_with_latest_version('your-deployment-name', 'your-namespace')
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Kubernetes deployments are always using the latest ECS Fargate platform version, thus preventing the misconfiguration.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can run any AWS CLI commands, you need to install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided in the AWS CLI User Guide.

2. List all the ECS clusters: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the ECS clusters in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws ecs list-clusters --region your-region
   ```

   Replace 'your-region' with the AWS region where your ECS clusters are located.

3. Describe the ECS clusters: For each cluster listed in the previous step, use the following AWS CLI command to describe the cluster and get information about the Fargate platform version.

   ```
   aws ecs describe-clusters --clusters your-cluster-name --region your-region
   ```

   Replace 'your-cluster-name' with the name of your ECS cluster and 'your-region' with the AWS region where your ECS cluster is located.

4. Check the Fargate platform version: In the output of the previous command, look for the 'platformVersion' field. This field indicates the Fargate platform version that is set for the ECS cluster. If the 'platformVersion' field is not set to 'LATEST', then the ECS Fargate platform version is not set to the latest version.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the boto3 library. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials: Before you can interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by running `aws configure` in your terminal and following the prompts.

3. Write a Python script to check the ECS Fargate platform version:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a low-level service client
   client = boto3.client('ecs')

   # Call describe_services to get the details of the services
   response = client.describe_services(
       cluster='default',
       services=[
           'service-name',
       ]
   )

   # Extract the platform version from the response
   platform_version = response['services'][0]['taskDefinition']['compatibilities'][0]

   # Print the platform version
   print(f'Platform version: {platform_version}')
   ```

   Replace `'service-name'` with the name of your service. This script will print the platform version of the specified service.

4. Analyze the output: If the platform version is not the latest, then there is a misconfiguration. The latest platform version for ECS Fargate is 1.4.0. If the printed platform version is less than this, then the ECS Fargate platform version is not set to the latest version.
