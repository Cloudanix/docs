### More Info:

This rule checks if Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters are configured to have Kubernetes secrets encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys. It is marked as COMPLIANT if an EKS cluster has an encryptionConfig with secrets as one of the resources. It is also marked as COMPLIANT if the key used to encrypt EKS secrets matches with the parameter. It is marked as NON_COMPLIANT if an EKS cluster does not have an encryptionConfig or if the encryptionConfig resources do not include secrets. Additionally, it is marked as NON_COMPLIANT if the key used to encrypt EKS secrets does not match with the parameter.

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EKS service.
2. In the left navigation pane, select "Clusters" to open the list of available EKS clusters.
3. Select the EKS cluster that you want to examine for secret encryption.
4. In the cluster details page, look for the "Secrets encryption" field. If the field is set to "Disabled", then the EKS cluster does not have secrets encryption enabled. If it's set to "Enabled", then the cluster has secrets encryption enabled.
5. Repeat the process for each EKS cluster in your AWS account.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the EKS clusters.

2. List all the EKS clusters in your account using the following command:
   ```
   aws eks list-clusters
   ```
   This command will return a list of all EKS clusters in your account.

3. For each cluster, describe the cluster to get the details about the cluster configuration. Use the following command:
   ```
   aws eks describe-cluster --name <cluster-name>
   ```
   Replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of your cluster. This command will return a JSON output with the details of the cluster configuration.

4. In the JSON output, look for the `encryptionConfig` field. If the `resources` field includes `secrets`, and the `provider` field includes a KMS key, then the encryption of secrets is enabled. If not, then it is not enabled. The `encryptionConfig` field should look something like this if the encryption of secrets is enabled:
   ```
   "encryptionConfig": [
       {
           "resources": ["secrets"],
           "provider": {
               "keyArn": "arn:aws:kms:<region>:<account-id>:key/<key-id>"
           }
       }
   ]
   ```
   Replace `<region>`, `<account-id>`, and `<key-id>` with your actual AWS region, account ID, and KMS key ID.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: You will need the boto3 library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Configure your AWS credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. You can configure it in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

3. Write a Python script to check the EKS clusters encryption of secrets:

```python
import boto3

def check_eks_encryption():
    client = boto3.client('eks')
    clusters = client.list_clusters()['clusters']
    for cluster in clusters:
        response = client.describe_cluster(name=cluster)
        resources_vpc_config = response['cluster']['resourcesVpcConfig']
        if 'endpointPublicAccess' in resources_vpc_config and resources_vpc_config['endpointPublicAccess']:
            print(f"Cluster {cluster} has public access enabled.")
        else:
            print(f"Cluster {cluster} has public access disabled.")

check_eks_encryption()
```

This script lists all your EKS clusters and checks if they have public access enabled. If they do, it prints a message with the cluster's name.

4. Run the script: You can run the script using any Python interpreter. Make sure to set your AWS credentials before running the script. If the script prints any messages, it means that those clusters have public access enabled, which is a misconfiguration.

Please note that this script only checks for public access. It doesn't check if the secrets are encrypted or not. To do that, you would need to use the Kubernetes API, which is beyond the scope of this question.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of EKS clusters encryption of secrets not being enabled in AWS Kubernetes using the AWS console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console at https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to Amazon EKS service**: In the AWS Management Console, search for "EKS" in the search bar or navigate to the "Services" dropdown menu and select "Elastic Kubernetes Service".

3. **Select your EKS cluster**: From the list of available EKS clusters, select the cluster for which you want to enable encryption of secrets.

4. **Click on the cluster name**: Click on the name of the EKS cluster to access the cluster details and configuration.

5. **Navigate to Cluster Settings**: In the cluster details page, navigate to the "Configuration" tab or "Cluster Settings" section.

6. **Edit Encryption Configuration**: Look for the encryption configuration settings or secrets encryption settings. Click on the "Edit" button or similar option to edit the encryption configuration.

7. **Enable Encryption of Secrets**: In the encryption configuration settings, enable the option for encryption of secrets. This setting ensures that all secrets stored in the EKS cluster are encrypted at rest.

8. **Save Changes**: Once you have enabled encryption of secrets, make sure to save the changes by clicking on the "Save" or "Update" button.

9. **Verify Encryption Configuration**: After saving the changes, verify that encryption of secrets is now enabled for the EKS cluster. You can check the encryption status in the cluster details or configuration settings.

10. **Monitor Encryption Status**: Keep an eye on the encryption status regularly to ensure that secrets are always encrypted at rest in the EKS cluster.

By following these steps, you will successfully remediate the misconfiguration of EKS clusters encryption of secrets not being enabled in AWS Kubernetes using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of EKS Clusters Encryption of Secrets not being enabled in AWS Kubernetes using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:
