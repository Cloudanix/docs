1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the ECS (Elastic Container Service) section.

2. In the ECS section, select the cluster where your tasks are running.

3. Once you've selected the cluster, navigate to the "Tasks" tab. Here, you will see a list of all the tasks running in the selected cluster.

4. Click on the task you want to inspect. In the task detail page, look for the "Task Definition" section. Click on the task definition name to view its details. In the task definition details, check the "PidMode" parameter. If it is set to "host", then the ECS task has a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the ECS task definitions in your account using the following command:

   ```
   aws ecs list-task-definitions --region your-region-name
   ```

   Replace "your-region-name" with the name of the AWS region where your ECS tasks are running.

3. After getting the list of task definitions, you can describe each task definition to check its PidMode. Use the following command to describe a task definition:

   ```
   aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition task-definition-arn --region your-region-name
   ```

   Replace "task-definition-arn" with the ARN of the task definition you want to check, and "your-region-name" with the name of your AWS region.

4. The output of the above command will include a "pidMode" field. If the value of this field is "host", then the ECS task has PidMode as host. If the "pidMode" field is not present or its value is not "host", then the ECS task does not have PidMode as host.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if ECS Tasks have PidMode set as Host in Kubernetes using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Boto3:**
   Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:
   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:**
   Before you can begin to use the Boto3 SDK with your AWS account, you need to set up authentication credentials. Credentials for your AWS account can be found in the IAM Console. You can create or use an existing user. Go to manage access keys and generate a new set of keys.
   ```python
   aws configure
   AWS Access Key ID [None]: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   Default region name [None]: YOUR_REGION_NAME
   Default output format [None]: json
   ```

3. **Create a Python Script:**
   You can use the Boto3 SDK to create a Python script that will check the PidMode of all ECS tasks. Here is a basic example:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a low-level service client
   client = boto3.client('ecs')

   # Call ECS to list current tasks
   response = client.list_tasks()

   # Get the details of each task
   for task in response['taskArns']:
       task_definition = client.describe_task_definition(taskDefinition=task)
       # Check if PidMode is set to 'host'
       if 'pidMode' in task_definition['taskDefinition'] and task_definition['taskDefinition']['pidMode'] == 'host':
           print(f"Task {task} has PidMode set as Host.")
   ```
   
4. **Run the Python Script:**
   Finally, you can run the Python script using a Python interpreter. The script will print out all the ECS tasks that have PidMode set as Host.
   ```python
   python check_pid_mode.py
   ```
   
Please note that this script only checks the PidMode of the tasks, it does not change or fix any misconfigurations.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks having PidMode as host in AWS Kubernetes using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. **Access the AWS Management Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/).

2. **Navigate to Amazon ECS**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top left corner of the console, then select "ECS" under the "Compute" section.

3. **Select the Cluster**: From the ECS dashboard, select the cluster where the ECS tasks with PidMode as host are running.

4. **Select the Task Definition**: In the cluster, click on the task definition that includes the ECS tasks with PidMode as host.

5. **Edit Task Definition**: In the task definition details page, click on the "Create new revision" button to create a new revision of the task definition.

6. **Update Container Configuration**:
   - In the container definitions section, find the container that has PidMode set to "host".
   - Click on the container to edit its configuration.
   - Locate the "PidMode" parameter and change its value from "host" to "task".

7. **Save Changes**: After updating the container configuration, click on the "Update" button to save the changes to the task definition.

8. **Update Service**: If the ECS tasks are part of a service, you will need to update the service to use the new task definition revision.
   - Go back to the cluster dashboard and click on the service that is using the task definition with PidMode as host.
   - Click on the "Update" button to update the service to use the new task definition revision.

9. **Verify Changes**: Once the service is updated, verify that the ECS tasks are now using the corrected task definition with PidMode set to "task" instead of "host".

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of ECS tasks having PidMode as host in AWS Kubernetes using the AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration where ECS tasks have PidMode set to "host" in AWS Kubernetes using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. List all the ECS tasks in your cluster to identify the tasks with PidMode set to "host":
   ```
   aws ecs list-tasks --cluster <cluster-name> --query taskArns
   ```

2. Describe each ECS task to check the PidMode configuration:
   ```
   aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster <cluster-name> --tasks <task-arn>
   ```

3. Identify the tasks where PidMode is set to "host".

4. Update the ECS task definition to remove or change the PidMode configuration. You can do this by creating a new task definition revision with the corrected configuration. You can either update the existing task definition or create a new one based on your requirements.

5. To update the task definition, you can use the `register-task-definition` command with the corrected PidMode configuration. For example, if you want to set PidMode to "task" instead of "host":
   ```
   aws ecs register-task-definition --family <task-family> --container-definitions '[{"name":"<container-name>","image":"<image-url>","cpu":<cpu-value>,"memory":<memory-value>,"pidMode":"task"}]'
   ```

6. Once the new task definition is registered, update the ECS service to use the new task definition:
   ```
   aws ecs update-service --cluster <cluster-name> --service <service-name> --task-definition <new-task-definition-arn>
   ```

7. Verify that the ECS tasks are now running with the corrected PidMode configuration:
   ```
   aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster <cluster-name> --tasks <task-arn>
   ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration where ECS tasks have PidMode set to "host" in AWS Kubernetes using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration where ECS tasks have `PidMode` as `host` in AWS Kubernetes using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to describe the ECS task definition and check if the `PidMode` is set to `host`. Here's an example code snippet to achieve this:

```python
import boto3

ecs_client = boto3.client('ecs')

def describe_task_definition(task_definition_arn):
    response = ecs_client.describe_task_definition(taskDefinition=task_definition_arn)
    return response['taskDefinition']

task_definition_arn = 'arn:aws:ecs:your-region:your-account-id:task-definition/your-task-definition'
task_definition = describe_task_definition(task_definition_arn)

if task_definition['pidMode'] == 'host':
    print('ECS task has PidMode set to host')
else:
    print('ECS task does not have PidMode set to host')
```

2. If the `PidMode` is set to `host`, update the ECS task definition to remove the `PidMode` setting. Here's an example code snippet to update the task definition:

```python
def update_task_definition(task_definition_arn):
    response = ecs_client.describe_task_definition(taskDefinition=task_definition_arn)
    task_definition = response['taskDefinition']
    
    # Remove the PidMode setting
    del task_definition['pidMode']
    
    # Update the task definition
    response = ecs_client.register_task_definition(
        family=task_definition['family'],
        containerDefinitions=task_definition['containerDefinitions'],
        volumes=task_definition['volumes']
    )
    return response['taskDefinition']

updated_task_definition = update_task_definition(task_definition_arn)
print('ECS task definition updated successfully')
```

3. Run the Python script to check and remediate the misconfiguration in the ECS task definition in AWS Kubernetes.

Please make sure to replace `your-region`, `your-account-id`, `your-task-definition` with the appropriate values for your AWS account and ECS task definition. Additionally, ensure that your AWS credentials are properly configured for the Boto3 SDK to interact with AWS services.
