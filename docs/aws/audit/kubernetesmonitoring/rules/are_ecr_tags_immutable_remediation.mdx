1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Elastic Container Registry (ECR) service.
3. Select the repository you want to check.
4. In the repository details page, click on the "Edit" button next to "Repository settings".
5. Check the "Image tag mutability" setting. If it is set to "Mutable", then the ECR Repository Tag is not Immutable.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the ECR repositories.

2. Once the AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can list all the ECR repositories in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ecr describe-repositories
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object with details about all your ECR repositories.

3. To check if a specific ECR repository is immutable or not, you can describe the repository policy by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ecr get-lifecycle-policy --repository-name <repository_name>
   ```

   Replace `<repository_name>` with the name of your ECR repository. This command will return a JSON object with the lifecycle policy of the repository.

4. In the returned JSON object, look for the `lifecyclePolicyText` field. This field contains the lifecycle policy of the repository in JSON format. If the repository is immutable, the policy should contain a rule with the `ruleAction` set to `expire` and the `selection` set to `tagStatus` with a value of `untagged`. If such a rule is not present, the repository is not immutable.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if the ECR Repository Tag is Immutable in Kubernetes using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):** First, you need to install and configure the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). This will allow you to interact with AWS services, including ECR. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script:** Next, create a Python script that uses Boto3 to interact with ECR. The script should retrieve all ECR repositories and check the 'imageTagMutability' attribute of each repository. If the attribute is set to 'MUTABLE', it means the ECR Repository Tag is not Immutable.

   Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_ecr_repository_tag_immutable():
       client = boto3.client('ecr')
       response = client.describe_repositories()
       for repository in response['repositories']:
           if repository['imageTagMutability'] == 'MUTABLE':
               print(f"Repository {repository['repositoryName']} has mutable tags")

   check_ecr_repository_tag_immutable()
   ```

3. **Run the Python Script:** Run the Python script using a Python interpreter. The script will print out the names of all ECR repositories that have mutable tags.

4. **Interpret the Results:** If the script prints out any repository names, it means those repositories have mutable tags, which is a misconfiguration. If the script doesn't print out any names, it means all ECR repositories have immutable tags, which is the correct configuration.

Remember to replace the AWS region, access key, and secret access key with your own details. Also, ensure that the IAM user associated with the access key has the necessary permissions to access ECR.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "ECR Repository Tag Should Be Immutable" for AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose the repository that you want to remediate.
3. Choose the "Image tags" tab.
4. Choose the tag that you want to make immutable.
5. Choose "Actions", and then choose "Edit tag immutability".
6. Choose "Immutable", and then choose "Save".

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "ECR Repository Tag Should Be Immutable" for AWS using the AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "ECR Repository Tag Should Be Immutable" in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to create a new ECR repository policy with the rule "ecr:PutImageTagMutability" set to "IMMUTABLE". You can use the following AWS CLI command to create a new ECR repository policy:

```
aws ecr set-repository-policy --repository-name <REPOSITORY_NAME> --policy-text '{"rules": [{"rulePriority": 1,"description": "ECR Repository Tag Should Be Immutable","selection": {"tagStatus": "tagged","tagPrefixList": ["latest"]},"action": {"type": "tagMutability","mutability": "IMMUTABLE"}}]}'
```

Note: Replace `<REPOSITORY_NAME>` with the name of the ECR repository you want to update.

2. Once the new ECR repository policy is created, you need to update the existing ECR repository with the new policy. You can use the following AWS CLI command to update the ECR repository:

```
aws ecr put-image-tag-mutability --repository-name <REPOSITORY_NAME> --image-tag-mutability IMMUTABLE
```

Note: Replace `<REPOSITORY_NAME>` with the name of the ECR repository you want to update.

3. After running the above commands, the ECR repository's tags will be immutable, and no new tags can be created or updated. Any attempt to create or update a tag will result in an error.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "ECR Repository Tag Should Be Immutable" in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of ECR Repository Tag Should Be Immutable in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Create a boto3 ECR client object:

```python
import boto3

ecr_client = boto3.client('ecr')
```

3. Get the list of images in the ECR repository:

```python
repository_name = 'my-ecr-repo'
image_list = ecr_client.list_images(repositoryName=repository_name)['imageIds']
```

4. Iterate through the image list and set the image tag as immutable:

```python
for image in image_list:
    image_digest = image['imageDigest']
    response = ecr_client.put_image_tag_mutability(
        repositoryName=repository_name,
        imageTag=image['imageTag'],
        imageDigest=image_digest,
        imageTagMutability='IMMUTABLE'
    )
```

5. Verify that the tag mutability is set to immutable:

```python
image_detail = ecr_client.describe_images(repositoryName=repository_name, imageIds=[{'imageDigest': image_digest}])['imageDetails'][0]
print(image_detail['imageTags'][0])
print(image_detail['imageTagMutability'])
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of ECR Repository Tag Should Be Immutable in AWS using Python.
