sidebar_label: ECS Tasks With Network Mode Host Should Have Limited Permissions
---

### More Info:

This rule verifies that ECS Task Definitions do not specify a user when using the 'host' network mode. In 'host' network mode, containers share the network namespace with the host, potentially exposing sensitive network configurations or services. Not specifying a user for containers in 'host' mode enhances security by preventing potential privilege escalation or unauthorized access to host resources.

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the ECS (Elastic Container Service) section.

2. In the ECS section, select the cluster where your tasks are running. This will bring up a list of all the tasks running in that cluster.

3. Click on the task you want to inspect. This will bring up the task details page. Here, you can see the network mode of the task under the "Network Mode" section. If the network mode is set to "host", this could be a potential misconfiguration.

4. Next, check the permissions of the task. This can be done by looking at the IAM role associated with the task. You can find this information under the "Task Execution IAM Role" section. If the IAM role has more permissions than necessary, this could be a potential misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. **Identify the ECS tasks with network mode host**: The first step is to identify the ECS tasks that are running with network mode set to host. You can do this by using the AWS CLI command `describe-task-definition`. Here is an example:

   ```
   aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition <task-definition-name>
   ```
   Replace `<task-definition-name>` with the name of your task definition. This command will return a JSON output with the details of the task definition.

2. **Parse the JSON output**: The next step is to parse the JSON output to find the network mode of the task. You can do this by using a tool like `jq`. Here is an example:

   ```
   aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition <task-definition-name> | jq -r '.taskDefinition.networkMode'
   ```
   This command will return the network mode of the task. If it returns `host`, then the task is running with network mode set to host.

3. **Check the permissions of the task**: Now that you have identified the tasks running with network mode host, the next step is to check their permissions. You can do this by using the AWS CLI command `describe-task-definition` again, but this time you need to parse the JSON output to find the task role. Here is an example:

   ```
   aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition <task-definition-name> | jq -r '.taskDefinition.taskRoleArn'
   ```
   This command will return the ARN of the task role.

4. **Inspect the task role**: The final step is to inspect the task role to see what permissions it has. You can do this by using the AWS CLI command `get-role-policy`. Here is an example:

   ```
   aws iam get-role-policy --role-name <role-name> --policy-name <policy-name>
   ```
   Replace `<role-name>` with the name of your role and `<policy-name>` with the name of your policy. This command will return a JSON output with the details of the policy. You can then inspect this output to see what permissions the task has.

#### Using Python

1. Import the necessary libraries: You will need the boto3 library for interacting with AWS services, and the kubernetes library for interacting with Kubernetes.

```python
import boto3
import kubernetes
```

2. Connect to the ECS service: Use the boto3 library to connect to the ECS service and retrieve a list of all running tasks.

```python
ecs = boto3.client('ecs')
response = ecs.list_tasks()
```

3. Check the network mode of each task: For each task in the list, retrieve its task definition and check the network mode. If the network mode is 'host', then the task is running with host networking.

```python
for task_arn in response['taskArns']:
    task_definition = ecs.describe_task_definition(taskDefinition=task_arn)
    if task_definition['taskDefinition']['networkMode'] == 'host':
        print(f"Task {task_arn} is running with host networking.")
```

4. Check the permissions of each task: For each task running with host networking, retrieve its IAM role and check the permissions. If the permissions are not limited, then the task is misconfigured.

```python
for task_arn in response['taskArns']:
    task_definition = ecs.describe_task_definition(taskDefinition=task_arn)
    if task_definition['taskDefinition']['networkMode'] == 'host':
        role_arn = task_definition['taskDefinition']['taskRoleArn']
        iam = boto3.client('iam')
        role_policy = iam.get_role_policy(RoleName=role_arn)
        if 'LimitedPermissions' not in role_policy['PolicyDocument']['Statement'][0]['Action']:
            print(f"Task {task_arn} does not have limited permissions.")
```

This script will print out the ARNs of any tasks that are running with host networking and do not have limited permissions.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks with network mode host having limited permissions in AWS, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Access the AWS Management Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console at https://aws.amazon.com/ and log in with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to ECS**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the console, then select "ECS" under the "Compute" section.

3. **Select Task Definitions**: In the Amazon ECS dashboard, click on "Task Definitions" from the left-hand navigation pane.

4. **Identify Task Definitions**: Review the list of task definitions and identify those using the network mode "host".

5. **Edit Task Definitions**: Click on the task definition that uses network mode "host" to edit it.

6. **Review Container Definitions**: Within the task definition details, navigate to the container definitions section.

7. **Check Container Permissions**: Review the container permissions, specifically the "privileged" and "user" settings.

8. **Update Container Permissions**: If the container is privileged or uses the root user, modify the container definition to remove privileges and use a non-root user.

9. **Save Changes**: After updating the container permissions, save the changes to the task definition.

10. **Re-deploy Tasks**: Re-deploy the ECS tasks associated with the updated task definition to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks with network mode host having limited permissions in AWS using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks with network mode host having limited permissions in AWS Kubernetes using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ECS tasks with network mode host**: Run the following AWS CLI command to list all ECS tasks with network mode host:
   ```
   aws ecs list-tasks --query 'taskArns[*]' --output text
   ```

2. **Update the task definition**: For each ECS task identified in the previous step, you need to update the task definition to limit the permissions. Run the following AWS CLI command to describe the task definition:
   ```
   aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition <task-definition-arn>
   ```

3. **Modify the task definition**: Edit the task definition JSON to remove any unnecessary or overly permissive permissions. Ensure that the task has the least privilege necessary to function properly. Here's an example of modifying the task definition JSON:
   ```json
   {
       "executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole",
       "containerDefinitions": [
           {
               "name": "myContainer",
               "image": "myImage",
               "networkMode": "host",
               "essential": true,
               "portMappings": [
                   {
                       "containerPort": 80,
                       "hostPort": 80
                   }
               ],
               "logConfiguration": {
                   "logDriver": "awslogs",
                   "options": {
                       "awslogs-group": "/ecs/myApp",
                       "awslogs-region": "us-east-1",
                       "awslogs-stream-prefix": "myApp"
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

4. **Update the task definition**: Run the following AWS CLI command to update the task definition with the modified JSON:
   ```
   aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://updated-task-definition.json
   ```

5. **Verify the changes**: Run the following AWS CLI command to verify that the task definition has been updated successfully:
   ```
   aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition <updated-task-definition-arn>
   ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks with network mode host having limited permissions in AWS Kubernetes using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks with network mode host having limited permissions in AWS Kubernetes using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ECS tasks with network mode host**:
   - Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all ECS tasks in your cluster.
   - Filter out the tasks that have the network mode set to host.

2. **Review and update the IAM roles and policies**:
   - Identify the IAM role associated with the ECS tasks that have network mode host.
   - Review the IAM policies attached to this role and ensure that it has only the necessary permissions required for the tasks to function.
   - Remove any excessive permissions that are not needed for the tasks.

3. **Update the IAM role**:
   - Use Boto3 to update the IAM role attached to the ECS tasks.
   - Modify the IAM policies attached to the role to restrict the permissions to the minimum required for the tasks to operate effectively.

4. **Implement least privilege principle**:
   - Follow the principle of least privilege while updating the IAM policies.
   - Grant only the permissions necessary for the tasks to function properly and restrict access to other AWS resources.

5. **Test the updated configuration**:
   - Deploy the updated IAM role configuration to the ECS tasks with network mode host.
   - Test the tasks to ensure they can still perform their required functions without any issues.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks with network mode host having limited permissions in AWS Kubernetes using Python.
