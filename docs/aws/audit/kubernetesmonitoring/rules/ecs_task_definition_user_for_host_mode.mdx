sidebar_label: ECS Tasks With Network Mode Host Should Have Limited Permissions
---

### More Info:

This rule verifies that ECS Task Definitions do not specify a user when using the 'host' network mode. In 'host' network mode, containers share the network namespace with the host, potentially exposing sensitive network configurations or services. Not specifying a user for containers in 'host' mode enhances security by preventing potential privilege escalation or unauthorized access to host resources.

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the ECS (Elastic Container Service) section.

2. In the ECS section, select the cluster where your tasks are running. 

3. Once you've selected the cluster, navigate to the "Tasks" tab. Here, you will see a list of all the tasks running in your cluster.

4. For each task, click on the task to view its details. In the task details, look for the "Network Mode" field. If the Network Mode is set to "host", this means the task is using the host's network stack and not its own. 

5. After confirming the network mode, check the IAM role associated with the task. You can find this under the "Task Execution IAM Role" field. 

6. Navigate to the IAM section of the AWS console and find the role you just identified. Check the permissions attached to this role. If the permissions are too broad or include permissions that the task does not need to function, this is a misconfiguration. 

Remember, tasks running in host network mode have the same networking permissions as the host itself, so it's important to limit the permissions of these tasks to only what they need to function.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the ECS tasks using the following command:

   ```
   aws ecs list-tasks --cluster <cluster-name>
   ```

   Replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of your ECS cluster. This command will return a list of task ARNs.

3. For each task ARN, describe the task to get its network mode. Use the following command:

   ```
   aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster <cluster-name> --tasks <task-arn>
   ```

   Replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of your ECS cluster and `<task-arn>` with the ARN of the task. This command will return a JSON object that includes the task's network mode.

4. Check the "networkMode" field in the returned JSON. If it is set to "host", then the task is using host network mode. This is a potential misconfiguration as tasks with host network mode have the same network access as the host, which can lead to security issues if the task is compromised.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Import the necessary libraries in Python. You will need boto3 for AWS, azure-mgmt-resource for Azure, and google-cloud-resource-manager for GCP. 

```python
import boto3
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
from google.cloud import resource_manager
```

2. For AWS, create a session using your credentials and initialize the ECS client. Then, list all the task definitions and check their network mode. If it's 'host', check the permissions.

```python
session = boto3.Session(aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
                        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
                        region_name='us-west-2')
ecs_client = session.client('ecs')

def check_task_permissions():
    response = ecs_client.list_task_definitions()
    for task in response['taskDefinitionArns']:
        task_def = ecs_client.describe_task_definition(taskDefinition=task)
        if task_def['taskDefinition']['networkMode'] == 'host':
            # Check permissions here
```

3. For Azure, you need to authenticate and initialize the Kubernetes client. Then, list all the pods and check their network policy. If it's 'hostNetwork', check the permissions.

```python
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    secret='YOUR_SECRET',
    tenant='YOUR_TENANT_ID'
)
kubernetes_client = KubernetesClient(credentials, 'YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID')

def check_pod_permissions():
    for pod in kubernetes_client.list_pods():
        if pod.spec.host_network:
            # Check permissions here
```

4. For GCP, you need to authenticate and initialize the Kubernetes Engine client. Then, list all the pods and check their network policy. If it's 'hostNetwork', check the permissions.

```python
client = resource_manager.Client()
kubernetes_engine_client = client.kubernetes_engine()

def check_pod_permissions():
    for pod in kubernetes_engine_client.list_pods():
        if pod.spec.host_network:
            # Check permissions here
```

Please replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID', 'YOUR_SECRET', 'YOUR_TENANT_ID', and 'YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID' with your actual credentials. Also, the 'Check permissions here' comment is where you would add the code to check the permissions of the task or pod. This would depend on your specific requirements and is not included in this example.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks with network mode host having limited permissions in AWS, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Access the AWS Management Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console at https://aws.amazon.com/ and log in with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to ECS**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the console, then select "ECS" under the "Compute" section.

3. **Select the Cluster**: From the ECS dashboard, select the cluster where the ECS tasks with network mode host are running.

4. **Select the Task Definition**: In the cluster, click on the task definition that includes the ECS tasks with network mode host that need to have limited permissions.

5. **Edit Task Definition**: In the task definition details page, click on the "Create new revision" button to create a new revision of the task definition.

6. **Update Task Definition**: In the task definition editor, scroll down to the "Task execution IAM role" section. Here, you can update the task execution role to have limited permissions by attaching a custom IAM policy with restricted permissions.

7. **Create a Custom IAM Policy**: If you don't have a custom IAM policy with limited permissions already created, you can create one by navigating to the IAM service in the AWS Management Console. Click on "Policies" in the left-hand menu, then click on "Create policy" and follow the steps to define the policy with the necessary limited permissions.

8. **Attach Custom IAM Policy**: Once you have created the custom IAM policy with limited permissions, go back to the task definition editor in the ECS console. In the "Task execution IAM role" section, click on "Attach policies" and search for the custom IAM policy you created. Select the policy and attach it to the task execution role.

9. **Review and Save**: Review the changes you have made to the task definition, ensuring that the task execution role now has limited permissions. Once you are satisfied with the changes, click on the "Create" button to save the new revision of the task definition.

10. **Update ECS Service**: After saving the new revision of the task definition, go back to the ECS cluster dashboard and select the service that is running the ECS tasks with network mode host. Update the service to use the new revision of the task definition with the limited permissions for the task execution role.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks with network mode host having limited permissions in AWS using the AWS Management Console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks with network mode host having limited permissions in AWS Kubernetes using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ECS tasks with network mode host**: Run the following AWS CLI command to list all ECS tasks with network mode host:
   ```
   aws ecs list-tasks --query 'taskArns[*]' --output text
   ```

2. **Update the task definition**: For each ECS task identified in the previous step, you need to update the task definition to limit the permissions. Run the following AWS CLI command to describe the task definition:
   ```
   aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition <task-definition-arn>
   ```

3. **Modify the task definition**: Edit the task definition JSON to remove any unnecessary or overly permissive permissions. Ensure that the task has the least privilege necessary to function properly. Here's an example of modifying the task definition JSON:
   ```json
   {
       "executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole",
       "containerDefinitions": [
           {
               "name": "myContainer",
               "image": "myImage",
               "networkMode": "host",
               "essential": true,
               "portMappings": [
                   {
                       "containerPort": 80,
                       "hostPort": 80
                   }
               ],
               "logConfiguration": {
                   "logDriver": "awslogs",
                   "options": {
                       "awslogs-group": "/ecs/myApp",
                       "awslogs-region": "us-east-1",
                       "awslogs-stream-prefix": "myApp"
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

4. **Update the task definition**: Run the following AWS CLI command to update the task definition with the modified JSON:
   ```
   aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://updated-task-definition.json
   ```

5. **Verify the changes**: Run the following AWS CLI command to verify that the task definition has been updated successfully:
   ```
   aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition <updated-task-definition-arn>
   ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks with network mode host having limited permissions in AWS Kubernetes using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks with network mode host having limited permissions in AWS Kubernetes using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ECS tasks with network mode host**:
   - Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all ECS tasks in your cluster.
   - Filter out the tasks that have the network mode set to host.

2. **Review and update the IAM roles and policies**:
   - Identify the IAM role associated with the ECS tasks that have network mode host.
   - Review the IAM policies attached to this role and ensure that it has only the necessary permissions required for the tasks to function.
   - Remove any excessive permissions that are not needed for the tasks.

3. **Update the IAM role**:
   - Use Boto3 to update the IAM role attached to the ECS tasks.
   - Modify the IAM policies attached to the role to restrict the permissions to the minimum required for the tasks to operate effectively.

4. **Implement least privilege principle**:
   - Follow the principle of least privilege while updating the IAM policies.
   - Grant only the permissions necessary for the tasks to function properly and restrict access to other AWS resources.

5. **Test the updated configuration**:
   - Deploy the updated IAM role configuration to the ECS tasks with network mode host.
   - Test the tasks to ensure they can still perform their required functions without any issues.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of ECS tasks with network mode host having limited permissions in AWS Kubernetes using Python.
