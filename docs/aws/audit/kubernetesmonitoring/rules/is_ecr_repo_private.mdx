How to enable ECR private repositories?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon ECR service.
2. Click on "Repositories" in the navigation panel on the left side.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "ECR Repositories Should Be Private" Policy.)
3. Select the ECR repository for which you want to enable private access.
4. In the repository details page, click on the "Permissions" tab.
5. Under "Repository policies," click on the "Edit" button.
6. In the repository policy editor, provide a JSON policy that restricts access to the repository. You can use the following policy as a starting point:
```json
{
  "Version": "2008-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowPull",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "<AWS account ID or IAM user ARN>"
      },
      "Action": [
        "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
        "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
        "ecr:BatchGetImage"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "DenyOther",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "NotPrincipal": {
        "AWS": "<AWS account ID or IAM user ARN>"
      },
      "Action": [
        "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
        "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
        "ecr:BatchGetImage"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
Replace `<AWS account ID or IAM user ARN>` with the appropriate AWS account ID or IAM user ARN that should have access to the repository. You can specify multiple principals by providing a list of AWS account IDs or IAM user ARNs.
7. Once you have customized the policy, click on the "Save" button to apply the repository policy.
8. A confirmation message will appear, indicating that the repository policy has been saved.
9. Your ECR repository is now configured as a private repository, and access is restricted according to the repository policy.
