<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EKS service.
2. In the left navigation pane, select "Clusters" to view all the existing EKS clusters.
3. Click on the name of the cluster you want to inspect. This will open the cluster's details page.
4. In the cluster's details page, under the "Networking" section, check the "Security groups for your nodes". Click on the security group ID to open the security group settings. In the "Inbound rules" tab, verify if there are any rules that allow inbound traffic other than port 443. If there are, it indicates a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the EKS cluster.

2. Once the AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can use the following command to list all the security groups associated with your EKS cluster:

   ```
   aws eks describe-cluster --name <cluster-name> --query "cluster.resourcesVpcConfig.securityGroupIds"
   ```
   Replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of your EKS cluster. This command will return the IDs of the security groups associated with your EKS cluster.

3. Now, you can use the following command to describe the inbound rules of a security group:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>
   ```
   Replace `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group you want to check. This command will return the inbound rules of the specified security group.

4. Finally, you need to check the output of the previous command. Look for the inbound rules that allow traffic on port 443. If there are any inbound rules that allow traffic on other ports, then the EKS cluster is misconfigured.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries:
   You will need the boto3 library to interact with AWS services. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials:
   You need to configure your AWS credentials to allow your script to interact with your AWS services. You can do this by setting the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables, or by using the AWS CLI's configure command:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check the EKS cluster's security group rules:
   Here is a simple script that lists all the security groups for an EKS cluster and checks if they only allow inbound traffic on port 443:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a session using your AWS credentials
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
   )

   # Create an EKS client
   eks = session.client('eks')

   # Get the details of the EKS cluster
   cluster = eks.describe_cluster(name='your-cluster-name')

   # Get the security group IDs
   security_group_ids = cluster['cluster']['resourcesVpcConfig']['securityGroupIds']

   # Create an EC2 resource
   ec2 = session.resource('ec2')

   # Check the inbound rules of each security group
   for sg_id in security_group_ids:
       security_group = ec2.SecurityGroup(sg_id)
       for permission in security_group.ip_permissions:
           # If there is any rule that allows traffic on a port other than 443, print a warning
           if permission['FromPort'] != 443 or permission['ToPort'] != 443:
               print(f'Security group {sg_id} allows traffic on port {permission["FromPort"]}-{permission["ToPort"]}')
   ```

4. Run the script:
   You can run the script using the Python interpreter:
   ```
   python check_eks_security_group.py
   ```
   The script will print a warning for each security group rule that allows traffic on a port other than 443. If no warnings are printed, then all your security groups only allow inbound traffic on port 443.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration in AWS, follow the steps below:

1. Login to the AWS console and navigate to the Amazon EKS service.

2. Select the EKS cluster that needs to be remediated.

3. Click on the "Configuration" tab in the left-hand menu.

4. Scroll down to the "Networking" section and click on the "Edit" button.

5. In the "Security group rules" section, locate the security group that is associated with your EKS cluster.

6. Click on the "Edit" button next to the security group.

7. In the "Inbound rules" section, locate the rule that allows inbound traffic on port 443.

8. If the rule is missing, click on the "Add rule" button and select "HTTPS" from the dropdown menu.

9. If the rule is present but allows traffic from other ports as well, click on the "Edit" button next to the rule and change the port range to only allow traffic on port 443.

10. Once the rule has been updated, click on the "Save rules" button to apply the changes.

11. Verify that the inbound traffic is now restricted to port 443 by checking the security group rules.

Your EKS cluster should now only allow inbound traffic on port 443, which will remediate the misconfiguration.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this misconfiguration for an EKS cluster in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the EKS clusters in your AWS account:

```
aws eks list-clusters
```

3. Choose the EKS cluster that you want to remediate and run the following command to update the cluster's security group:

```
aws eks update-cluster-config --name <cluster_name> --region <region_name> --resources-vpc-config securityGroupIds=<security_group_id>
```

Replace the `<cluster_name>` with the name of your EKS cluster, `<region_name>` with the AWS region where your cluster is located and `<security_group_id>` with the ID of the security group associated with your EKS cluster.

4. Run the following command to create a new security group rule that allows inbound traffic only from port 443:

```
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <security_group_id> --protocol tcp --port 443 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

Replace the `<security_group_id>` with the ID of the security group associated with your EKS cluster.

5. Verify that the new security group rule has been added successfully by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security_group_id>
```

This should return a JSON object containing the details of the security group associated with your EKS cluster, including the new inbound rule for port 443.

Your EKS cluster is now configured to allow inbound traffic only from port 443.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of allowing inbound traffic only from port 443 for an EKS Cluster in AWS, you can follow the below steps using Python:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using the following command:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Create a Boto3 client for Amazon EKS using the following code:

```python
import boto3

eks_client = boto3.client('eks')
```

3. Get the details of the EKS cluster using the following code:

```python
cluster_name = 'your_cluster_name'
response = eks_client.describe_cluster(name=cluster_name)
```

4. Get the security group ID of the worker nodes using the following code:

```python
security_group_id = response['cluster']['resourcesVpcConfig']['clusterSecurityGroupId']
```

5. Get the details of the security group using the following code:

```python
ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2_client.describe_security_groups(GroupIds=[security_group_id])
```

6. Update the inbound rules of the security group to allow traffic only from port 443 using the following code:

```python
ip_permissions = response['SecurityGroups'][0]['IpPermissions']
for permission in ip_permissions:
    if permission['IpProtocol'] == 'tcp' and permission['FromPort'] != 443:
        ec2_client.revoke_security_group_ingress(
            GroupId=security_group_id,
            IpPermissions=[
                {
                    'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
                    'FromPort': permission['FromPort'],
                    'ToPort': permission['ToPort'],
                    'IpRanges': permission['IpRanges'],
                    'Ipv6Ranges': permission['Ipv6Ranges'],
                    'PrefixListIds': permission['PrefixListIds'],
                    'UserIdGroupPairs': permission['UserIdGroupPairs']
                }
            ]
        )

ec2_client.authorize_security_group_ingress(
    GroupId=security_group_id,
    IpPermissions=[
        {
            'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
            'FromPort': 443,
            'ToPort': 443,
            'IpRanges': [
                {
                    'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
```

This code will remove all the existing inbound rules that allow traffic from ports other than 443 and add a new inbound rule that allows traffic only from port 443. 

Note: Replace 'your_cluster_name' with the actual name of your EKS cluster. Also, make sure you have the necessary permissions to modify the security group.
