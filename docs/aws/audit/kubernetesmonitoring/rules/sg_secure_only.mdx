### Remediation

How to reconfigure the security groups associated with Amazon EKS clusters in order to allow access only on HTTPS?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the Amazon EC2 Management Console and navigate to the "Security Groups" section.
2. Search for the security group associated with your EKS cluster.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "EKS Cluster Should Allow Inbound Traffic only from Port 443(HTTPS)" Policy.)
3. Select the security group and click on the "Inbound Rules" tab.
4. Find the existing rule that allows inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and delete it.
5. Add a new inbound rule that allows inbound traffic on port 443 (HTTPS) from the desired source IP range or security group. You can set the source IP range to 0.0.0.0/0 to allow access from any IP address, or specify specific IP ranges as per your requirements.
6. Save the changes to update the security group configuration.
