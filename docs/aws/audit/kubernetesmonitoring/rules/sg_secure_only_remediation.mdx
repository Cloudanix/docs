How to reconfigure the security groups associated with Amazon EKS clusters in order to allow access only on HTTPS?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the navigation panel, under NETWORK & SECURITY section, choose Security Groups.

- Step 2: Select the security group that you want to reconfigure (see Audit section part I to identify the right security group).

- Step 3: Select the Inbound tab from the dashboard bottom panel and click the Edit button to update inbound rules configuration.

- Step 4: Inside the Edit inbound rules dialog box, find the inbound rule(s) configured to allow access on ports different than TCP port 443, then click on the x button next to each rule to remove it from the security group. Once all non-compliant inbound rules are deleted from the selected security group, click Save to apply the changes.
