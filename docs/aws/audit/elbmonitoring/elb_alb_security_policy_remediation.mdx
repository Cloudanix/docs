How to check if ALBs have latest SSL/TLS configuration?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the left navigation panel, under LOAD BALANCING section, choose Load Balancers.

- Step 2: Select the AWS ELB that you want to replace with the ALB, used by your HTTP/HTTPS application (see Audit section part I to identify the right ELB resource). Once the load balancer is selected, gather the necessary configuration information by performing the following actions:
  A: Select the Description tab from the dashboard bottom panel and note the resource configuration details and attributes. This information will be useful later when the AWS ALB will be created.

  B: Select the Instances tab and note the IDs of the EC2 instances currently attached to the load balancer.

  C: Select the Health Check tab and note the ELB health check configuration details.

  D: Select the Listeners tab and note the listener(s) current configuration details.

  E: Lastly, select the Tags tab and note all the tags defined for the load balancer.

- Step 3: Now itâ€™s time to create the new Application Load Balancer that will replace the existing Classic Load Balancer. To start the ALB setup process, click the Create Load Balancer button from the dashboard top menu.

- Step 4: On the Select load balancer type page, choose Application Load Balancer then click Continue.

- Step 5: On the Step 1: Configure Load Balancer page, provide a unique name for your new AWS ALB then configure the load balancer scheme, listeners and availability zones based on the information gathered at step no. 4. Once all these are configured, use the Add tab button, available in the Tags section, to add the necessary tags from the existing (classic) load balancer. Click Next: Configure Security Settings to continue the setup process.

- Step 6: On the Step 2: Configure Security Settings page, configure the secure (HTTPS) listener using the information gathered at step no. 4 (i.e. the SSL certificate name and the security policy name). If your classic load balancer is not using an HTTPS listener just skip this page. Click Next: Configure Security Groups to continue.

- Step 7: On the Step 3: Configure Security Groups page, choose Select an existing security group option then select the required security group(s) used by the existing ELB. Click Next: Configure Routing.

- Step 8: On the Step 4: Configure Routing page, choose an existing Target Group (if there are any target groups already created in your AWS account) or set a new one based on your requirements. In the Health checks section, click Advanced health check settings and configure the new load balancer health checks using the information gathered at step no. 4. Click Next: Register Targets to continue the ALB setup process.

- Step 9: On the Step 5: Register Targets page, use the Add to registered button to attach the necessary backend instances to the new ALB. Use the information taken at step no. 4 to register the right instances with the load balancer. The ALB will start routing requests to the registered EC2 instances as soon as the setup process completes and the instances pass the initial health checks. Click the Next: Review button.

- Step 10: On the Step 6: Review page, examine all the necessary configuration details then click Create to build your new Application Load Balancer.

- Step 11: On the Load Balancer Creation status page, wait for the confirmation message then click Close to return to the EC2 dashboard.

- Step 12: Now test the new AWS Application Load Balancer by using its DNS name (e.g. MyWebAppALB-1554377808.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com) and make sure that the HTTP/HTTPS traffic is distributed properly between the registered instances.

- Step 13: As soon as the testing phase is complete, update the DNS record that associates your domain name with the load balancer by replacing the ELB DNS name with the ALB DNS name in order to redirect the incoming traffic to your new AWS Application Load Balancer.

- Step 14: Once the traffic is redirected entirely to the new ALB, go back to the EC2 dashboard and remove the Classic Load Balancer. To delete the ELB, perform the following:

  A: Select the Classic Load Balancer that you want to delete.

  B: Click the Actions dropdown button from the dashboard top menu and select Delete.

  C: On the Delete Load Balancer confirmation page, review the resource details then click Yes, Delete to remove the selected ELB from your AWS account.
