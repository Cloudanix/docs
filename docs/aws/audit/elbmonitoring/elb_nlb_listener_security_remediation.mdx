How to configure NLBs to terminate TLS traffic?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the left navigation panel, under LOAD BALANCING section, choose Load Balancers.

- Step 2: Set the Type attribute to network inside the filter box to return the Network Load Balancers only.

- Step 3: Select the Network Load Balancer that you want to reconfigure (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource).

- Step 4: Choose the Listeners tab from the bottom panel and click Add listener to add a new entry.

- Step 5: On the Add Listener panel, perform the following:
  A: From the Protocol dropdown list, select TLS. You can use the default port (i.e. 443) or you can enter a custom port number from which to listen to for traffic.

  B: For Default action(s), click + Add action, choose Forward to option and select the target group associated with the selected load balancer.

  C: From Security policy dropdown list, select one of the following policies, depending on your application/service requirements or the required compliance and security standards: ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01, ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-1-2017-01, ELBSecurityPolicy-FS-2018-06 or ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-Ext-2018-06.

  D: From Default SSL certificate dropdown list, choose one of the following options:
  a. From ACM (recommended) - to use an existing SSL certificate purchased via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). If you havenâ€™t purchased yet any SSL certificates you can click Request new ACM certificate link and AWS will redirect your request to the ACM service dashboard where you can buy the required certificate.

        b. From IAM - to use an existing SSL certificate uploaded previously to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) using the ELBv2 dashboard. Select the existing certificate name from the Select one dropdown list.

  c. Import - deploy an existing SSL certificate by providing the required information (in PEM-encoded format) to the Certificate private key, Certificate body and Certificate chain boxes, information granted by the SSL provider from which you bought the certificate. Once the necessary keys are validated, enter a name for the new certificate in the Certificate name box if you select IAM to manage your newly imported SSL certificate.

  E: Click Save to apply the changes and add the secure listener to the selected load balancer.

  F: Click < (back button) to return to the Load Balancers dashboard.
