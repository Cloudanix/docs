How to update an insecure or invalid security group assigned to load balancer?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.
2. From the EC2 dashboard, click on "Load Balancers" in the left navigation menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "ELB Security Layer Should Have Atleast One Valid Security Group" Policy.)
3. Select the load balancer for which you want to update the security group.
4. In the load balancer details page, go to the "Description" tab.
5. Under the "Security" section, you will see the "Security groups" field. Note down the security group(s) associated with the load balancer.
6. Go to the EC2 dashboard and click on "Security Groups" in the left navigation menu.
7. Locate the security group that you want to update.
8. In the security group details page, click on the "Inbound Rules" or "Outbound Rules" tab, depending on whether you need to update the inbound or outbound rules.
9. Review the existing rules and make the necessary changes to ensure the security group allows only the desired traffic and blocks any insecure or invalid configurations.
10. If required, you can add new rules, modify existing rules, or remove unnecessary rules to secure the traffic.
11. Click on the "Save rules" or "Apply changes" button to save the updated security group configuration.
12. Return to the load balancer details page.
13. Click on the "Edit" button in the "Security groups" section.
