<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To ensure that the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations is used for App-Tier Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS CLI:

1. **Identify the Load Balancer:**
   First, identify the name of the load balancer for which you want to update the SSL policy.
   ```sh
   aws elb describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancerDescriptions[*].LoadBalancerName'
   ```

2. **Describe the Current SSL Policies:**
   Check the current SSL policies associated with your load balancer to understand what is currently in use.
   ```sh
   aws elb describe-load-balancer-policies --load-balancer-name <your-load-balancer-name>
   ```

3. **Set the Latest SSL Policy:**
   Update the load balancer to use the latest AWS predefined security policy. As of the latest update, `ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08` is a commonly recommended policy, but you should verify the latest policy name in the AWS documentation.
   ```sh
   aws elb set-load-balancer-policies-of-listener --load-balancer-name <your-load-balancer-name> --load-balancer-port 443 --policy-names ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08
   ```

4. **Verify the Update:**
   Confirm that the load balancer is now using the updated SSL policy.
   ```sh
   aws elb describe-load-balancer-policies --load-balancer-name <your-load-balancer-name>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your App-Tier ELBs are using the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of not using the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations in App-Tier Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs), you can use the AWS SDK for Python, also known as Boto3. Below are the steps to ensure that the latest security policy is applied to your ELBs:

### Step 1: Install Boto3
First, ensure that Boto3 is installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

### Step 2: Initialize Boto3 Client
Initialize the Boto3 client for Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):
```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('elbv2')  # For Application Load Balancers (ALB)
```

### Step 3: Retrieve List of Load Balancers
Retrieve the list of load balancers to identify the ones that need updating:
```python
response = client.describe_load_balancers()
load_balancers = response['LoadBalancers']
```

### Step 4: Update SSL Policy
Loop through the load balancers and update their SSL policies to the latest recommended policy:
```python
latest_ssl_policy = 'ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08'  # Example of a latest policy, update as per AWS recommendations

for lb in load_balancers:
    lb_arn = lb['LoadBalancerArn']
    
    # Describe listeners to get the listener ARNs
    listeners = client.describe_listeners(LoadBalancerArn=lb_arn)['Listeners']
    
    for listener in listeners:
        if listener['Protocol'] == 'HTTPS':
            listener_arn = listener['ListenerArn']
            
            # Modify the listener to use the latest SSL policy
            client.modify_listener(
                ListenerArn=listener_arn,
                SslPolicy=latest_ssl_policy
            )
            print(f"Updated SSL policy for listener {listener_arn} to {latest_ssl_policy}")
```

### Summary
1. **Install Boto3**: Ensure Boto3 is installed in your Python environment.
2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**: Set up the Boto3 client for ELB.
3. **Retrieve List of Load Balancers**: Get the list of load balancers.
4. **Update SSL Policy**: Loop through the load balancers and update their SSL policies to the latest recommended policy.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "Load Balancing", click on "Load Balancers".
3. Select the load balancer you want to inspect. In the "Description" tab below, find the "Listeners" section.
4. Check the "SSL Certificate" column. If the SSL certificate is not listed for the HTTPS or SSL protocols, it means that the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations is not being used.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the load balancers in your account using the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object with details about all your load balancers.

3. To check the SSL policies of each load balancer, you need to describe the listeners for each load balancer. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-listeners --load-balancer-arn <load-balancer-arn>
   ```

   Replace `<load-balancer-arn>` with the ARN of your load balancer. This command will return a JSON object with details about the listeners for your load balancer.

4. To specifically check the SSL policy, you need to look at the 'SslPolicy' field in the JSON object returned by the previous command. If the 'SslPolicy' field is not set to the latest security policy, then the load balancer is not using the latest SSL negotiations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3` in your terminal.

2. Import the necessary modules and establish a session with AWS using your credentials. Here's a basic setup:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Now, create a client for ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) and retrieve all the load balancers. Then, for each load balancer, retrieve its policies and check if the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations is used.

```python
elb = session.client('elbv2')

load_balancers = elb.describe_load_balancers()
for lb in load_balancers['LoadBalancers']:
    lb_arn = lb['LoadBalancerArn']
    policies = elb.describe_ssl_policies(LoadBalancerArn=lb_arn)
    for policy in policies['Policies']:
        if 'ELBSecurityPolicy' not in policy['PolicyName']:
            print(f"Load balancer {lb['LoadBalancerName']} is not using the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations.")
```

4. The above script will print out the names of all load balancers that are not using the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations. If no such load balancers are found, the script will not output anything. This way, you can easily detect any misconfigurations in your AWS Elastic Load Balancers.

Remember to replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'`, `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'`, and `'YOUR_REGION'` with your actual AWS access key, secret key, and region, respectively.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of using the latest AWS Security Policy for SSL negotiations for App-Tier ELBs in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to get the current SSL policy for your App-Tier ELB:

   ```
   aws elb describe-load-balancers --load-balancer-name <your-ELB-name> --query "LoadBalancerDescriptions[].ListenerDescriptions[].PolicyNames[]"
   ```

   Replace `<your-ELB-name>` with the name of your App-Tier ELB.

3. If the output includes any SSL policies other than the latest AWS Security Policy, you need to update the SSL policy. Run the following command to update the SSL policy for your App-Tier ELB:

   ```
   aws elb set-load-balancer-policies-of-listener --load-balancer-name <your-ELB-name> --load-balancer-port 443 --policy-names ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08
   ```

   Replace `<your-ELB-name>` with the name of your App-Tier ELB.

4. Verify that the SSL policy has been updated by running the command in step 2 again.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all App-Tier ELBs in your AWS environment.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of using the latest AWS Security Policy for SSL negotiations for App-Tier ELBs in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Latest AWS Security Policy for SSL Negotiations Should Be Used For App-Tier ELBs" in AWS using Python, follow the steps below:

1. Import the necessary AWS libraries and modules:

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Create an ELB client object:

```python
elb_client = boto3.client('elbv2')
```

3. Get a list of all the existing load balancers:

```python
response = elb_client.describe_load_balancers()
load_balancers = response['LoadBalancers']
```

4. Loop through the list of load balancers and check if they are application tier ELBs:

```python
for lb in load_balancers:
    if lb['Type'] == 'application':
        # Do something
```

5. Once you have identified the application tier ELBs, update their SSL policy to use the latest AWS security policy:

```python
try:
    response = elb_client.set_security_groups(
        LoadBalancerArn=lb['LoadBalancerArn'],
        SecurityGroups=[
            'security_group_id'
        ]
    )
except ClientError as e:
    print(e)
```

6. Replace `'security_group_id'` with the ID of the security group that you want to associate with the ELB.
