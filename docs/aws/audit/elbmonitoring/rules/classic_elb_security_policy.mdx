### Triage and Remediation

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard. Under the "Load Balancing" section in the left navigation pane, click on "Load Balancers".
3. Select the Load Balancer you want to inspect. In the bottom pane, click on the "Listeners" tab.
4. In the "Listeners" tab, under the "SSL Certificate" column, click on the "Change" link. This will open a pop-up window where you can see the SSL Policy in use. If the policy is not the latest, then it is a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the load balancers in your account using the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with details about all the load balancers in your account.

3. To check the security policy used by each load balancer, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-ssl-policies --names [policy-name]
   ```

   Replace [policy-name] with the name of the security policy used by the load balancer. You can find this information in the output of the previous command.

4. The output of this command will include a list of SSL protocols and ciphers used by the security policy. You can compare this list with the latest AWS recommended security policy to detect any misconfigurations. AWS regularly updates their recommended security policy, so make sure to check their documentation for the latest version.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) which allows Python developer to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. These can be configured in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   You'll be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

3. Write a Python script to check ELBs security policies: The following Python script uses Boto3 to list all the load balancers in your AWS account and check if they are using the latest predefined security policy.

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_elb_security_policy():
       elbv2 = boto3.client('elbv2')
       elbs = elbv2.describe_load_balancers()
       for elb in elbs['LoadBalancers']:
           response = elbv2.describe_ssl_policies(
               Names=[
                   elb['SslPolicy'],
               ]
           )
           for policy in response['SslPolicies']:
               if not policy['IsDefaultPolicy']:
                   print(f"ELB {elb['LoadBalancerName']} is not using the latest AWS security policy")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_elb_security_policy()
   ```

4. Run the Python script: You can run the Python script from your terminal using the following command:

   ```bash
   python check_elb_security_policy.py
   ```

   The script will print the names of all ELBs that are not using the latest AWS security policy. If no output is produced, it means all your ELBs are using the latest AWS security policy.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "ELBs Must Use Latest AWS Security Policies" for AWS, you can follow the below steps using the AWS Console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 service and select "Load Balancers" from the left-hand menu.
3. Select the ELB that needs to be remediated.
4. Click on the "Listeners" tab.
5. Check if the "HTTPS" protocol is being used. If it is, then click on the "Edit" button next to the listener.
6. Under "Security Policy", select the latest security policy from the drop-down list.
7. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you will remediate the misconfiguration "ELBs Must Use Latest AWS Security Policies" for AWS using the AWS console.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "ELBs Must Use Latest AWS Security Policies" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Check the current security policy of the ELB using the following command:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancers --load-balancer-names <ELB_Name> --query "LoadBalancerDescriptions[].PolicyNames[]"
```

2. Check the latest security policy available using the following command:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancer-policies --policy-names AWSConsole-SSLNegotiationPolicy-2016-08
```

3. Create a new policy using the latest security policy available using the following command:

```
aws elb create-load-balancer-policy --load-balancer-name <ELB_Name> --policy-name AWSConsole-SSLNegotiationPolicy-2016-08 --policy-type-name SSLNegotiationPolicyType --policy-attributes AttributeName=Reference-Security-Policy,AttributeValue=ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01
```

4. Apply the newly created policy to the ELB using the following command:

```
aws elb set-load-balancer-policies-for-backend-server --load-balancer-name <ELB_Name> --instance-port 443 --policy-names AWSConsole-SSLNegotiationPolicy-2016-08
```

5. Verify that the new policy is applied to the ELB using the following command:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancers --load-balancer-names <ELB_Name> --query "LoadBalancerDescriptions[].PolicyNames[]"
```

After following these steps, the ELB will be using the latest AWS security policies.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the ELBs Must Use Latest AWS Security Policies misconfiguration for AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed and configured on your local machine.

2. Next, you need to identify the ELBs that are not using the latest AWS security policies. You can do this by using the `describe_load_balancers` method of the `boto3.client('elbv2')` object. This method returns a list of all the load balancers in your account.

3. For each load balancer, you need to check if it is using the latest AWS security policy. You can do this by using the `describe_load_balancer_attributes` method of the `boto3.client('elbv2')` object. This method returns a dictionary of the load balancer attributes.

4. Check if the load balancer is using the latest security policy by looking for the `ssl_policy` attribute in the dictionary. If the value of this attribute is not `ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08`, then the load balancer is not using the latest security policy.

5. To update the load balancer to use the latest security policy, you can use the `modify_load_balancer_attributes` method of the `boto3.client('elbv2')` object. You need to set the `ssl_policy` attribute to `ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08`.

Here's the Python code to remediate the ELBs Must Use Latest AWS Security Policies misconfiguration:

```
import boto3

# create an ELB client object
elbv2 = boto3.client('elbv2')

# get a list of all the load balancers in your account
load_balancers = elbv2.describe_load_balancers()

# iterate through each load balancer
for lb in load_balancers['LoadBalancers']:
    # get the load balancer attributes
    lb_attributes = elbv2.describe_load_balancer_attributes(LoadBalancerArn=lb['LoadBalancerArn'])
    
    # check if the load balancer is using the latest security policy
    if lb_attributes['Attributes']['SslPolicy'] != 'ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08':
        # update the load balancer to use the latest security policy
        elbv2.modify_load_balancer_attributes(
            LoadBalancerArn=lb['LoadBalancerArn'],
            Attributes=[
                {
                    'Key': 'ssl_policy',
                    'Value': 'ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08'
                },
            ]
        )
```

Note: This code only updates the ELBs that are not using the latest AWS security policies. If all your ELBs are already using the latest security policy, then this code will not make any changes.
