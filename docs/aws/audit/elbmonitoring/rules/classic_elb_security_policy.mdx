### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.

3. Select the load balancer that you want to check.

4. In the bottom panel, select the "Listeners" tab. Here, you can see the SSL certificate and Policy of the load balancer.

5. Click on the cipher in the SSL Policy column. A pop-up window will appear showing the details of the SSL policy. Check if the policy is the latest one. If it's not, then it's a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. **List all the Load Balancers**: The first step to check the security policies of ELBs is to list all the load balancers in your account. You can do this by running the following command: `aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers`. This command will return a JSON object containing details about all the load balancers in your account.

3. **Describe Load Balancer Attributes**: For each load balancer, you need to describe its attributes to get information about its security policy. You can do this by running the following command: `aws elbv2 describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <LoadBalancerArn>`. Replace `<LoadBalancerArn>` with the ARN of the load balancer you are interested in. This command will return a JSON object containing the attributes of the specified load balancer.

4. **Check the Security Policy**: In the JSON object returned by the previous command, look for the `Policies` field. This field contains a list of policy names associated with the load balancer. Check if the latest AWS security policy is in this list. If it is not, then the load balancer is not using the latest AWS security policy.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. You can do this using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, you need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating the files ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```
   ```
   [default]
   region=us-east-1
   ```

2. Create a Python script to list all ELBs and their associated SSL policies:
   You can use the following Python script to list all ELBs and their associated SSL policies:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_elbs():
       client = boto3.client('elbv2')
       elbs = client.describe_load_balancers()
       for elb in elbs['LoadBalancers']:
           if 'Certificates' in elb:
               for cert in elb['Certificates']:
                   if 'PolicyNames' in cert:
                       for policy in cert['PolicyNames']:
                           print(f"ELB: {elb['LoadBalancerName']}, SSL Policy: {policy}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       list_elbs()
   ```
   This script will print the name of each ELB and the name of its associated SSL policy.

3. Check the SSL policies against the latest AWS security policies:
   AWS provides a list of predefined security policies that you can use with your load balancer. You can check the SSL policy of each ELB against this list to see if it's using the latest policy. You can do this by modifying the above script as follows:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_elbs():
       client = boto3.client('elbv2')
       elbs = client.describe_load_balancers()
       for elb in elbs['LoadBalancers']:
           if 'Certificates' in elb:
               for cert in elb['Certificates']:
                   if 'PolicyNames' in cert:
                       for policy in cert['PolicyNames']:
                           if policy != 'ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08':  # replace with the name of the latest policy
                               print(f"ELB: {elb['LoadBalancerName']}, SSL Policy: {policy}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       list_elbs()
   ```
   This script will print the name of each ELB that is not using the latest SSL policy.

4. Run the Python script:
   Finally, you can run the Python script to check if all ELBs are using the latest AWS security policies. If any ELB is not using the latest policy, it will be printed out.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "ELBs Must Use Latest AWS Security Policies" for AWS, you can follow the below steps using the AWS Console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 service and select "Load Balancers" from the left-hand menu.
3. Select the ELB that needs to be remediated.
4. Click on the "Listeners" tab.
5. Check if the "HTTPS" protocol is being used. If it is, then click on the "Edit" button next to the listener.
6. Under "Security Policy", select the latest security policy from the drop-down list.
7. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you will remediate the misconfiguration "ELBs Must Use Latest AWS Security Policies" for AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "ELBs Must Use Latest AWS Security Policies" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Check the current security policy of the ELB using the following command:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancers --load-balancer-names <ELB_Name> --query "LoadBalancerDescriptions[].PolicyNames[]"
```

2. Check the latest security policy available using the following command:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancer-policies --policy-names AWSConsole-SSLNegotiationPolicy-2016-08
```

3. Create a new policy using the latest security policy available using the following command:

```
aws elb create-load-balancer-policy --load-balancer-name <ELB_Name> --policy-name AWSConsole-SSLNegotiationPolicy-2016-08 --policy-type-name SSLNegotiationPolicyType --policy-attributes AttributeName=Reference-Security-Policy,AttributeValue=ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01
```

4. Apply the newly created policy to the ELB using the following command:

```
aws elb set-load-balancer-policies-for-backend-server --load-balancer-name <ELB_Name> --instance-port 443 --policy-names AWSConsole-SSLNegotiationPolicy-2016-08
```

5. Verify that the new policy is applied to the ELB using the following command:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancers --load-balancer-names <ELB_Name> --query "LoadBalancerDescriptions[].PolicyNames[]"
```

After following these steps, the ELB will be using the latest AWS security policies.

#### Using Python

To remediate the ELBs Must Use Latest AWS Security Policies misconfiguration for AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed and configured on your local machine.

2. Next, you need to identify the ELBs that are not using the latest AWS security policies. You can do this by using the `describe_load_balancers` method of the `boto3.client('elbv2')` object. This method returns a list of all the load balancers in your account.

3. For each load balancer, you need to check if it is using the latest AWS security policy. You can do this by using the `describe_load_balancer_attributes` method of the `boto3.client('elbv2')` object. This method returns a dictionary of the load balancer attributes.

4. Check if the load balancer is using the latest security policy by looking for the `ssl_policy` attribute in the dictionary. If the value of this attribute is not `ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08`, then the load balancer is not using the latest security policy.

5. To update the load balancer to use the latest security policy, you can use the `modify_load_balancer_attributes` method of the `boto3.client('elbv2')` object. You need to set the `ssl_policy` attribute to `ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08`.

Here's the Python code to remediate the ELBs Must Use Latest AWS Security Policies misconfiguration:

```
import boto3

# create an ELB client object
elbv2 = boto3.client('elbv2')

# get a list of all the load balancers in your account
load_balancers = elbv2.describe_load_balancers()

# iterate through each load balancer
for lb in load_balancers['LoadBalancers']:
    # get the load balancer attributes
    lb_attributes = elbv2.describe_load_balancer_attributes(LoadBalancerArn=lb['LoadBalancerArn'])
    
    # check if the load balancer is using the latest security policy
    if lb_attributes['Attributes']['SslPolicy'] != 'ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08':
        # update the load balancer to use the latest security policy
        elbv2.modify_load_balancer_attributes(
            LoadBalancerArn=lb['LoadBalancerArn'],
            Attributes=[
                {
                    'Key': 'ssl_policy',
                    'Value': 'ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08'
                },
            ]
        )
```

Note: This code only updates the ELBs that are not using the latest AWS security policies. If all your ELBs are already using the latest security policy, then this code will not make any changes.
