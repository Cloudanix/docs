### Triage and Remediation
<Tabs>

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "Load Balancing", click on "Load Balancers".
3. Select the load balancer you want to inspect. In the "Description" tab below, find the "Listeners" section.
4. Check the "SSL Certificate" column. If the SSL certificate is not listed for the HTTPS or SSL protocols, it means that the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations is not being used.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the load balancers in your account using the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object with details about all your load balancers.

3. To check the SSL policies of each load balancer, you need to describe the listeners for each load balancer. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-listeners --load-balancer-arn <load-balancer-arn>
   ```

   Replace `<load-balancer-arn>` with the ARN of your load balancer. This command will return a JSON object with details about the listeners for your load balancer.

4. To specifically check the SSL policy, you need to look at the 'SslPolicy' field in the JSON object returned by the previous command. If the 'SslPolicy' field is not set to the latest security policy, then the load balancer is not using the latest SSL negotiations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3` in your terminal.

2. Import the necessary modules and establish a session with AWS using your credentials. Here's a basic setup:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Now, create a client for ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) and retrieve all the load balancers. Then, for each load balancer, retrieve its policies and check if the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations is used.

```python
elb = session.client('elbv2')

load_balancers = elb.describe_load_balancers()
for lb in load_balancers['LoadBalancers']:
    lb_arn = lb['LoadBalancerArn']
    policies = elb.describe_ssl_policies(LoadBalancerArn=lb_arn)
    for policy in policies['Policies']:
        if 'ELBSecurityPolicy' not in policy['PolicyName']:
            print(f"Load balancer {lb['LoadBalancerName']} is not using the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations.")
```

4. The above script will print out the names of all load balancers that are not using the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations. If no such load balancers are found, the script will not output anything. This way, you can easily detect any misconfigurations in your AWS Elastic Load Balancers.

Remember to replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'`, `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'`, and `'YOUR_REGION'` with your actual AWS access key, secret key, and region, respectively.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Latest AWS Security Policy for SSL Negotiations Should Be Used For App-Tier ELBs" in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Click on the "Load Balancers" link in the left-hand navigation menu.
4. Select the App-Tier ELB that needs remediation.
5. Click on the "Listeners" tab.
6. Select the HTTPS listener that needs remediation.
7. Click on the "Edit" button.
8. In the "Edit Listener" dialog box, select the latest AWS Security Policy from the "Security policy" drop-down menu.
9. Click the "Save" button to save the changes.

Once the above steps are completed, the App-Tier ELB will be configured to use the latest AWS Security Policy for SSL negotiations.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of using the latest AWS Security Policy for SSL negotiations for App-Tier ELBs in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to get the current SSL policy for your App-Tier ELB:

   ```
   aws elb describe-load-balancers --load-balancer-name <your-ELB-name> --query "LoadBalancerDescriptions[].ListenerDescriptions[].PolicyNames[]"
   ```

   Replace `<your-ELB-name>` with the name of your App-Tier ELB.

3. If the output includes any SSL policies other than the latest AWS Security Policy, you need to update the SSL policy. Run the following command to update the SSL policy for your App-Tier ELB:

   ```
   aws elb set-load-balancer-policies-of-listener --load-balancer-name <your-ELB-name> --load-balancer-port 443 --policy-names ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08
   ```

   Replace `<your-ELB-name>` with the name of your App-Tier ELB.

4. Verify that the SSL policy has been updated by running the command in step 2 again.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all App-Tier ELBs in your AWS environment.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of using the latest AWS Security Policy for SSL negotiations for App-Tier ELBs in AWS using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Latest AWS Security Policy for SSL Negotiations Should Be Used For App-Tier ELBs" in AWS using Python, follow the steps below:

1. Import the necessary AWS libraries and modules:

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Create an ELB client object:

```python
elb_client = boto3.client('elbv2')
```

3. Get a list of all the existing load balancers:

```python
response = elb_client.describe_load_balancers()
load_balancers = response['LoadBalancers']
```

4. Loop through the list of load balancers and check if they are application tier ELBs:

```python
for lb in load_balancers:
    if lb['Type'] == 'application':
        # Do something
```

5. Once you have identified the application tier ELBs, update their SSL policy to use the latest AWS security policy:

```python
try:
    response = elb_client.set_security_groups(
        LoadBalancerArn=lb['LoadBalancerArn'],
        SecurityGroups=[
            'security_group_id'
        ]
    )
except ClientError as e:
    print(e)
```

6. Replace `'security_group_id'` with the ID of the security group that you want to associate with the ELB.

7. Finally, run the Python script to remediate the misconfiguration.
