<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) from being accidentally deleted by enabling the deletion protection flag using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Load Balancer:**
   First, you need to identify the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the load balancer you want to protect. You can list all your load balancers using the following command:
   ```sh
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
   ```

2. **Enable Deletion Protection:**
   Use the `modify-load-balancer-attributes` command to enable deletion protection for the specified load balancer. Replace `<load-balancer-arn>` with the ARN of your load balancer.
   ```sh
   aws elbv2 modify-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <load-balancer-arn> --attributes Key=deletion_protection.enabled,Value=true
   ```

3. **Verify the Configuration:**
   To ensure that the deletion protection flag has been enabled, describe the load balancer attributes using the following command:
   ```sh
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <load-balancer-arn>
   ```
   Look for the `deletion_protection.enabled` attribute in the output and ensure its value is `true`.

4. **Automate for Multiple Load Balancers (Optional):**
   If you have multiple load balancers and want to enable deletion protection for all of them, you can use a loop in a shell script. Here is an example:
   ```sh
   for lb_arn in $(aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancers[*].LoadBalancerArn' --output text); do
       aws elbv2 modify-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn $lb_arn --attributes Key=deletion_protection.enabled,Value=true
   done
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that deletion protection is enabled for your Elastic Load Balancers, preventing accidental deletions.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration where Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) should have the Deletion Protection flag enabled in AWS, you can use the Boto3 library in Python. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Install Boto3 Library**:
   Ensure you have the Boto3 library installed. If not, you can install it using pip.
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by setting environment variables.

3. **Enable Deletion Protection for Existing ELBs**:
   Use the following Python script to enable deletion protection for all existing ELBs in your AWS account.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon EC2
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='YOUR_REGION'
   )

   # Initialize the ELB client
   elb_client = session.client('elb')

   # Get a list of all load balancers
   load_balancers = elb_client.describe_load_balancers()

   # Iterate through each load balancer and enable deletion protection
   for lb in load_balancers['LoadBalancerDescriptions']:
       lb_name = lb['LoadBalancerName']
       print(f"Enabling deletion protection for load balancer: {lb_name}")
       elb_client.modify_load_balancer_attributes(
           LoadBalancerName=lb_name,
           LoadBalancerAttributes={
               'DeletionProtection': {
                   'Enabled': True
               }
           }
       )
       print(f"Deletion protection enabled for load balancer: {lb_name}")
   ```

4. **Automate the Script**:
   To ensure that deletion protection is always enabled for new ELBs, you can automate the script to run periodically using a cron job or AWS Lambda. Here is an example of how you can set up a cron job on a Unix-based system:

   ```bash
   # Open the crontab file
   crontab -e

   # Add the following line to run the script every day at midnight
   0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that the Deletion Protection flag is enabled for all your ELBs, preventing accidental deletion.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu, then choosing "EC2" under the "Compute" category.
3. In the EC2 Dashboard, under the "Load Balancing" section in the left-hand navigation pane, click on "Load Balancers".
4. In the Load Balancers page, select the load balancer you want to check. In the "Description" tab below, look for the "Attributes" section. Here, you can see if the "Deletion Protection" flag is enabled or not.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all the Load Balancers: Use the following command to list all the load balancers in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the load balancers.

3. Extract Load Balancer ARNs: From the JSON output, extract the ARN of each load balancer. You can use the following command to do this:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancers[*].[LoadBalancerArn]' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the load balancer ARNs.

4. Check Deletion Protection Flag: For each load balancer ARN, use the following command to check if the deletion protection flag is enabled:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <load-balancer-arn>
   ```
   Replace `<load-balancer-arn>` with the ARN of the load balancer you want to check. This command will return a JSON output with the attributes of the load balancer. If the deletion protection flag is enabled, the `delete_protection.enabled` attribute will be set to `true`. If it's not, then the load balancer is misconfigured.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install Boto3 in your environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials either by setting environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, or by creating the credentials file at `~/.aws/credentials`.

2. Import necessary libraries and create a session:
   Import the Boto3 library in your Python script and create a session using your AWS credentials.
   ```python
   import boto3
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       aws_session_token='SESSION_TOKEN',
   )
   ```

3. Get a list of all ELBs and check the deletion protection attribute:
   Use the `describe_load_balancers` method to get a list of all ELBs. Then, for each ELB, use the `describe_load_balancer_attributes` method to get its attributes and check if the `deletion_protection.enabled` attribute is set to `True`.
   ```python
   elbv2 = session.client('elbv2')
   elbs = elbv2.describe_load_balancers()
   for elb in elbs['LoadBalancers']:
       attributes = elbv2.describe_load_balancer_attributes(LoadBalancerArn=elb['LoadBalancerArn'])
       for attr in attributes['Attributes']:
           if attr['Key'] == 'deletion_protection.enabled':
               print(f"ELB {elb['LoadBalancerName']} has deletion protection enabled: {attr['Value']}")
   ```

4. Analyze the output:
   The script will print the name of each ELB and whether it has deletion protection enabled. If the value is `False`, it means the ELB does not have deletion protection enabled and is potentially misconfigured.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of ELBs not having deletion protection flag enabled, you can use the following steps in Python:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK modules:

```
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Initialize a boto3 client for Elastic Load Balancing:

```
elb_client = boto3.client('elbv2')
```

3. Get a list of all the existing ELBs in your AWS account:

```
try:
    response = elb_client.describe_load_balancers()
    elbs = response['LoadBalancers']
except ClientError as e:
    print(e)
```

4. For each ELB, check if the deletion protection flag is enabled. If not, enable it:

```
for elb in elbs:
    elb_name = elb['LoadBalancerName']
    try:
        response = elb_client.modify_load_balancer_attributes(
            LoadBalancerArn=elb['LoadBalancerArn'],
            Attributes=[
                {
                    'Key': 'deletion_protection.enabled',
                    'Value': 'true'
                }
            ]
        )
        print(f"Deletion protection enabled for ELB {elb_name}")
    except ClientError as e:
        print(e)
```

5. Run the Python script to enable deletion protection for all the ELBs in your AWS account.

Note: You will need to have appropriate IAM permissions to modify the load balancer attributes.
