1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "Load Balancing", click on "Load Balancers".
3. Select the Application Load Balancer (ALB) that you want to check.
4. In the bottom panel, click on the "Attributes" tab. Here, you can see the "Desync Mitigation Mode" attribute. If it's not set, then it's a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, make sure you have AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions. You can install it using pip (Python package installer). 

   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Then configure it using the following command and provide your AWS credentials (Access key ID, Secret access key, Default region name, Default output format).

   ```
   aws configure
   ```

2. List all the Application Load Balancers: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in your account.

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancers[?Type==`application`].LoadBalancerArn'
   ```

3. Describe Load Balancer Attributes: For each ALB, describe the load balancer attributes using the following command. Replace 'your-load-balancer-arn' with the ARN of your load balancer.

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn your-load-balancer-arn
   ```

4. Check Desync Mitigation Mode: In the output of the above command, look for the attribute 'routing.http.desync-mitigation-mode'. If it is not set to 'defensive' or 'strictest', then the ALB is misconfigured.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   First, you need to install Boto3. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3`. After installing Boto3, you need to configure it. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. Import necessary libraries and create a session:
   In your Python script, you need to import the Boto3 library and create a session using your AWS credentials.

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ```

3. Create an ELB client and retrieve all load balancers:
   Using the session you created, you can create an ELB client and then use that client to retrieve all of your load balancers.

   ```python
   elb = session.client('elbv2')
   load_balancers = elb.describe_load_balancers()
   ```

4. Check the Desync Mitigation Mode of each load balancer:
   You can then iterate over each load balancer and check its Desync Mitigation Mode. If the Desync Mitigation Mode is not set, you have detected a misconfiguration.

   ```python
   for lb in load_balancers['LoadBalancers']:
       attributes = elb.describe_load_balancer_attributes(LoadBalancerArn=lb['LoadBalancerArn'])
       for attr in attributes['Attributes']:
           if attr['Key'] == 'routing.http.desync_mitigation_mode':
               if attr['Value'] != 'defensive':
                   print(f"ALB {lb['LoadBalancerName']} has Desync Mitigation Mode not set")
   ```
   
Please replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your actual AWS access key and secret key.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of ALB with Desync Mitigation Mode in AWS Elastic Load Balancer using the AWS console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in to your account.

2. **Navigate to EC2 Dashboard**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page, select "EC2" under the "Compute" section.

3. **Go to Load Balancers**: In the EC2 Dashboard, under the "Load Balancing" section in the navigation pane, click on "Load Balancers".

4. **Select the ALB**: Select the Application Load Balancer (ALB) that you want to remediate with Desync Mitigation Mode.

5. **Edit Attributes**: In the description tab of the selected ALB, click on the "Attributes" tab.

6. **Enable Desync Mitigation Mode**: Scroll down to find the "Desync Mitigation Mode" attribute and click on the "Edit" button next to it.

7. **Set Desync Mitigation Mode**: In the dropdown menu that appears, select the appropriate option for Desync Mitigation Mode. You can choose between "Defensive" and "Strict" mode based on your requirements. 

8. **Save Changes**: After selecting the desired Desync Mitigation Mode, click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

9. **Review Configuration**: Verify that the Desync Mitigation Mode has been successfully set for the ALB by checking the attribute settings.

10. **Test the ALB**: It is recommended to perform thorough testing of your ALB after making configuration changes to ensure that the Desync Mitigation Mode is functioning as expected.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of ALB with Desync Mitigation Mode in AWS Elastic Load Balancer using the AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of ALB with Desync Mitigation Mode not being set in AWS Elastic Load Balancer using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and ensure that you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions to modify Elastic Load Balancers.

2. Run the following AWS CLI command to enable Desync Mitigation Mode for your Application Load Balancer (ALB):
   
```bash
aws elbv2 modify-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <YOUR_ALB_ARN> --attributes Key=deletion_protection.enabled,Value=true Key=desync-mitigation-mode.enabled,Value=true
```

Replace `<YOUR_ALB_ARN>` with the ARN of your ALB.

3. Verify that the Desync Mitigation Mode has been successfully enabled by describing the load balancer attributes using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <YOUR_ALB_ARN>
```

Ensure that the `desync-mitigation-mode.enabled` attribute is set to `true` in the output.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of ALB with Desync Mitigation Mode not being set in AWS Elastic Load Balancer using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of ALB with Desync Mitigation Mode not being set in AWS Elastic Load Balancer using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update the ALB settings. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this issue:

1. Install Boto3:
Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

2. Configure AWS Credentials:
Make sure you have configured AWS credentials with the necessary permissions to update the ALB settings. You can do this by setting up the AWS CLI or by setting environment variables with access key and secret key.

3. Write Python Script:
Create a Python script with the following code to update the ALB settings with Desync Mitigation Mode enabled:

```python
import boto3

# Define the ALB ARN and Desync Mitigation Mode
alb_arn = 'YOUR_ALB_ARN'
desync_mode = 'monitor'  # Options: monitor | defensive | strict

# Create a Boto3 client for Elastic Load Balancing
elbv2_client = boto3.client('elbv2')

# Update the ALB settings with Desync Mitigation Mode
response = elbv2_client.modify_load_balancer_attributes(
    LoadBalancerArn=alb_arn,
    Attributes=[
        {
            'Key': 'routing.http.desyncmitigationmode',
            'Value': desync_mode
        },
    ]
)

print("ALB Desync Mitigation Mode set to:", desync_mode)
```

4. Replace 'YOUR_ALB_ARN' with the actual ARN of your ALB.
You can find the ARN of your ALB in the AWS Management Console or by using the describe_load_balancers() method in Boto3.

5. Run the Script:
Save the Python script and run it using Python. This will update the ALB settings with the Desync Mitigation Mode enabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of ALB with Desync Mitigation Mode not being set in AWS Elastic Load Balancer using Python.
