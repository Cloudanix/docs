### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent the use of Classic Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in AWS using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard:**
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - In the top navigation bar, select "Services" and then choose "EC2" under the "Compute" section.

2. **Access Load Balancers:**
   - In the left-hand navigation pane, scroll down to the "Load Balancing" section and click on "Load Balancers."

3. **Identify Classic Load Balancers:**
   - In the Load Balancers list, look for any load balancers with the "classic" type. You can filter by "Load Balancer type" to quickly identify Classic Load Balancers.

4. **Create and Use Application/Network Load Balancers:**
   - Instead of using Classic Load Balancers, create new Application Load Balancers (ALBs) or Network Load Balancers (NLBs) as needed.
   - Click on the "Create Load Balancer" button and choose either "Application Load Balancer" or "Network Load Balancer" based on your requirements.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to configure and deploy the new load balancer.

By following these steps, you can ensure that you are not using Classic ELBs and are instead utilizing the more modern and feature-rich Application or Network Load Balancers.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the use of Classic Load Balancers (CLBs) in AWS and ensure that only Application Load Balancers (ALBs) or Network Load Balancers (NLBs) are used, you can follow these steps using the AWS CLI:

1. **List Existing Load Balancers**:
   First, identify any existing Classic Load Balancers in your account.
   ```sh
   aws elb describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancerDescriptions[*].LoadBalancerName'
   ```

2. **Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:
   If you need to create a new load balancer, ensure you create an ALB instead of a CLB.
   ```sh
   aws elbv2 create-load-balancer --name my-alb --subnets subnet-12345678 subnet-87654321 --security-groups sg-12345678 --scheme internet-facing --type application
   ```

3. **Create a Network Load Balancer (NLB)**:
   Alternatively, if you need a Network Load Balancer, use the following command.
   ```sh
   aws elbv2 create-load-balancer --name my-nlb --subnets subnet-12345678 subnet-87654321 --scheme internet-facing --type network
   ```

4. **Tagging and Policy Enforcement**:
   Use AWS Config rules to enforce the policy that no Classic Load Balancers should be in use. You can create a custom AWS Config rule or use a managed rule to check for the presence of CLBs.
   ```sh
   aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule file://config-rule.json
   ```
   Example `config-rule.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "ConfigRuleName": "no-classic-elb",
     "Description": "Ensure no Classic Load Balancers are in use",
     "Scope": {
       "ComplianceResourceTypes": [
         "AWS::ElasticLoadBalancing::LoadBalancer"
       ]
     },
     "Source": {
       "Owner": "AWS",
       "SourceIdentifier": "ELB_CLASSIC_LOAD_BALANCER_DEPRECATED"
     }
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you can prevent the use of Classic Load Balancers and ensure that only ALBs or NLBs are used in your AWS environment.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the use of Classic Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in AWS using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here are the steps to ensure that no Classic ELBs are in use:

### Step 1: Install Boto3
First, ensure that you have Boto3 installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

### Step 2: Initialize Boto3 Client
Initialize the Boto3 client for Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Elastic Load Balancing v2 (ELBv2):
```python
import boto3

# Initialize the ELB client
elb_client = boto3.client('elb')

# Initialize the ELBv2 client
elbv2_client = boto3.client('elbv2')
```

### Step 3: List and Check Classic ELBs
List all Classic ELBs and check if any are in use:
```python
def list_classic_elbs():
    response = elb_client.describe_load_balancers()
    classic_elbs = response.get('LoadBalancerDescriptions', [])
    return classic_elbs

classic_elbs = list_classic_elbs()
if classic_elbs:
    print("Classic ELBs in use:")
    for elb in classic_elbs:
        print(elb['LoadBalancerName'])
else:
    print("No Classic ELBs in use.")
```

### Step 4: Automate the Prevention
To automate the prevention of creating new Classic ELBs, you can create a script that checks for Classic ELBs and alerts or deletes them if found. Here is an example of how you might delete Classic ELBs:
```python
def delete_classic_elbs():
    classic_elbs = list_classic_elbs()
    if classic_elbs:
        for elb in classic_elbs:
            elb_name = elb['LoadBalancerName']
            print(f"Deleting Classic ELB: {elb_name}")
            elb_client.delete_load_balancer(LoadBalancerName=elb_name)
    else:
        print("No Classic ELBs to delete.")

# Call the function to delete Classic ELBs
delete_classic_elbs()
```

### Summary
1. **Install Boto3**: Ensure Boto3 is installed.
2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**: Set up the ELB and ELBv2 clients.
3. **List and Check Classic ELBs**: List all Classic ELBs and check if any are in use.
4. **Automate the Prevention**: Create a script to delete Classic ELBs if found.

By following these steps, you can prevent the use of Classic ELBs in your AWS environment using Python scripts.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

2. In the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.

3. In the Load Balancer type column, you can see the type of each load balancer. If any of them are listed as "Classic Load Balancer", it indicates that a Classic ELB is in use.

4. For a more detailed view, select the Classic Load Balancer. In the Description tab below, you can see more details about the selected load balancer.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all Classic Load Balancers: Run the following command to list all the Classic Load Balancers in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws elb describe-load-balancers
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with the details of all the Classic Load Balancers.

3. Parse the output: You can parse the output using a tool like jq to get the names of the Classic Load Balancers. Here is an example command:

   ```
   aws elb describe-load-balancers | jq -r '.LoadBalancerDescriptions[].LoadBalancerName'
   ```

4. Check for Classic Load Balancers: If the above command returns any names, it means that there are Classic Load Balancers in use. If it doesn't return any names, it means that there are no Classic Load Balancers in use.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Create an ELB client using the session:

```python
elb = session.client('elbv2')
```

4. Now, you can use the `describe_load_balancers` function to get a list of all load balancers. Then, iterate over the list and check the `Type` of each load balancer. If the type is `classic`, then it's a misconfiguration:

```python
response = elb.describe_load_balancers()

for lb in response['LoadBalancers']:
    if lb['Type'] == 'classic':
        print(f"Misconfiguration detected: Classic ELB in use - {lb['LoadBalancerName']}")
```

This script will print the names of all classic ELBs in use. If there are no classic ELBs, it won't print anything.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the "No Classic ELB Should Be In Use" misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. List all the classic load balancers in your AWS account using the following command:

   ```
   aws elb describe-load-balancers --query "LoadBalancerDescriptions[?Scheme=='internet-facing']"
   ```

2. Identify the classic load balancers that are currently in use and need to be replaced with ALB/NLB.

3. Create a new ALB/NLB based on your requirements using the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 create-load-balancer --name <load-balancer-name> --type <load-balancer-type> --subnets <subnet-ids> --security-groups <security-group-ids>
   ```

4. Update the DNS records to point to the new ALB/NLB.

5. Update the target groups and listeners of the classic load balancers to the new ALB/NLB using the following commands:

   ```
   aws elbv2 create-target-group --name <target-group-name> --protocol <protocol> --port <port> --vpc-id <vpc-id>
   aws elbv2 create-listener --load-balancer-arn <load-balancer-arn> --protocol <protocol> --port <port> --default-actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=<target-group-arn>
   ```

6. Deregister and delete the classic load balancers using the following commands:

   ```
   aws elb deregister-instances-from-load-balancer --load-balancer-name <load-balancer-name> --instances <instance-ids>
   aws elb delete-load-balancer --load-balancer-name <load-balancer-name>
   ```

7. Verify that the new ALB/NLB is functioning properly and all the traffic is being routed to it.

Note: Before deleting the classic load balancers, ensure that they are not being used by any other resources or services in your AWS account.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "No Classic ELB Should Be In Use" for AWS using Python, you can use the following steps:

1. Import the required AWS SDK and Boto3 library to interact with AWS resources.
```
import boto3
```

2. Create a client object for Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) using Boto3.
```
elb_client = boto3.client('elb')
```

3. Use the describe_load_balancers() method to get a list of all the load balancers in your AWS account.
```
load_balancers = elb_client.describe_load_balancers()
```

4. Loop through the list of load balancers and check if any of them are Classic load balancers.
```
for lb in load_balancers['LoadBalancerDescriptions']:
    if lb['Scheme'] == 'internet-facing' and lb['Type'] == 'classic':
        print('Classic ELB found: ' + lb['LoadBalancerName'])
```

5. If a Classic ELB is found, use the delete_load_balancer() method to delete it.
```
elb_client.delete_load_balancer(LoadBalancerName=lb['LoadBalancerName'])
```

6. Optionally, you can add a confirmation prompt before deleting the Classic ELB to avoid accidental deletion.
```
response = input('Do you want to delete the Classic ELB ' + lb['LoadBalancerName'] + '? (y/n) ')
if response.lower() == 'y':
    elb_client.delete_load_balancer(LoadBalancerName=lb['LoadBalancerName'])
else:
    print('Classic ELB ' + lb['LoadBalancerName'] + ' was not deleted.')
```

7. Run the Python script to identify and delete any Classic ELBs in your AWS account.

Note: Before running the script, make sure you have the necessary permissions to delete Classic ELBs in your AWS account.
