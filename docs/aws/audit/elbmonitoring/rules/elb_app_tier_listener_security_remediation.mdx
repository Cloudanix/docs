### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu and then selecting "EC2" under the "Compute" section.
3. In the EC2 Dashboard, under the "Load Balancing" section in the left navigation pane, click on "Load Balancers".
4. In the Load Balancers page, select the load balancer you want to inspect. In the bottom panel, click on the "Listeners" tab. Here, you can see the protocols and ports configured for your load balancer. If the listeners are not using secure protocols (HTTPS or SSL), then it's a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the load balancers in your account using the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the load balancers.

3. To check the listeners for a specific load balancer, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-listeners --load-balancer-arn <load-balancer-arn>
   ```

   Replace `<load-balancer-arn>` with the ARN of the load balancer you want to check. This command will return a JSON output with details of all the listeners associated with the specified load balancer.

4. To check if the listeners are secure, you need to look for the `Protocol` field in the output. If the protocol is `HTTPS` or `TLS`, then the listener is secure. If the protocol is `HTTP`, then the listener is not secure. You can use a tool like `jq` to parse the JSON output and filter the results. For example:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-listeners --load-balancer-arn <load-balancer-arn> | jq '.Listeners[] | select(.Protocol=="HTTP")'
   ```

   This command will return the details of all the insecure listeners. If the command returns no output, then all the listeners are secure.

#### Using Python

To check if Secure Listeners are in App-tier ELBs in Elastic Load Balancer using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the Boto3 library and create an AWS session:**

    Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You need to import it and create a session using your AWS credentials.

    ```python
    import boto3

    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
        region_name='us-west-2'
    )
    ```

2. **Create an ELB client and retrieve all the load balancers:**

    Use the session to create an ELB client. Then, use the describe_load_balancers() method to retrieve all the load balancers.

    ```python
    elb_client = session.client('elbv2')
    load_balancers = elb_client.describe_load_balancers()
    ```

3. **Iterate over each load balancer and check the listeners:**

    For each load balancer, use the describe_listeners() method to get all the listeners. Then, check if the protocol of each listener is HTTPS. If it's not, it means the listener is not secure.

    ```python
    for load_balancer in load_balancers['LoadBalancers']:
        listeners = elb_client.describe_listeners(LoadBalancerArn=load_balancer['LoadBalancerArn'])
        for listener in listeners['Listeners']:
            if listener['Protocol'] != 'HTTPS':
                print(f"Load balancer {load_balancer['LoadBalancerName']} has insecure listener {listener['ListenerArn']}")
    ```

4. **Run the script:**

    Save the script and run it. It will print the names and ARNs of the load balancers that have insecure listeners.

Please replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your actual AWS access key and secret key.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

The remediation steps for this misconfiguration in AWS using AWS console are as follows:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. Select the Load Balancers option from the left-hand menu.
3. Identify the application load balancer (ALB) or network load balancer (NLB) that is serving traffic to the application tier.
4. Click on the name of the load balancer to open its details page.
5. Click on the Listeners tab.
6. Identify the listener that is not secure and needs to be secured.
7. Click on the Edit button for that listener.
8. Change the protocol to HTTPS or TLS, depending on your application's requirements.
9. Select the SSL/TLS certificate that you want to use for securing the listener.
10. Click on the Save button to save the changes.

After following these steps, the listener for the application tier will be secured with SSL/TLS encryption.

#### Using CLI

The misconfiguration "Secure Listeners Should Be In App-tier ELBs" means that secure listeners should be configured only in the application tier Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) and not in any other ELBs. To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Identify the ELBs in your AWS account that are not in the application tier and have secure listeners configured. You can use the following AWS CLI command to list all the ELBs in your account:

```
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
```

2. From the list of ELBs, identify the ones that are not in the application tier and have secure listeners configured. 

3. Remove the secure listeners from the non-application tier ELBs using the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws elbv2 delete-listener --listener-arn <listener-arn>
```

Replace `<listener-arn>` with the ARN of the listener that you want to delete.

4. If required, create secure listeners in the application tier ELBs using the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws elbv2 create-listener --load-balancer-arn <load-balancer-arn> --protocol HTTPS --port 443 --ssl-policy ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08
```

Replace `<load-balancer-arn>` with the ARN of the application tier ELB.

5. Verify that all the secure listeners are configured only in the application tier ELBs by running the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws elbv2 describe-listeners
```

This will list all the listeners in your account. Verify that all the secure listeners are configured only in the application tier ELBs.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Secure Listeners Should Be In App-tier ELBs" in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Secure Listeners Should Be In App-tier ELBs" in AWS using python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Identify the app-tier ELBs: Identify the ELBs that are part of the application tier and store their names in a list.

```
import boto3

elb_client = boto3.client('elbv2')
app_elbs = []

response = elb_client.describe_load_balancers()
for elb in response['LoadBalancers']:
    tags = elb_client.describe_tags(ResourceArns=[elb['LoadBalancerArn']])
    for tag in tags['TagDescriptions'][0]['Tags']:
        if tag['Key'] == 'tier' and tag['Value'] == 'app':
            app_elbs.append(elb['LoadBalancerArn'])
```

2. Identify the secure listeners: Identify the listeners that are using secure protocols like HTTPS, SSL, TLS, etc. and store their names in a list.

```
secure_listeners = []

response = elb_client.describe_listeners()
for listener in response['Listeners']:
    if listener['Protocol'] in ['HTTPS', 'SSL', 'TLS']:
        secure_listeners.append(listener['ListenerArn'])
```

3. Check if secure listeners are attached to app-tier ELBs: Check if the secure listeners identified in step 2 are attached to the ELBs identified in step 1. If any secure listener is not attached to any app-tier ELB, then update its configuration and attach it to an app-tier ELB.

```
for listener in secure_listeners:
    response = elb_client.describe_listener_certificates(ListenerArn=listener)
    if response['Certificates']:
        elb_arn = response['Certificates'][0]['CertificateArn'].split('/')[1]
        if elb_arn not in app_elbs:
            elb_client.modify_listener(
                ListenerArn=listener,
                LoadBalancerArn=app_elbs[0],
                Port=443,
                Protocol='HTTPS'
            )
```

4. Verify the remediation: Verify that all secure listeners are attached to app-tier ELBs by running the code in step 2 again.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Secure Listeners Should Be In App-tier ELBs" in AWS using python.
