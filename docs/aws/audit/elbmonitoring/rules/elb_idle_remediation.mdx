### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

2. In the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.

3. The console displays a list of your load balancers. If a load balancer does not have any instances registered to it or if the instances are not passing health checks, it is considered idle.

4. To check the health of the instances registered to a load balancer, select the load balancer and then choose the Instances tab. The Status column shows the status of each instance. If the status is OutOfService, the instance is not passing health checks.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by downloading the appropriate installer from the AWS CLI website. Once installed, you can configure it by running `aws configure` and providing your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all ELBs: Use the following command to list all the Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object with information about all your ELBs.

3. Check for idle ELBs: An ELB is considered idle if it has no registered instances or if the instances are not passing health checks. You can check this by running the following command for each ELB:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn <TargetGroupArn>
   ```

   Replace `<TargetGroupArn>` with the ARN of the target group associated with the ELB. This command will return a JSON object with information about the health of the targets. If the `TargetHealthDescriptions` array is empty or all the targets have `State` as `unhealthy`, the ELB is idle.

4. Automate the process: You can automate the process of checking for idle ELBs by writing a Python script that uses the boto3 library to interact with the AWS API. The script would list all ELBs, check the target health for each one, and print out the ARNs of the idle ELBs.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:
```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and establish a session with AWS using your credentials. You can do this by setting up your credentials file at ~/.aws/credentials. After that, you can establish a session using the following script:
```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Now, create a client for 'elbv2' which stands for Elastic Load Balancer V2. Then, use the 'describe_load_balancers' function to get a list of all the load balancers. 
```python
elb = session.client('elbv2')
response = elb.describe_load_balancers()
```

4. Iterate over the list of load balancers and for each load balancer, use the 'describe_target_health' function to get the health of the targets. If the 'TargetHealthDescriptions' field is empty for a load balancer, it means that the load balancer is idle. Here is the script to do this:
```python
for lb in response['LoadBalancers']:
    target_health = elb.describe_target_health(
        TargetGroupArn=lb['TargetGroupsArn']
    )
    if not target_health['TargetHealthDescriptions']:
        print(f"Idle Load Balancer: {lb['LoadBalancerArn']}")
```
This script will print the ARN of all the idle load balancers.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "No Idle ELBs Should Be Present" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console, please follow the below steps:

1. Login to your AWS console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.

2. Click on the "Load Balancers" link under the "Network & Security" section.

3. Identify the idle ELBs by checking the "Status" column. If an ELB is idle, it will have a status of "Active (Idle)".

4. Click on the idle ELB that you want to remediate.

5. Click on the "Instances" tab and check if there are any instances attached to the ELB.

6. If there are no instances attached, then click on the "Delete" button to delete the idle ELB.

7. If there are instances attached, then click on the "Deregister" button to remove the instances from the ELB.

8. Once all instances have been removed, click on the "Delete" button to delete the idle ELB.

9. Repeat steps 4-8 for all idle ELBs.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the "No Idle ELBs Should Be Present" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of having no idle ELBs present in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the idle ELBs present in your AWS account by running the following AWS CLI command:
```
aws elb describe-load-balancers --query "LoadBalancerDescriptions[?Instances == null].LoadBalancerName"
```

2. Once you have identified the idle ELBs, delete them using the following AWS CLI command:
```
aws elb delete-load-balancer --load-balancer-name <load_balancer_name>
```
Replace `<load_balancer_name>` with the name of the idle ELB that you want to delete.

3. Confirm the deletion by running the following AWS CLI command:
```
aws elb describe-load-balancers --query "LoadBalancerDescriptions[?LoadBalancerName == '<load_balancer_name>']"
```
Replace `<load_balancer_name>` with the name of the idle ELB that you deleted. If the command returns an empty array, it means that the idle ELB has been successfully deleted.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all the idle ELBs identified in step 1.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having no idle ELBs present in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "No Idle ELBs Should Be Present" misconfiguration in AWS using python, follow these steps:

Step 1: Import the necessary libraries and configure your AWS credentials.

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='your_access_key',
    aws_secret_access_key='your_secret_key',
    region_name='your_region'
)

elb = session.client('elbv2')
```

Step 2: Get a list of all the load balancers in your account.

```python
response = elb.describe_load_balancers()
load_balancers = response['LoadBalancers']
```

Step 3: Loop through the list of load balancers and check if any of them are idle. If an idle load balancer is found, delete it.

```python
for lb in load_balancers:
    lb_arn = lb['LoadBalancerArn']
    response = elb.describe_target_health(TargetGroupArn=lb_arn)
    target_health_states = response['TargetHealthDescriptions']
    
    if not target_health_states:
        elb.delete_load_balancer(LoadBalancerArn=lb_arn)
```

Step 4: Run the script to remediate the misconfiguration.

Note: This script will delete any idle load balancers in your account. Make sure you understand the consequences before running it.

That's it! This script will remediate the "No Idle ELBs Should Be Present" misconfiguration in AWS.
