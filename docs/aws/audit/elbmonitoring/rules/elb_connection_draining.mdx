1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.

3. Select the load balancer that you want to check.

4. In the bottom panel, select the "Description" tab.

5. In the "Attributes" section, look for "Connection Draining". If it is enabled, you will see the duration for which the load balancer will try to keep connections alive before fully closing them. If it is not enabled, it will be stated there.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all the Load Balancers: Use the following command to list all the load balancers in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the load balancers.

3. Extract Load Balancer ARNs: From the JSON output, extract the ARN of each load balancer. You can use the following command to do this:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancers[*].[LoadBalancerArn]' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the load balancer ARNs.

4. Check Connection Draining: For each load balancer ARN, use the following command to check if connection draining is enabled:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <LoadBalancerArn>
   ```
   Replace `<LoadBalancerArn>` with the ARN of the load balancer you want to check. This command will return a JSON output with the attributes of the load balancer. If connection draining is enabled, the `ConnectionDraining.Enabled` attribute will be `true`. If it's not, then the load balancer is misconfigured.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Create an ELB client and retrieve all the load balancers:

```python
elb = session.client('elb')

load_balancers = elb.describe_load_balancers()
```

4. Iterate over the load balancers and check if connection draining is enabled:

```python
for lb in load_balancers['LoadBalancerDescriptions']:
    attributes = elb.describe_load_balancer_attributes(LoadBalancerName=lb['LoadBalancerName'])
    if 'ConnectionDraining' in attributes['LoadBalancerAttributes']:
        if not attributes['LoadBalancerAttributes']['ConnectionDraining']['Enabled']:
            print(f"Connection Draining is not enabled for {lb['LoadBalancerName']}")
```

This script will print the names of all load balancers that do not have connection draining enabled.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration of ELBs not having Connection Draining enabled in AWS console:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.

2. From the left-hand menu, click on the "Load Balancers" option.

3. Select the ELB that you want to remediate from the list of available load balancers.

4. Click on the "Attributes" tab from the bottom panel.

5. Under the "Connection Settings" section, click on the "Edit" button.

6. In the "Edit Connection Settings" window, check the box next to "Enable Connection Draining".

7. Set the "Connection Draining Timeout" value to the desired number of seconds (e.g., 300 seconds).

8. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

9. Verify that the "Connection Draining" attribute is now enabled for the selected ELB.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of ELBs not having Connection Draining enabled in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "ELBs Should Have Connection Draining Enabled" in AWS using AWS CLI, please follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

Step 2: Run the following command to enable connection draining for an existing ELB:

```
aws elb modify-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-name <ELB_Name> --load-balancer-attributes "{\"ConnectionDraining\":{\"Enabled\":true,\"Timeout\":300}}"
```

Note: Replace `<ELB_Name>` with the name of your ELB.

Step 3: Verify the connection draining is enabled by running the following command:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-name <ELB_Name> --query 'LoadBalancerAttributes.ConnectionDraining'
```

Note: Replace `<ELB_Name>` with the name of your ELB.

If the output of the above command shows "Enabled": true, then the connection draining is enabled for your ELB.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "ELBs Should Have Connection Draining Enabled" in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the "ELBs Should Have Connection Draining Enabled" misconfiguration in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. First, import the necessary AWS SDK libraries in your Python script. You will need `boto3` and `botocore` libraries.

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Next, create a `boto3` client for the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service.

```python
elb_client = boto3.client('elb')
```

3. Retrieve a list of all the ELBs in your AWS account using the `describe_load_balancers()` method.

```python
response = elb_client.describe_load_balancers()
load_balancers = response['LoadBalancerDescriptions']
```

4. For each ELB in the list, check if Connection Draining is enabled by calling the `describe_load_balancer_attributes()` method.

```python
for lb in load_balancers:
    lb_name = lb['LoadBalancerName']
    response = elb_client.describe_load_balancer_attributes(LoadBalancerName=lb_name)
    attrs = response['LoadBalancerAttributes']
    if 'ConnectionDraining' not in attrs or not attrs['ConnectionDraining']['Enabled']:
        # Connection Draining is not enabled. Remediate the misconfiguration.
```

5. If Connection Draining is not enabled, use the `modify_load_balancer_attributes()` method to enable it.

```python
elb_client.modify_load_balancer_attributes(
    LoadBalancerName=lb_name,
    LoadBalancerAttributes={
        'ConnectionDraining': {
            'Enabled': True,
            'Timeout': 300 # Set the timeout value in seconds
        }
    }
)
```

6. Finally, add appropriate logging and error handling to your script.

```python
try:
    # Put the above code here
except ClientError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

With these steps, you can remediate the "ELBs Should Have Connection Draining Enabled" misconfiguration in AWS using Python.
