### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu and then selecting "EC2" under the "Compute" category.
3. In the EC2 Dashboard, under the "Load Balancing" section in the left-hand navigation pane, click on "Load Balancers".
4. Select the Load Balancer you want to check. In the bottom panel, click on the "Attributes" tab. Here, you can see if the "Access logs" are enabled or not. If the "Access logs" field is set to "Disabled", then logging is not enabled for the selected Elastic Load Balancer.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all the Load Balancers: Use the following command to list all the load balancers in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the load balancers.

3. Extract Load Balancer ARNs: From the JSON output, extract the ARN of each load balancer. You can use the following command to do this:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancers[*].[LoadBalancerArn]' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the load balancer ARNs.

4. Check if Logging is Enabled: For each load balancer ARN, use the following command to check if logging is enabled:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <LoadBalancerArn>
   ```
   Replace `<LoadBalancerArn>` with the ARN of the load balancer you want to check. If logging is enabled, the `access_logs.s3.enabled` attribute in the JSON output will be set to `true`. If it's set to `false` or the attribute is not present, then logging is not enabled for that load balancer.

#### Using Python

To check if Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) has logging enabled using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to directly interact with AWS services, including ELB. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the Boto3 library in Python:**
   Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. To use Boto3, you first need to import it.

   ```python
   import boto3
   ```

2. **Create an AWS session:**
   This is needed to create a connection with AWS services. You can create a session using your AWS credentials.

   ```python
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ```

3. **Create an ELB client:**
   Using the session created in the previous step, you can create an ELB client. This client will provide you with methods to interact with ELB.

   ```python
   elb = session.client('elbv2')
   ```

4. **Check if logging is enabled:**
   You can use the `describe_load_balancer_attributes` method provided by the ELB client to get the attributes of a load balancer. If the `access_logs.s3.enabled` attribute is `true`, then logging is enabled.

   ```python
   def is_logging_enabled(load_balancer_arn):
       response = elb.describe_load_balancer_attributes(LoadBalancerArn=load_balancer_arn)
       attributes = response['Attributes']
       for attribute in attributes:
           if attribute['Key'] == 'access_logs.s3.enabled':
               return attribute['Value'] == 'true'
       return False
   ```

   This function takes the ARN of a load balancer as an argument and returns `True` if logging is enabled and `False` otherwise. You can get the ARN of a load balancer using the `describe_load_balancers` method of the ELB client.

Please replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'` and `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'` with your actual AWS access key and secret key. Also, replace `'us-west-2'` with the region you are working in.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of ELB not having logging enabled in AWS, you can follow the below steps using the AWS Console:

1. Login to your AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.

2. From the EC2 Dashboard, click on the Load Balancers link located on the left side of the page.

3. Select the Load Balancer that you want to enable logging for.

4. Click on the Edit Attributes button located at the bottom of the page.

5. In the Edit Attributes window, scroll down to the Access Logs section.

6. Select the Enable Access Logs checkbox.

7. In the S3 Bucket field, enter the name of the S3 bucket where you want to store the access logs.

8. In the S3 Prefix field, enter a prefix for the access logs.

9. Click on the Save button to save the changes.

After following these steps, the ELB access logs will be enabled and will start logging to the specified S3 bucket. You can then use these logs for troubleshooting and analysis purposes.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of ELB not having logging enabled in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to enable access logs for the ELB:

```
aws elb modify-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-name <ELB Name> --load-balancer-attributes "{\"AccessLog\":{\"Enabled\":true,\"S3BucketName\":\"<S3 Bucket Name>\",\"S3BucketPrefix\":\"<S3 Bucket Prefix>\"}}"
```

Note: Replace `<ELB Name>`, `<S3 Bucket Name>` and `<S3 Bucket Prefix>` with the appropriate values.

Step 2: Verify if the access logs are enabled for the ELB by running the following command:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancers --load-balancer-name <ELB Name> --query "LoadBalancerDescriptions[].{AccessLog:AccessLog.Enabled}"
```

This command will return the value of "AccessLog" parameter as "true" if the access logs are enabled for the ELB.

Step 3: Check if the logs are being written to the S3 bucket by running the following command:

```
aws s3 ls s3://<S3 Bucket Name>/<S3 Bucket Prefix>/
```

This command will list all the log files that are being written to the specified S3 bucket. If the logs are being written, then the access logs are successfully enabled for the ELB.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of ELB not having logging enabled in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the ELB logging misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to import the Boto3 library in your Python script. Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python, which allows you to interact with AWS services using Python code.

```python
import boto3
```

2. Next, you need to create a Boto3 client for the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service.

```python
elb_client = boto3.client('elbv2')
```

3. Then, you can use the `describe_load_balancers` method to get a list of all the ELBs in your AWS account.

```python
response = elb_client.describe_load_balancers()
load_balancers = response['LoadBalancers']
```

4. Once you have the list of ELBs, you can loop through each ELB and check if logging is enabled or not. You can use the `describe_load_balancer_attributes` method to get the attributes of each ELB.

```python
for lb in load_balancers:
    lb_arn = lb['LoadBalancerArn']
    response = elb_client.describe_load_balancer_attributes(LoadBalancerArn=lb_arn)
    attributes = response['Attributes']
    for attr in attributes:
        if attr['Key'] == 'access_logs.s3.enabled':
            if attr['Value'] == 'false':
                # Enable logging for the ELB
                elb_client.modify_load_balancer_attributes(
                    LoadBalancerArn=lb_arn,
                    Attributes=[
                        {
                            'Key': 'access_logs.s3.enabled',
                            'Value': 'true'
                        }
                    ]
                )
```

5. Finally, you can modify the ELB attributes using the `modify_load_balancer_attributes` method to enable logging for the ELB.

The above Python code will check if logging is enabled for each ELB in your AWS account. If logging is not enabled, it will enable logging for that ELB.
