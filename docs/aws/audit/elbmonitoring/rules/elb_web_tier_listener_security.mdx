How to implement HTTPS/SSL protocol for web-tier ELB listeners?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.
2. From the EC2 dashboard, click on "Load Balancers" in the left navigation menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Secure Listeners in Web-tier ELBs" Policy.)
3. Select the web-tier ELB for which you want to implement HTTPS/SSL protocol.
4. In the load balancer details page, go to the "Listeners" tab.
5. Click on the "Add Listener" button.
6. In the "Add Listener" dialog, select "HTTPS" as the protocol for the listener.
7. Specify the desired port for the listener, typically port 443 for HTTPS traffic.
8. In the "SSL certificate" section, select the SSL certificate that you have already uploaded to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) or IAM.
   - If you have already uploaded the SSL certificate to ACM, you can select it from the dropdown menu.  
   - If you have uploaded the SSL certificate to IAM, you can choose "Choose a certificate from ACM or IAM" and then select the appropriate certificate.
9. Configure the other listener settings as per your requirements, such as the instance protocol and instance port.
10. Click on the "Add" button to add the HTTPS listener to the ELB.
11. Optionally, you can also configure other settings for the ELB, such as health checks, security groups, and target groups.
12. After adding the HTTPS listener, you need to update your DNS settings to point the domain or subdomain to the ELB's DNS name. This allows traffic to be directed to the ELB and use the HTTPS protocol.
