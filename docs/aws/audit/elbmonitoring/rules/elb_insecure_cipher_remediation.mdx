1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

2. In the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.

3. Select the load balancer that you want to check.

4. In the bottom panel, select the "Listeners" tab.

5. In the "Cipher" column, click on the "Change" link. This will open a pop-up window with the SSL Negotiation settings.

6. In the pop-up window, check the Predefined Security Policy. If the policy includes insecure ciphers, then the ELB is misconfigured.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine. After installation, you can configure it using the command `aws configure`. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all the Load Balancers: Use the following command to list all the load balancers in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the load balancers.

3. Describe the SSL policies: For each load balancer, describe the SSL policies using the following command. Replace `policy-name` with the name of the SSL policy you want to check.

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-ssl-policies --names policy-name
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with details of the SSL policy, including the enabled SSL protocols, ciphers, and the SSL negotiation policy.

4. Check for insecure ciphers: In the JSON output, look for the `Ciphers` field. This field contains a list of all the ciphers enabled for the SSL policy. Check if any of the ciphers in this list are considered insecure. If any insecure ciphers are found, then the ELB is misconfigured.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: Before you can interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a file at ~/.aws/credentials. Inside this file, you should include your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key:

   ```bash
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check for insecure ciphers: The following script will list all the ELBs and their associated policies. It will then check each policy to see if it includes any insecure ciphers:

   ```python
   import boto3

   elb = boto3.client('elbv2')

   # Get all load balancers
   load_balancers = elb.describe_load_balancers()
   
   for lb in load_balancers['LoadBalancers']:
       # Get the policies associated with each load balancer
       policies = elb.describe_ssl_policies(
           Names=[
               lb['PolicyNames'],
           ]
       )
       for policy in policies['SslPolicies']:
           # Check if the policy includes any insecure ciphers
           for cipher in policy['Ciphers']:
               if cipher['Name'] in ['RC4', 'DES', 'MD5', 'DH', 'aNULL', 'eNULL', 'LOW', 'EXP']:
                   print(f"Insecure cipher {cipher['Name']} found in policy {policy['Name']} for load balancer {lb['LoadBalancerName']}")
   ```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using the Python command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python check_insecure_ciphers.py
   ```

This script will print out a message for each insecure cipher it finds, along with the name of the policy and load balancer where it was found.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the issue of ELBs having insecure ciphers in AWS, please follow the below steps:

1. Login to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
3. Select the Load Balancers option from the left-hand menu.
4. Choose the Load Balancer that you want to remediate.
5. Click on the Listeners tab.
6. Select the listener that you want to remediate.
7. Click on the Edit button.
8. In the Edit Listener dialog box, click on the Add button to add a new protocol.
9. Select HTTPS from the Protocol drop-down menu.
10. Select the SSL certificate from the SSL certificate drop-down menu.
11. Click on the Add button.
12. In the SSL Policy drop-down menu, select a secure SSL policy such as ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08.
13. Uncheck the insecure ciphers such as RC4 and SSLv3.
14. Click on the Save button to save the changes.

Once the above steps are completed, the ELB will no longer have insecure ciphers and will be more secure.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "ELBs Should Not Have Insecure Ciphers" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the insecure ciphers being used by the ELB. You can use the following command to get a list of ciphers being used by your ELB:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancers --load-balancer-name <ELB_NAME> --query 'LoadBalancerDescriptions[].ListenerDescriptions[].Listener.Ciphers'
```

2. Once you have identified the insecure ciphers, you need to update the security policy of the ELB to disable these ciphers. You can use the following command to update the security policy of the ELB:

```
aws elb set-load-balancer-policies-for-backend-server --load-balancer-name <ELB_NAME> --policy-names <POLICY_NAME>
```

Replace `<ELB_NAME>` with the name of your ELB and `<POLICY_NAME>` with the name of the security policy that you want to apply. You can find a list of available security policies in the AWS documentation.

3. After updating the security policy, you should verify that the insecure ciphers have been disabled. You can use the same command as in step 1 to check the ciphers being used by the ELB.

4. Finally, you should test your ELB to ensure that it is still functioning as expected after disabling the insecure ciphers.

Note: It is recommended to take a backup of the ELB configuration before making any changes.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of ELBs having insecure ciphers in AWS using python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to identify the ELBs that have insecure ciphers. You can do this by using the AWS CLI command:

   ```
   aws elb describe-load-balancers --query "LoadBalancerDescriptions[?ListenerDescriptions[].PolicyNames != '[]'].{LoadBalancerName:LoadBalancerName,PolicyNames:ListenerDescriptions[].PolicyNames}" --output table
   ```

   This command will list all the ELBs that have policies attached to their listeners.

2. Once you have identified the ELBs with insecure ciphers, you can use the AWS CLI command to list the policies attached to each listener:

   ```
   aws elb describe-load-balancer-policies --load-balancer-name <ELB_Name> --query "PolicyDescriptions[].{PolicyName:PolicyName,PolicyTypeName:PolicyTypeName,Attributes:PolicyAttributeDescriptions[].{AttributeName:AttributeName,AttributeValue:AttributeValue}}" --output table
   ```

   This command will list the policies attached to the specified ELB.

3. You can then use the AWS CLI command to delete the policies that have insecure ciphers:

   ```
   aws elb delete-load-balancer-policy --load-balancer-name <ELB_Name> --policy-name <Policy_Name>
   ```

   This command will delete the specified policy from the ELB.

4. Finally, you can use the AWS CLI command to update the listeners of the ELB to use secure ciphers:

   ```
   aws elb create-load-balancer-policy --load-balancer-name <ELB_Name> --policy-name <Policy_Name> --policy-type-name SSLNegotiationPolicyType --policy-attributes AttributeName=Protocol-TLSv1.2,AttributeValue=true AttributeName=CipherOrder,AttributeValue=server-defined
   ```

   This command will create a new policy for the ELB that uses secure ciphers.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all the ELBs with insecure ciphers to remediate the issue.

Note: You can also use AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to perform these actions programmatically.
