### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.

3. Select the load balancer that you want to check.

4. In the bottom panel, select the "Listeners" tab.

5. Check the rules for each listener. If there is a rule that allows invalid HTTP headers, then the ELB is misconfigured. AWS ELB does not provide a direct option to drop invalid HTTP headers. However, you can use AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to create a rule to block or allow requests based on the HTTP headers. If such a rule is not present, then it is a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) configurations.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the available load balancers using the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with the details of all the load balancers.

3. To check the attributes of a specific load balancer, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <load-balancer-arn>
   ```

   Replace `<load-balancer-arn>` with the ARN of the load balancer you want to check. This command will return a JSON output with the attributes of the specified load balancer.

4. In the JSON output, look for the attribute `drop_invalid_header_fields_enabled`. If the value of this attribute is `false`, it means that the ELB is not configured to drop invalid HTTP headers. If the value is `true`, it means that the ELB is correctly configured to drop invalid HTTP headers.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing your Python script, you need to install the necessary libraries. You will need the boto3 library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. You can configure it in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   Then input your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

3. Write the Python script: Now you can write a Python script that uses boto3 to check if ELBs are configured to drop invalid HTTP headers. Here's a simple script that lists all your ELBs and checks their configuration:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_elb_drop_invalid_header():
       client = boto3.client('elbv2')
       elbs = client.describe_load_balancers()
       for elb in elbs['LoadBalancers']:
           attrs = client.describe_load_balancer_attributes(LoadBalancerArn=elb['LoadBalancerArn'])
           for attr in attrs['Attributes']:
               if attr['Key'] == 'routing.http.drop_invalid_header_fields.enabled':
                   print(f"ELB {elb['LoadBalancerName']} drop invalid header: {attr['Value']}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_elb_drop_invalid_header()
   ```

   This script will print the name of each ELB and whether it is configured to drop invalid HTTP headers.

4. Run the Python script: Finally, you can run your Python script using the Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python check_elb.py
   ```

   This will print out the name of each ELB and whether it is configured to drop invalid HTTP headers. If the value is 'false', then the ELB is not configured to drop invalid HTTP headers, which is a misconfiguration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "ELBs Should Drop Invalid HTTP Header" in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.

2. Click on "Load Balancers" in the left-hand menu.

3. Select the ELB for which you want to remediate this misconfiguration.

4. Click on the "Listeners" tab in the bottom pane.

5. Identify the listener that is using an invalid HTTP header and click on the "Edit" button for that listener.

6. Scroll down to the "HTTP Headers" section and click on the "Add" button.

7. In the "Name" field, enter the name of the invalid HTTP header that you want to drop.

8. In the "Value" field, enter the value of the invalid HTTP header that you want to drop.

9. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

10. Repeat steps 5-9 for any other listeners that are using invalid HTTP headers.

11. Once you have remediated all the invalid HTTP headers, click on the "Save" button to save the changes to the ELB.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "ELBs Should Drop Invalid HTTP Header" in AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "ELBs Should Drop Invalid HTTP Header" misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to list all the load balancers in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
   ```

2. Identify the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the load balancer that you want to remediate.

3. Run the following command to update the load balancer attributes and drop invalid HTTP headers:

   ```
   aws elbv2 modify-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <load_balancer_arn> --attributes Key=http2.dropped_headers,Value=HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR
   ```

   Note: Replace `<load_balancer_arn>` with the ARN of the load balancer identified in step 2.

4. Verify that the invalid HTTP headers are dropped by running the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <load_balancer_arn>
   ```

   Note: Replace `<load_balancer_arn>` with the ARN of the load balancer identified in step 2.

   This command will return the load balancer attributes, including the dropped HTTP headers.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the "ELBs Should Drop Invalid HTTP Header" misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "ELBs Should Drop Invalid HTTP Header" for AWS using python, follow these steps:

1. Import the boto3 library to interact with AWS services using python.

   ```python
   import boto3
   ```

2. Create a boto3 client for the Elastic Load Balancing service.

   ```python
   elb_client = boto3.client('elbv2')
   ```

3. Get a list of all the load balancers in your AWS account.

   ```python
   response = elb_client.describe_load_balancers()
   load_balancers = response['LoadBalancers']
   ```

4. For each load balancer, check if the "http.headers" attribute is set to "drop.invalid.header.fields". If it is not, update the attribute to "drop.invalid.header.fields".

   ```python
   for lb in load_balancers:
       lb_arn = lb['LoadBalancerArn']
       lb_attributes = elb_client.describe_load_balancer_attributes(LoadBalancerArn=lb_arn)
       lb_http_headers = lb_attributes['Attributes'][0]
       if lb_http_headers['Key'] == 'http.headers':
           if lb_http_headers['Value'] != 'drop.invalid.header.fields':
               elb_client.modify_load_balancer_attributes(
                   LoadBalancerArn=lb_arn,
                   Attributes=[
                       {
                           'Key': 'http.headers',
                           'Value': 'drop.invalid.header.fields'
                       }
                   ]
               )
   ```

5. Once the "http.headers" attribute is updated for all the load balancers, the misconfiguration "ELBs Should Drop Invalid HTTP Header" will be remediated.

   ```python
   print("Misconfiguration remediated successfully!")
   ```

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to modify the attributes of the load balancers in your AWS account.
