How to determine the load balancer type currently used by your HTTP or HTTPS applications?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.
2. From the EC2 dashboard, click on "Load Balancers" in the left navigation menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "ALBs Should Not Have Insecure Configurations" Policy.)
3. You will see a list of load balancers in your account. Look for the load balancer(s) associated with your HTTP/HTTPS applications.
4. Select the load balancer that you want to determine the type of.
5. In the load balancer details page, you will find information about the load balancer, including its type.
   - If the load balancer type is "Application Load Balancer," it indicates that you are using an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for your HTTP/HTTPS applications.  
   - If the load balancer type is "Classic Load Balancer," it indicates that you are using a Classic Load Balancer (CLB) for your HTTP/HTTPS applications.  
   - If the load balancer type is "Network Load Balancer," it indicates that you are using a Network Load Balancer (NLB) for your HTTP/HTTPS applications.
