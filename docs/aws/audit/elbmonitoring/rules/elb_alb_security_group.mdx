Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the "ALBs Should Not Have Insecure Configurations" misconfiguration in AWS:

1. Log in to your AWS console.

2. Navigate to the AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) that has an insecure configuration.

3. Click on the "Listeners" tab.

4. Review the current listener configuration to ensure that it uses secure protocols such as HTTPS.

5. If the current listener configuration is insecure, click on the "Edit" button.

6. Update the listener configuration to use secure protocols such as HTTPS.

7. Click on the "Save" button to save the updated configuration.

8. Navigate to the "Security" tab.

9. Review the current security configuration to ensure that it meets your security requirements.

10. If the current security configuration is insecure, click on the "Edit" button.

11. Update the security configuration to meet your security requirements.

12. Click on the "Save" button to save the updated configuration.

13. Verify that the ALB now has a secure configuration.

14. If the ALB still has an insecure configuration, review the AWS documentation or seek assistance from AWS support to resolve the issue.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "ALBs Should Not Have Insecure Configurations" misconfiguration in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the insecure configurations of ALBs in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the ALBs in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
   ```

3. Identify the ALB with insecure configurations.

4. Run the following command to modify the security policy of the identified ALB:

   ```
   aws elbv2 modify-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <ALB_ARN> --attributes Key=security.groups.enabled,Value=true
   ```

   Replace `<ALB_ARN>` with the ARN of the identified ALB.

5. Run the following command to verify that the security policy has been modified:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <ALB_ARN>
   ```

   Replace `<ALB_ARN>` with the ARN of the identified ALB.

6. Verify that the security policy has been modified successfully.

By following these steps, you can remediate the insecure configurations of ALBs in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the insecure configuration of Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using pip:

```
pip install boto3
```

Step 2: Create a Boto3 client for Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service:

```python
import boto3

elbv2_client = boto3.client('elbv2')
```

Step 3: Get a list of all the ALBs in your AWS account:

```python
response = elbv2_client.describe_load_balancers()
alb_list = response['LoadBalancers']
```

Step 4: For each ALB in the list, check if it has any insecure configuration and remediate it:

```python
for alb in alb_list:
    # Check if the ALB has any insecure configuration
    if alb['Scheme'] != 'internet-facing':
        # If the ALB is not internet-facing, modify its scheme to internet-facing
        response = elbv2_client.modify_load_balancer_attributes(
            LoadBalancerArn=alb['LoadBalancerArn'],
            Attributes=[
                {
                    'Key': 'scheme',
                    'Value': 'internet-facing'
                }
            ]
        )
```

Step 5: Verify that the insecure configuration has been remediated by checking the scheme of the ALB:

```python
response = elbv2_client.describe_load_balancers(
    LoadBalancerArns=[
        alb['LoadBalancerArn']
    ]
)
alb_scheme = response['LoadBalancers'][0]['Scheme']
print(f"ALB {alb['LoadBalancerArn']} scheme: {alb_scheme}")
```

Note: This is just an example of how to remediate insecure configurations of ALBs in AWS using Python. Depending on the specific misconfiguration, the remediation steps may vary.
