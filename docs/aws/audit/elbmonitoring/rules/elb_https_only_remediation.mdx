### Remediation

How to determine if your load balancers are only using secure listeners?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.
2. Click on "Load Balancers" in the navigation panel on the left side.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "ELB Should Accept HTTPS Connections Only" Policy.)
3. Select the ELB (Classic Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer) for which you want to configure secure listeners.
4. In the load balancer details page, click on the "Listeners" tab.
5. Review the existing listeners configured for the ELB. Note any insecure or non-secure protocols (such as HTTP).
6. To enforce secure listeners, you have two options depending on your load balancer type:
   a. Classic Load Balancer:
      - Click on the "Edit" button next to the listener you want to secure.
      - Change the protocol to use secure options like HTTPS or SSL.
      - Provide the necessary information for the SSL certificate (e.g., upload a new certificate or select an existing one).
      - Click on the "Save" button to update the listener.
      - Repeat these steps for each insecure listener that needs to be secured.
   b. Application Load Balancer:
      - Click on the "View/edit rules" button next to the listener you want to secure.
      - In the rules editor, select the rule that corresponds to the insecure listener.
      - Modify the rule to use a secure protocol (HTTPS) and specify the necessary SSL certificate.
      - Click on the "Save" button to update the rule.
      - Repeat these steps for each insecure listener that needs to be secured.
7. After securing all the listeners, review the updated configuration to ensure that only secure protocols (such as HTTPS) are being used.
8. Test the ELB to verify that the secure listeners are functioning correctly.
