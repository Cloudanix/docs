How to determine if your load balancers are only using secure listeners?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the navigation panel, under LOAD BALANCING, click Load Balancers. Select the Elastic Load Balancer that you want to examine.

- Step 2: Select the Listeners tab from the bottom panel and click the Edit button under the available listener(s). In the Edit listeners dialog box, click Add to add a new entry.

- Step 3: In the Load Balancer Protocol dropdown list, select HTTPS (Secure HTTP).

- Step 4: Under the Cipher column, click Change and make sure the latest Predefined Security Policy is selected. If you need to use a custom policy, select Custom Security Policy and configure your own policy. If you apply any changes in this section click Save, otherwise click Cancel to return to the Edit listeners dialog box.

- Step 5: Under the SSL Certificate column, click Change and select one of the following options:
  A: Choose an existing certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) - to use an existing SSL certificate purchased via AWS Certificate Manager. If you haven’t purchased any SSL certificates you can click Request a new ACM certificate link and AWS will redirect your request to the ACM dashboard where you can buy the certificate.

  B: Choose an existing certificate from AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) - to use an existing SSL certificate uploaded previously to AWS IAM through the ELB dashboard. Select the certificate name from the Certificate dropdown list:

  C: Upload a new SSL certificate to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) - deploy an SSL certificate purchased by entering the required information: granted by the SSL provider from which you bought the certificate.

- Step 6: Click Save to apply the selected SSL certificate. Back to the Edit listeners dialog box, review the listeners configuration and click Save. If successful, the following message will be displayed: “Finished updating listeners. Your listeners have been successfully updated.”.

- Step 7: Click Close. The configuration should update and list the new HTTPS listener.
