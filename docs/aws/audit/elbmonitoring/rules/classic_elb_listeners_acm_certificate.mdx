### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.

3. Select the Classic Load Balancer you want to inspect.

4. In the bottom panel, select the "Listeners" tab. This tab displays the protocols and ports configured for your load balancer, as well as any assigned SSL certificates.

5. Check if there is at least one ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) certificate associated with the listener. If there is no ACM certificate, or if the certificate is not from ACM, then the Classic ELB is misconfigured.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the Classic Load Balancers in your account using the following command:

   ```
   aws elb describe-load-balancers
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the Classic Load Balancers.

3. To check the listeners for each Load Balancer, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws elb describe-load-balancer-policies --load-balancer-name <your-load-balancer-name>
   ```

   Replace `<your-load-balancer-name>` with the name of your Load Balancer. This command will return a JSON output with details of all the policies attached to the Load Balancer.

4. To check if there is at least one ACM certificate attached to the listeners, you need to parse the JSON output from the previous command. Look for the "PolicyDescriptions" field in the output. If there is an ACM certificate attached, it will be listed under the "PolicyAttributeDescriptions" field with the attribute name as "SSLCertificateId" and the value as the ARN of the ACM certificate. If there is no such field, it means there is no ACM certificate attached to the listeners.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   First, you need to install Boto3. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3`. After installing Boto3, you need to configure it. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. Import necessary libraries and establish a client connection:
   In your Python script, you need to import the Boto3 library and establish a client connection to AWS. Here is an example:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a low-level service client by name using the default session.
   elb = boto3.client('elbv2')
   acm = boto3.client('acm')
   ```

3. Retrieve all the load balancers and their listeners:
   You can use the `describe_load_balancers` and `describe_listeners` methods to retrieve all the load balancers and their listeners. Here is an example:

   ```python
   # Retrieve all the load balancers
   load_balancers = elb.describe_load_balancers()

   for load_balancer in load_balancers['LoadBalancers']:
       # Retrieve the listeners for each load balancer
       listeners = elb.describe_listeners(LoadBalancerArn=load_balancer['LoadBalancerArn'])
   ```

4. Check if the listeners have at least one ACM certificate:
   You can use the `describe_certificate` method to check if the listeners have at least one ACM certificate. Here is an example:

   ```python
   for listener in listeners['Listeners']:
       if 'Certificates' in listener:
           for certificate in listener['Certificates']:
               if certificate['IsDefault'] == True:
                   acm_certificate = acm.describe_certificate(CertificateArn=certificate['CertificateArn'])
                   if 'Certificate' in acm_certificate:
                       print(f"Listener {listener['ListenerArn']} has an ACM certificate.")
                   else:
                       print(f"Listener {listener['ListenerArn']} does not have an ACM certificate.")
       else:
           print(f"Listener {listener['ListenerArn']} does not have any certificates.")
   ```
   This script will print out whether each listener has an ACM certificate or not.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Classic ELB Listeners not having at least one ACM certificate in AWS, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. Navigate to the AWS Management Console and go to the EC2 dashboard.

2. In the navigation pane, under the 'Load Balancing' section, click on 'Load Balancers'.

3. Select the Classic Load Balancer that needs to be remediated.

4. Under the 'Listeners' tab, identify the listener that does not have an ACM certificate attached.

5. Click on the 'Edit' button next to the listener that needs to be remediated.

6. In the 'Edit Listener' configuration, select the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) for the listener.

7. For HTTPS protocol, select 'HTTPS' from the drop-down menu and choose the appropriate port.

8. In the 'SSL certificate' drop-down menu, select 'Choose a certificate from ACM (recommended)'.

9. Select the ACM certificate that you want to attach to this listener from the list of available certificates.

10. Click on the 'Save' button to apply the changes.

11. Verify that the ACM certificate is now attached to the listener by checking the 'Listeners' tab for the Classic Load Balancer.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of Classic ELB Listeners not having at least one ACM certificate in AWS Elastic Load Balancer using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of classic ELB listeners not having at least one ACM certificate in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. List all your classic ELBs to identify the affected ones:
```bash
aws elb describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancerDescriptions[?Scheme==`internet-facing`].[LoadBalancerName]' --output text
```

2. For each affected classic ELB, update the listener to attach an ACM certificate:
```bash
aws elb set-load-balancer-listener-ssl-certificate --load-balancer-name YOUR_LOAD_BALANCER_NAME --load-balancer-port LISTENER_PORT --ssl-certificate-id YOUR_ACM_CERTIFICATE_ARN
```
Replace the placeholders:
- `YOUR_LOAD_BALANCER_NAME` with the name of your ELB.
- `LISTENER_PORT` with the port number of the listener you want to update.
- `YOUR_ACM_CERTIFICATE_ARN` with the ARN of the ACM certificate you want to attach.

3. Verify that the ACM certificate has been successfully attached to the listener:
```bash
aws elb describe-load-balancers --load-balancer-name YOUR_LOAD_BALANCER_NAME --query 'LoadBalancerDescriptions[].ListenerDescriptions[?Listener.LoadBalancerPort==`LISTENER_PORT`].Listener.SSLCertificateId' --output text
```

Repeat these steps for each affected classic ELB to ensure that all listeners have at least one ACM certificate attached.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of having at least one ACM certificate for Classic ELB listeners in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary Python libraries:
   Make sure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Write a Python script to check and update the ACM certificate for the Classic ELB listeners:
   Here is a sample Python script that you can use to check and update the ACM certificate for Classic ELB listeners:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize the ELB and ACM clients
   elb_client = boto3.client('elb')
   acm_client = boto3.client('acm')

   # Specify the Classic ELB name
   elb_name = 'YOUR_CLASSIC_ELB_NAME'

   # Get the list of listeners for the Classic ELB
   response = elb_client.describe_load_balancers(LoadBalancerNames=[elb_name])
   listeners = response['LoadBalancerDescriptions'][0]['ListenerDescriptions']

   # Check if any listener is missing an ACM certificate
   for listener in listeners:
       if listener['Listener'].get('SSLCertificateId') is None:
           # Get a valid ACM certificate ARN
           response = acm_client.list_certificates()
           acm_certificate_arn = response['CertificateSummaryList'][0]['CertificateArn']

           # Update the listener with the ACM certificate
           elb_client.set_load_balancer_listener_ssl_certificate(
               LoadBalancerName=elb_name,
               LoadBalancerPort=listener['Listener']['LoadBalancerPort'],
               SSLCertificateId=acm_certificate_arn
           )
           print(f"Updated ACM certificate for listener on port {listener['Listener']['LoadBalancerPort']}")

   ```

3. Modify the script with your Classic ELB name:
   Replace `'YOUR_CLASSIC_ELB_NAME'` with the name of your Classic ELB.

4. Run the Python script:
   Save the script to a file (e.g., `remediate_acm_cert.py`) and run it using Python:
   ```
   python remediate_acm_cert.py
   ```

5. Verify the ACM certificate update:
   Once the script has run successfully, verify that each listener on the Classic ELB now has an ACM certificate attached.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having at least one ACM certificate for Classic ELB listeners in AWS using Python.
