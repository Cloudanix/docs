<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) from having Cross-Zone Load Balancing disabled using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Load Balancer:**
   First, list all your load balancers to identify the one you want to configure.

   ```sh
   aws elb describe-load-balancers
   ```

2. **Check Current Cross-Zone Load Balancing Setting:**
   Verify the current cross-zone load balancing setting for your load balancer.

   ```sh
   aws elb describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-name <your-load-balancer-name>
   ```

3. **Enable Cross-Zone Load Balancing:**
   Enable cross-zone load balancing for the identified load balancer.

   ```sh
   aws elb modify-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-name <your-load-balancer-name> --load-balancer-attributes "{\"CrossZoneLoadBalancing\":{\"Enabled\":true}}"
   ```

4. **Verify the Change:**
   Confirm that cross-zone load balancing has been enabled.

   ```sh
   aws elb describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-name <your-load-balancer-name>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that cross-zone load balancing is enabled for your Elastic Load Balancers using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) from being created without cross-zone load balancing enabled in AWS using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Boto3 Library**:
   Ensure you have the Boto3 library installed. If not, you can install it using pip.
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create a Boto3 Session**:
   Initialize a Boto3 session with your AWS credentials and region.

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='YOUR_AWS_REGION'
   )
   ```

3. **Create ELB Client**:
   Create an ELB client using the session.

   ```python
   elb_client = session.client('elb')
   ```

4. **Create ELB with Cross-Zone Load Balancing Enabled**:
   When creating an ELB, ensure that the `CrossZoneLoadBalancing` attribute is set to `True`.

   ```python
   response = elb_client.create_load_balancer(
       LoadBalancerName='my-load-balancer',
       Listeners=[
           {
               'Protocol': 'HTTP',
               'LoadBalancerPort': 80,
               'InstanceProtocol': 'HTTP',
               'InstancePort': 80,
           },
       ],
       AvailabilityZones=[
           'us-west-2a',
           'us-west-2b',
       ],
       Tags=[
           {
               'Key': 'Name',
               'Value': 'my-load-balancer'
           },
       ]
   )

   # Enable cross-zone load balancing
   elb_client.modify_load_balancer_attributes(
       LoadBalancerName='my-load-balancer',
       LoadBalancerAttributes={
           'CrossZoneLoadBalancing': {
               'Enabled': True
           }
       }
   )

   print("ELB created with cross-zone load balancing enabled.")
   ```

By following these steps, you ensure that any ELB created using this script will have cross-zone load balancing enabled, thus preventing the misconfiguration.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.

3. Select the load balancer that you want to check.

4. In the bottom panel, select the "Attributes" tab.

5. Under "Cross-Zone Load Balancing", check the status. If it's set to "Disabled", then the ELB does not have Cross Zone enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```

   During the configuration process, you will be asked to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all the Load Balancers: Once your AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the Elastic Load Balancers in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object containing details about all the Load Balancers in your account.

3. Check Cross Zone Load Balancing: For each Load Balancer, you need to check if the Cross Zone Load Balancing is enabled or not. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <Load_Balancer_Arn>
   ```

   Replace `<Load_Balancer_Arn>` with the ARN of the Load Balancer you want to check. This command will return a JSON object containing the attributes of the Load Balancer.

4. Parse the output: The output of the above command will contain a field named `cross_zone_load_balancing.enabled`. If this field is set to `false`, it means that Cross Zone Load Balancing is not enabled for the Load Balancer. If it is set to `true`, it means that Cross Zone Load Balancing is enabled. You can parse the output using a tool like `jq` or a scripting language like Python to automate the process.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The Boto3 library is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. These can be configured in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI. Run `aws configure` and then enter your credentials at the prompts.

3. Write the Python script: The following Python script uses Boto3 to check if Cross Zone Load Balancing is enabled for all Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in a region.

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_cross_zone_load_balancing():
       elb = boto3.client('elbv2')
       elbs = elb.describe_load_balancers()
       for elb in elbs['LoadBalancers']:
           attributes = elb.describe_load_balancer_attributes(LoadBalancerArn=elb['LoadBalancerArn'])
           for attr in attributes['Attributes']:
               if attr['Key'] == 'load_balancing.cross_zone.enabled':
                   print(f"ELB {elb['LoadBalancerName']} Cross Zone Load Balancing: {attr['Value']}")

   check_cross_zone_load_balancing()
   ```
   This script will print the name of each ELB and whether or not Cross Zone Load Balancing is enabled.

4. Run the script: Save the script to a file, then run it with Python. The script will print out the status of Cross Zone Load Balancing for each ELB in the region. If Cross Zone Load Balancing is not enabled for an ELB, it will print 'false'. If it is enabled, it will print 'true'. 

   ```bash
   python check_elb_cross_zone.py
   ```
   
Please note that this script only checks ELBs in the default region. If you have ELBs in other regions, you will need to modify the script to check those regions as well.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "ELBs should have cross-zone enabled" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to enable cross-zone load balancing for all existing ELBs in the current region:
```
aws elb modify-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-name <ELB_NAME> --load-balancer-attributes "{\"CrossZoneLoadBalancing\":{\"Enabled\":true}}"
```
Replace `<ELB_NAME>` with the name of the ELB that needs to be remediated.

3. Run the following command to enable cross-zone load balancing for all new ELBs created in the current region:
```
aws elb create-lb-cookie-stickiness-policy --load-balancer-name <ELB_NAME> --policy-name "cross-zone-policy" --cookie-expiration-period 60
```
Replace `<ELB_NAME>` with the name of the ELB that needs to be remediated.

4. Verify that cross-zone load balancing is enabled for the ELB by running the following command:
```
aws elb describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-name <ELB_NAME> --query 'LoadBalancerAttributes.CrossZoneLoadBalancing.Enabled'
```
Replace `<ELB_NAME>` with the name of the ELB that was remediated.

5. Repeat these steps for all ELBs in the current region that require remediation.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of ELBs not having cross-zone enabled in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Create an AWS client for Elastic Load Balancing:
```python
elb_client = boto3.client('elbv2')
```

3. Get the list of all the ELBs:
```python
elbs = elb_client.describe_load_balancers()
```

4. Loop through each ELB and check if cross-zone load balancing is enabled. If not, enable it:
```python
for elb in elbs['LoadBalancers']:
    elb_arn = elb['LoadBalancerArn']
    elb_attributes = elb_client.describe_load_balancer_attributes(LoadBalancerArn=elb_arn)
    if not elb_attributes['Attributes'][0]['Value']:
        elb_client.modify_load_balancer_attributes(
            LoadBalancerArn=elb_arn,
            Attributes=[
                {
                    'Key': 'load_balancing.cross_zone.enabled',
                    'Value': 'true'
                }
            ]
        )
```

5. Verify that cross-zone load balancing is enabled for all the ELBs:
```python
for elb in elbs['LoadBalancers']:
    elb_arn = elb['LoadBalancerArn']
    elb_attributes = elb_client.describe_load_balancer_attributes(LoadBalancerArn=elb_arn)
    if not elb_attributes['Attributes'][0]['Value']:
        print(f"{elb['LoadBalancerName']} - Cross-Zone Load Balancing is not Enabled")
    else:
        print(f"{elb['LoadBalancerName']} - Cross-Zone Load Balancing is Enabled")
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of ELBs not having cross-zone enabled in AWS using Python.
