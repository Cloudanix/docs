### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under "Load Balancing", click on "Load Balancers".
3. In the Load Balancers page, you will see a list of all your load balancers. Click on the load balancer you want to check.
4. In the Description tab, under Basic Configuration, check the Scheme. If it is "internet-facing", it means the load balancer is exposed to the internet.

#### Using CLI

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. **List all Load Balancers**: The first step to detect internet-facing ELBs is to list all the load balancers in your account. You can do this by running the following command: `aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers`. This command will return a JSON object containing details about all the load balancers in your account.

3. **Filter Internet-facing Load Balancers**: The next step is to filter out the internet-facing load balancers from the list. You can do this by looking at the `Scheme` attribute of each load balancer. If the `Scheme` is `internet-facing`, then the load balancer is exposed to the internet. You can use the following command to filter out the internet-facing load balancers: 

```bash
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancers[?Scheme==`internet-facing`]'
```

4. **Review the Security Groups**: The final step is to review the security groups associated with each internet-facing load balancer. You can do this by looking at the `SecurityGroups` attribute of each load balancer. You can use the following command to list the security groups associated with each internet-facing load balancer:

```bash
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancers[?Scheme==`internet-facing`].SecurityGroups'
```

This will return a list of security group IDs. You can then use the `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>` command to review the rules for each security group.

#### Using Python

1. Install Boto3: Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. You can configure it in several ways, but the simplest way is to fill the ~/.aws/credentials file:

```python
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

3. Use Boto3 to List All ELBs: You can use the Boto3 library to list all the Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in your account. Here is a simple script that does this:

```python
import boto3

def list_elbs():
    client = boto3.client('elbv2')
    response = client.describe_load_balancers()
    return response['LoadBalancers']

elbs = list_elbs()
for elb in elbs:
    print(elb['LoadBalancerName'])
```

4. Check If ELBs are Internet-facing: Once you have the list of all ELBs, you can check if they are internet-facing by checking the 'Scheme' attribute of each ELB. If the 'Scheme' attribute is 'internet-facing', then the ELB is internet-facing. Here is how you can do this:

```python
def check_if_internet_facing(elbs):
    internet_facing_elbs = []
    for elb in elbs:
        if elb['Scheme'] == 'internet-facing':
            internet_facing_elbs.append(elb['LoadBalancerName'])
    return internet_facing_elbs

internet_facing_elbs = check_if_internet_facing(elbs)
for elb in internet_facing_elbs:
    print(elb)
```

This script will print the names of all internet-facing ELBs in your AWS account.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

The following are the step by step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "Internet Facing ELBs Should Be Regularly Reviewed" in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 service.
3. Click on the "Load Balancers" option in the left-hand menu.
4. Select the Internet-facing ELB that needs to be reviewed.
5. Click on the "Listeners" tab.
6. Review the protocol and port configuration for each listener. Ensure that they are configured according to your organization's security policies.
7. Click on the "Security" tab.
8. Review the security groups associated with the ELB. Ensure that only necessary ports are open and that the source IP ranges are restricted to only authorized IPs.
9. Click on the "Instances" tab.
10. Review the instances associated with the ELB. Ensure that they are running the latest security patches and that they are not exposing any unnecessary services.
11. Click on the "Health Check" tab.
12. Review the health check configuration. Ensure that it is configured according to your organization's security policies.
13. Click on the "Attributes" tab.
14. Review the attributes associated with the ELB. Ensure that they are configured according to your organization's security policies.
15. Make any necessary changes to the ELB configuration.
16. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

By following the above steps, the misconfiguration "Internet Facing ELBs Should Be Regularly Reviewed" can be remediated in AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to list all the internet-facing Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in your account:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query "LoadBalancers[?Scheme=='internet-facing'].LoadBalancerArn" --output text
   ```

2. Review the output and identify any ELBs that are no longer needed or should not be internet-facing.

3. For each internet-facing ELB that needs to be reviewed, run the following command to modify the scheme to internal:

   ```
   aws elbv2 modify-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <ELB_ARN> --attributes Key=scheme,Value=internal
   ```

   Replace `<ELB_ARN>` with the ARN of the ELB that needs to be modified.

4. Verify that the ELB's scheme has been changed to internal by running the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --load-balancer-arns <ELB_ARN> --query "LoadBalancers[0].Scheme" --output text
   ```

   Replace `<ELB_ARN>` with the ARN of the ELB that was modified.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for each internet-facing ELB that needs to be reviewed.

6. Once all internet-facing ELBs have been reviewed and modified, run the first command again to verify that all internet-facing ELBs have been remediated.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Internet Facing ELBs in AWS, you can use the following Python script:

```
import boto3

# Create a boto3 client for ELB
elb_client = boto3.client('elbv2')

# Define the ELB ARN
elb_arn = 'arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-load-balancer/50dc6c495c0c9188'

# Set the desired security group ID
security_group_id = 'sg-1234567890abcdef'

# Update the ELB security group
response = elb_client.set_security_groups(
    LoadBalancerArn=elb_arn,
    SecurityGroups=[
        security_group_id,
    ]
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

This script uses the boto3 library to create a client for Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) in AWS. It then sets the desired security group ID for the specified ELB ARN using the `set_security_groups` function. Finally, it prints the response from the API call.

To use this script, replace the `elb_arn` and `security_group_id` values with the appropriate values for your environment. You can then run the script to remediate the misconfiguration of Internet Facing ELBs in AWS.
