<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To ensure that the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations is used for web-tier Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS CLI:

1. **Identify the ELB Name:**
   First, identify the name of the ELB for which you want to update the SSL policy. You can list all your ELBs using the following command:
   ```sh
   aws elb describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancerDescriptions[*].LoadBalancerName'
   ```

2. **Describe the Current SSL Policies:**
   Check the current SSL policies associated with your ELB to understand what is currently in use. Use the following command:
   ```sh
   aws elb describe-load-balancer-policies --load-balancer-name <your-elb-name>
   ```

3. **Set the Latest SSL Policy:**
   AWS provides predefined security policies that you can use. To set the latest predefined security policy (e.g., `ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08`), use the following command:
   ```sh
   aws elb set-load-balancer-policies-of-listener --load-balancer-name <your-elb-name> --load-balancer-port 443 --policy-names ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08
   ```

4. **Verify the Update:**
   Finally, verify that the SSL policy has been updated correctly by describing the load balancer policies again:
   ```sh
   aws elb describe-load-balancer-policies --load-balancer-name <your-elb-name>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your web-tier ELBs are using the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of not using the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations in Web-Tier Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs), you can use the AWS SDK for Python, known as Boto3. Below are the steps to ensure that the latest security policy is applied to your ELBs:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by directly configuring them in your script.

3. **Python Script to Update SSL Policy**:
   Use the following Python script to update the SSL policy of your ELBs to the latest recommended policy (e.g., `ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08`):

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon ELB
   client = boto3.client('elb')

   # List all load balancers
   response = client.describe_load_balancers()

   # Iterate through each load balancer
   for lb in response['LoadBalancerDescriptions']:
       lb_name = lb['LoadBalancerName']
       print(f"Updating SSL policy for Load Balancer: {lb_name}")

       # Update the SSL negotiation policy for each listener
       for listener in lb['ListenerDescriptions']:
           if listener['Listener']['Protocol'] == 'HTTPS':
               client.set_load_balancer_policies_of_listener(
                   LoadBalancerName=lb_name,
                   LoadBalancerPort=listener['Listener']['LoadBalancerPort'],
                   PolicyNames=['ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08']
               )
               print(f"Updated listener on port {listener['Listener']['LoadBalancerPort']} to use ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08")

   print("SSL policies updated successfully.")
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script in your Python environment. This script will iterate through all your ELBs and update the SSL negotiation policy to the latest recommended policy for all HTTPS listeners.

   ```bash
   python update_ssl_policy.py
   ```

By following these steps, you ensure that your Web-Tier ELBs are using the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations, thereby enhancing the security of your load balancers.

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, click on Load Balancers.
3. Select the load balancer you want to inspect. In the bottom panel, click on the "Listeners" tab.
4. Check the SSL Certificate column. If the column is empty or the policy is not up-to-date, then the ELB is not using the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by downloading the appropriate installer from the AWS CLI website. Once installed, you can configure it by running `aws configure` and providing your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all Load Balancers: Use the following command to list all the load balancers in your account.

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object with details about all your load balancers.

3. Check the SSL Policies: For each load balancer, check the SSL policies by using the following command:

   ```
   aws elbv2 describe-ssl-policies --names [policy-name]
   ```

   Replace `[policy-name]` with the name of the SSL policy you want to check. This command will return a JSON object with details about the specified SSL policy.

4. Analyze the output: Look for the "SslProtocols" field in the output. If the policy includes outdated or insecure protocols (like SSLv3 or TLS 1.0), then the load balancer is not using the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3` in your terminal.

2. Import the necessary modules and establish a session with AWS using your credentials. Here's a basic setup:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Now, create a client for ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) and retrieve all the load balancers.

```python
elb = session.client('elbv2')
load_balancers = elb.describe_load_balancers()
```

4. Iterate over each load balancer and check the SSL policy. If the policy is not the latest, print a message.

```python
for lb in load_balancers['LoadBalancers']:
    listeners = elb.describe_listeners(LoadBalancerArn=lb['LoadBalancerArn'])
    for listener in listeners['Listeners']:
        if 'SslPolicy' in listener and listener['SslPolicy'] != 'ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08':
            print(f"Load balancer {lb['LoadBalancerName']} is using outdated SSL policy {listener['SslPolicy']}")
```

This script will print out the names of all load balancers that are using an SSL policy other than 'ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08', which is the latest policy. Please replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', and 'YOUR_REGION' with your actual AWS credentials and region.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this issue for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to get the load balancer security policy names:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancer-policies --load-balancer-name <ELB_NAME>
```

Replace `<ELB_NAME>` with the name of your load balancer.

3. Identify the security policy that is currently in use for the load balancer. The security policy should be named `ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08` or later.

4. If the load balancer is using an older security policy, run the following command to update it:

```
aws elb set-load-balancer-policies-for-backend-server --load-balancer-name <ELB_NAME> --policy-names <NEW_POLICY_NAME>
```

Replace `<ELB_NAME>` with the name of your load balancer and `<NEW_POLICY_NAME>` with the name of the latest AWS security policy. The latest security policy name can be found in the AWS documentation.

5. Verify that the new security policy is in use by running the following command:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-name <ELB_NAME>
```

Replace `<ELB_NAME>` with the name of your load balancer. The command should return a JSON object that includes the new security policy name.

6. Once you have verified that the new security policy is in use, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Latest AWS Security Policy for SSL Negotiations Should Be Used For Web-Tier ELBs" in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```
import boto3
```

2. Create a boto3 client for Elastic Load Balancing:

```
elb_client = boto3.client('elbv2')
```

3. Get a list of all the load balancers:

```
load_balancers = elb_client.describe_load_balancers()
```

4. Loop through each load balancer and check if it is a web-tier ELB:

```
for load_balancer in load_balancers['LoadBalancers']:
    if 'web' in load_balancer['LoadBalancerName']:
```

5. If the load balancer is a web-tier ELB, update its SSL policy:

```
elb_client.modify_load_balancer_attributes(
    LoadBalancerArn=load_balancer['LoadBalancerArn'],
    Attributes=[
        {
            'Key': 'ssl_policy',
            'Value': 'ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-Ext-2018-06'
        },
    ]
)
```

6. The SSL policy `ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-Ext-2018-06` is the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations. You can modify the code to use a different SSL policy if required.

7. Finally, you can add this code to a script and run it periodically to ensure that all web-tier ELBs are using the latest AWS security policy for SSL negotiations.
