How to implement HTTPS/SSL protocol for web-tier ELB listeners?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: Navigate to EC2 dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

- Step 2: In the navigation panel, under LOAD BALANCING, click Load Balancers.

- Step 3: Select the web-tier ELB that you want to reconfigure (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource).

- Step 4: Select the Listeners tab from the bottom panel and click the Edit button under the available listener(s).

- Step 5: Inside the Edit listeners dialog box, click Add to add a new entry.

- Step 6: In the Load Balancer Protocol dropdown list, select HTTPS (Secure HTTP) or SSL (Secure TCP).

- Step 7: In the Cipher column, click Change and make sure the latest Predefined Security Policy selected is ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08 (recommended). If you want to use a custom policy, select Custom Security Policy and configure your own policy. If you need to apply any changes click Save, otherwise click Cancel to return to the Edit listeners dialog box.

- Step 8: In the SSL Certificate column, click Change and select one of the following options:
  A: Choose a certificate from ACM (recommended) - to use an existing SSL certificate purchased via Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM). If you haven’t purchased yet any SSL certificates you can request one by clicking Request a new ACM certificate link and AWS will redirect your request to the ACM dashboard where you can buy the required certificate. Click Save to apply the selected certificate.

  B: Choose a certificate from IAM - to use an existing SSL certificate uploaded previously to AWS IAM service using the AWS console. Select the name of the SSL certificate that you want install from the Certificate dropdown list. Click Save to apply the changes.

  C: Upload a certificate to IAM - deploy an SSL certificate purchased from a third-party provider by entering the required information (pem encoded) within the Private Key, Certificate body and Certificate chain boxes, information granted by the SSL provider from which you bought the certificate. Make sure you type a unique name for the uploaded SSL certificate in the Certificate name box. Click Save to apply the installed SSL certificate.

- Step 9: Back to the Edit listeners dialog box, review the secure listeners configuration, then click Save. If successful, the following message will be displayed: “Finished updating listeners. Your listeners have been successfully updated.”. Click Close to return to the EC2 dashboard.

- Step 10: Repeat steps no. 4 – 10 for each web-tier ELB that needs to secure its front-end traffic, provisioned in the selected region.

- Step 11: Change the AWS region from the navigation bar and repeat steps no. 4 – 11 for other regions.
