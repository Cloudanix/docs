### More Info:

Your app-tier Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) listeners should be using the HTTPS/SSL protocol to encrypt the communication between your application clients and the load balancer.

### Risk Level

Low

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
The remediation steps for this misconfiguration in AWS using AWS console are as follows:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. Select the Load Balancers option from the left-hand menu.
3. Identify the application load balancer (ALB) or network load balancer (NLB) that is serving traffic to the application tier.
4. Click on the name of the load balancer to open its details page.
5. Click on the Listeners tab.
6. Identify the listener that is not secure and needs to be secured.
7. Click on the Edit button for that listener.
8. Change the protocol to HTTPS or TLS, depending on your application's requirements.
9. Select the SSL/TLS certificate that you want to use for securing the listener.
10. Click on the Save button to save the changes.

After following these steps, the listener for the application tier will be secured with SSL/TLS encryption.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The misconfiguration "Secure Listeners Should Be In App-tier ELBs" means that secure listeners should be configured only in the application tier Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) and not in any other ELBs. To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Identify the ELBs in your AWS account that are not in the application tier and have secure listeners configured. You can use the following AWS CLI command to list all the ELBs in your account:

```
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
```

2. From the list of ELBs, identify the ones that are not in the application tier and have secure listeners configured. 

3. Remove the secure listeners from the non-application tier ELBs using the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws elbv2 delete-listener --listener-arn <listener-arn>
```

Replace `<listener-arn>` with the ARN of the listener that you want to delete.

4. If required, create secure listeners in the application tier ELBs using the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws elbv2 create-listener --load-balancer-arn <load-balancer-arn> --protocol HTTPS --port 443 --ssl-policy ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08
```

Replace `<load-balancer-arn>` with the ARN of the application tier ELB.

5. Verify that all the secure listeners are configured only in the application tier ELBs by running the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws elbv2 describe-listeners
```

This will list all the listeners in your account. Verify that all the secure listeners are configured only in the application tier ELBs.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Secure Listeners Should Be In App-tier ELBs" in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Secure Listeners Should Be In App-tier ELBs" in AWS using python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Identify the app-tier ELBs: Identify the ELBs that are part of the application tier and store their names in a list.

```
import boto3

elb_client = boto3.client('elbv2')
app_elbs = []

response = elb_client.describe_load_balancers()
for elb in response['LoadBalancers']:
    tags = elb_client.describe_tags(ResourceArns=[elb['LoadBalancerArn']])
    for tag in tags['TagDescriptions'][0]['Tags']:
        if tag['Key'] == 'tier' and tag['Value'] == 'app':
            app_elbs.append(elb['LoadBalancerArn'])
```

2. Identify the secure listeners: Identify the listeners that are using secure protocols like HTTPS, SSL, TLS, etc. and store their names in a list.

```
secure_listeners = []

response = elb_client.describe_listeners()
for listener in response['Listeners']:
    if listener['Protocol'] in ['HTTPS', 'SSL', 'TLS']:
        secure_listeners.append(listener['ListenerArn'])
```

3. Check if secure listeners are attached to app-tier ELBs: Check if the secure listeners identified in step 2 are attached to the ELBs identified in step 1. If any secure listener is not attached to any app-tier ELB, then update its configuration and attach it to an app-tier ELB.

```
for listener in secure_listeners:
    response = elb_client.describe_listener_certificates(ListenerArn=listener)
    if response['Certificates']:
        elb_arn = response['Certificates'][0]['CertificateArn'].split('/')[1]
        if elb_arn not in app_elbs:
            elb_client.modify_listener(
                ListenerArn=listener,
                LoadBalancerArn=app_elbs[0],
                Port=443,
                Protocol='HTTPS'
            )
```

4. Verify the remediation: Verify that all secure listeners are attached to app-tier ELBs by running the code in step 2 again.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Secure Listeners Should Be In App-tier ELBs" in AWS using python.
