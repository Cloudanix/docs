How to configure NLBs to terminate TLS traffic?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of your NLB. ALBs operate at the application layer (Layer 7) and have built-in support for terminating TLS traffic.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "NLBs Should Not Have Insecure Configurations" Policy.)
2. Configure the ALB to terminate TLS by creating a listener with the desired SSL certificate, specifying the desired security policy, and configuring the appropriate target group to forward the decrypted traffic to the NLB.
3. Configure the NLB as the target for the ALB. You can set the NLB as the target by specifying the NLB's DNS name or the IP addresses of the NLB's instances in the target group associated with the ALB listener.
4. Update your DNS records or load balancer configurations to point to the ALB's DNS name or the ALB's load balancer endpoint.
