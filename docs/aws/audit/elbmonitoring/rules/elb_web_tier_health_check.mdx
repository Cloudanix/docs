<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of the right health check configurations for Web-Tier ELBs in AWS, you can follow the below steps using the AWS console:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.

2. Click on the Load Balancers option in the left-hand menu.

3. Select the Web-Tier ELB for which you want to remediate the health check configuration.

4. Click on the Listeners tab and then click on the Edit button for the HTTP/HTTPS listener.

5. In the Edit Listener dialog box, scroll down to the Health checks section.

6. In the Health check section, ensure that the following configurations are set correctly:

   - Protocol: HTTP or HTTPS, depending on the protocol used by your application.
   - Path: The URL path that the health check should use to verify the status of the application. This should be a valid path that returns a 200 OK response when the application is healthy.
   - Interval: The time interval between health checks. The default value is 30 seconds.
   - Timeout: The amount of time that the load balancer should wait for a response from the application before marking it as unhealthy. The default value is 5 seconds.
   - Unhealthy threshold: The number of consecutive failed health checks required to mark the application as unhealthy. The default value is 2.
   - Healthy threshold: The number of consecutive successful health checks required to mark the application as healthy again. The default value is 2.

7. Once you have verified and updated the health check configurations, click on the Save button to apply the changes.

8. Wait for a few minutes to allow the ELB to perform the health checks and update the status of the application instances.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of the right health check configurations for Web-Tier ELBs in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Right Health Check Configurations Should Be Used For Web-Tier ELBs" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to describe the load balancer:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancers --load-balancer-names <load_balancer_name>
```

Replace `<load_balancer_name>` with the name of your load balancer.

3. Find the listener for the web tier and note the port number.

4. Run the following command to update the health check configuration:

```
aws elb configure-health-check --load-balancer-name <load_balancer_name> --health-check Target=HTTP:<web_tier_port>/health_check.html,Interval=30,UnhealthyThreshold=2,HealthyThreshold=2,Timeout=3
```

Replace `<load_balancer_name>` with the name of your load balancer and `<web_tier_port>` with the port number noted in step 3.

5. Verify that the health check configuration was updated by running the following command:

```
aws elb describe-load-balancers --load-balancer-names <load_balancer_name>
```

Replace `<load_balancer_name>` with the name of your load balancer.

The output should show the updated health check configuration for the web tier listener.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Right Health Check Configurations Should Be Used For Web-Tier ELBs" in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDKs and modules in your Python script. You can use `boto3` module to interact with AWS services.

2. Create a `boto3` client for Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) using the following code:

   ```
   import boto3
   
   elb_client = boto3.client('elbv2')
   ```

3. Get a list of all the web-tier ELBs using the `describe_load_balancers` method of the ELB client:

   ```
   response = elb_client.describe_load_balancers(
       LoadBalancerArns=[
           'arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-load-balancer/50dc6c495c0c9188'
       ]
   )
   
   web_elbs = [lb for lb in response['LoadBalancers'] if lb['Type'] == 'application']
   ```

4. For each web-tier ELB, update the health check configuration using the `modify_target_group_attributes` method of the ELB client:

   ```
   for web_elb in web_elbs:
       target_group_arn = web_elb['TargetGroupArn']
       elb_client.modify_target_group_attributes(
           TargetGroupArn=target_group_arn,
           Attributes=[
               {
                   'Key': 'deregistration_delay.timeout_seconds',
                   'Value': '30'
               },
               {
                   'Key': 'health_check.interval_seconds',
                   'Value': '30'
               },
               {
                   'Key': 'health_check.path',
                   'Value': '/health'
               },
               {
                   'Key': 'health_check.healthy_threshold_count',
                   'Value': '2'
               },
               {
                   'Key': 'health_check.unhealthy_threshold_count',
                   'Value': '5'
               },
               {
                   'Key': 'health_check.timeout_seconds',
                   'Value': '5'
               }
           ]
       )
   ```

   This sets the health check configuration to use a 30-second interval, a 5-second timeout, and `/health` as the health check path. It also sets the healthy threshold count to 2 and the unhealthy threshold count to 5.

5. Save the Python script and run it to remediate the misconfiguration.

Note: Make sure you have the appropriate AWS credentials configured in your environment before running the script.
