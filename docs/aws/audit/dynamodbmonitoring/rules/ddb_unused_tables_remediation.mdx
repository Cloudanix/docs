### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of having unused DynamoDB tables in an AWS account, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AWS account using the console.
2. Go to the DynamoDB service.
3. In the left-hand menu, select "Tables".
4. Review the list of tables and identify any that are not in use.
5. Select the unused table by clicking on the table name.
6. In the top menu, select "Actions" and then "Delete table".
7. Confirm the deletion by entering the name of the table and clicking "Delete".

Repeat steps 5-7 for any other unused tables in your account.

It's important to note that before deleting any tables, you should make sure that they are not needed and that there is no data that needs to be saved. You should also consider any dependencies that may exist, such as if the table is being used by an application or other service.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of having unused DynamoDB tables in an AWS account using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. List all the DynamoDB tables in the AWS account using the following command:

```
aws dynamodb list-tables
```

2. Identify the unused tables from the list of tables obtained in the previous step. You can check the table's last access time to determine if it's unused.

3. Delete the unused tables using the following command:

```
aws dynamodb delete-table --table-name <table-name>
```

Replace `<table-name>` with the name of the unused table you want to delete.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all the unused tables are deleted.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having unused DynamoDB tables in an AWS account using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate this misconfiguration, you can use the boto3 library in Python to identify and delete any unused DynamoDB tables in your AWS account. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Install the boto3 library using pip:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Create an AWS session using boto3:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='your_access_key_id',
    aws_secret_access_key='your_secret_access_key',
    region_name='your_aws_region'
)
```

Replace the `aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`, and `region_name` with your own AWS credentials and region.

3. Use the `list_tables` method of the DynamoDB client to get a list of all the tables in your account:

```python
dynamodb = session.client('dynamodb')
response = dynamodb.list_tables()
tables = response['TableNames']
```

4. Iterate through the list of tables and use the `describe_table` method to check if each table is being used:

```python
for table_name in tables:
    response = dynamodb.describe_table(TableName=table_name)
    status = response['Table']['TableStatus']
    if status == 'ACTIVE':
        print(f'{table_name} is being used')
    else:
        print(f'{table_name} is not being used')
        dynamodb.delete_table(TableName=table_name)
```

This code will check if each table is being used and if it is not, it will delete the table using the `delete_table` method.

Note: Before deleting any table, make sure to confirm that it is not being used by any application or service. Deleting a table will result in permanent data loss.
