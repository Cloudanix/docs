### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the DynamoDB service.
3. In the navigation pane, choose "DAX".
4. For each DAX cluster listed in the dashboard, check the "Encryption" attribute value. If the value is set to "Disabled", the selected Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster data is not encrypted, therefore your DAX cluster is not compliant.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access DynamoDB resources.

2. Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the DAX clusters in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws dax describe-clusters --region <region-name>
   ```
   Replace `<region-name>` with the name of the AWS region where the DAX clusters are located.

3. The output of the above command will include details about all the DAX clusters. Look for the `SSEDescription` field in the output. If the `Status` under `SSEDescription` is 'ENABLED', it means that the DAX cluster is encrypted.

4. To automate the process, you can use a Python script with the boto3 library to list all DAX clusters and check their encryption status. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_dax_encryption(region_name):
       dax = boto3.client('dax', region_name=region_name)
       clusters = dax.describe_clusters()
       for cluster in clusters['Clusters']:
           if cluster['SSEDescription']['Status'] != 'ENABLED':
               print(f"DAX cluster {cluster['ClusterName']} is not encrypted.")

   check_dax_encryption('<region-name>')
   ```
   Replace `<region-name>` with the name of the AWS region where the DAX clusters are located. This script will print the names of all DAX clusters that are not encrypted.

#### Using Python

To check if DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) clusters are encrypted in DynamoDB using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS:**

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import BotoCoreError, ClientError

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

2. **Create a DAX client using the session:**

```python
dax = session.client('dax')
```

3. **List all DAX clusters and check their encryption status:**

```python
def check_dax_encryption():
    clusters = dax.describe_clusters()
    for cluster in clusters['Clusters']:
        if 'SSEDescription' in cluster:
            if cluster['SSEDescription']['Status'] != 'ENABLED':
                print(f"DAX cluster {cluster['ClusterName']} is not encrypted.")
        else:
            print(f"DAX cluster {cluster['ClusterName']} does not have encryption enabled.")
```

4. **Call the function to start the check:**

```python
check_dax_encryption()
```

This script will print out the names of all DAX clusters that do not have encryption enabled. Please replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'` and `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'` with your actual AWS access key and secret key.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of an unencrypted DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster in AWS, you can follow these steps:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/) and log in to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to DynamoDB Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top left corner of the console, then select "DynamoDB" under the Database category.

3. **Select the DAX Cluster**: In the DynamoDB console, locate the DAX service in the left-hand navigation pane and click on it to view your DAX clusters.

4. **Select the Unencrypted DAX Cluster**: Identify the unencrypted DAX cluster that needs to be encrypted and click on its name to open its details.

5. **Modify the DAX Cluster**: On the DAX cluster details page, click on the "Modify" button to make changes to the cluster configuration.

6. **Enable Encryption**: In the Modify Cluster settings, scroll down to the "Encryption" section and select the option to enable encryption for the DAX cluster.

7. **Choose Encryption Type**: Choose the type of encryption you want to use for the DAX cluster. You can select AWS Managed Key (AWS KMS) or Customer Managed Key (CMK) based on your security requirements.

8. **Save Changes**: Once you have selected the encryption type, scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the "Modify" button to apply the changes.

9. **Monitor Encryption Status**: After modifying the DAX cluster to enable encryption, monitor the cluster status to ensure that the encryption is successfully applied.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of an unencrypted DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster in AWS and ensure that your data is protected with encryption.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) Cluster not being encrypted in AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. List all the existing DAX clusters to identify the one that needs to be encrypted:
```bash
aws dax describe-clusters
```

2. Identify the DAX cluster that needs to be encrypted based on the cluster name or other relevant details.

3. Enable encryption for the identified DAX cluster using the following command:
```bash
aws dax update-cluster --cluster-name YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --sse-specification Enabled=true
```
Replace `YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME` with the actual name of the DAX cluster that needs to be encrypted.

4. Verify that encryption has been enabled for the DAX cluster by checking the cluster details:
```bash
aws dax describe-clusters --cluster-name YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME
```

5. Once encryption is enabled successfully, the DAX cluster data will be encrypted at rest.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of a non-encrypted DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) Cluster in AWS using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of an unencrypted DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

Step 2: Use the following Python script to enable encryption for the DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster:

```python
import boto3

def encrypt_dax_cluster(dax_cluster_name):
    client = boto3.client('dax')

    # Get the current configuration of the DAX cluster
    response = client.describe_clusters(ClusterNames=[dax_cluster_name])

    # Check if the DAX cluster is encrypted
    if not response['Clusters'][0]['SSEDescription']['Status'] == 'ENABLED':
        # Enable encryption for the DAX cluster
        response = client.update_cluster(
            ClusterName=dax_cluster_name,
            SSESpecification={
                'Enabled': True
            }
        )
        print(f"Encryption enabled for DAX cluster: {dax_cluster_name}")
    else:
        print(f"DAX cluster: {dax_cluster_name} is already encrypted.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    dax_cluster_name = 'your-dax-cluster-name'
    encrypt_dax_cluster(dax_cluster_name)
```

Step 3: Replace `'your-dax-cluster-name'` with the actual name of your DAX cluster in the script.

Step 4: Run the Python script. This script will check if the DAX cluster is already encrypted. If not, it will enable encryption for the specified DAX cluster.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of an unencrypted DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster in AWS using Python.
