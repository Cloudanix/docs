1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Kinesis console. You can do this by typing "Kinesis" into the search bar and selecting "Kinesis" from the dropdown menu.
3. In the Kinesis console, select "Data Streams" from the navigation pane on the left side of the screen.
4. Select the name of the stream you want to check. This will bring up the details of the stream.
5. In the "Details" section, look for the "Encryption" field. If the stream is encrypted with a CMK, it will say "KMS". If it is not, it will say "None".

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access Kinesis Stream and DynamoDB.

2. Once AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can use the following command to list all the Kinesis streams:

   ```
   aws kinesis list-streams
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the Kinesis streams in your AWS account.

3. To check if a specific Kinesis stream is encrypted with a CMK, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws kinesis describe-stream --stream-name your-stream-name
   ```

   Replace 'your-stream-name' with the name of your Kinesis stream. This command will return a JSON object that contains information about the stream.

4. In the returned JSON object, look for the 'StreamDescription' field. Inside this field, there should be a 'StreamEncryptionType' field. If the value of this field is 'KMS', then the stream is encrypted with a CMK. If the value is 'NONE', then the stream is not encrypted. If the 'StreamEncryptionType' field is not present, then the stream is not encrypted.

   Here is an example of what the 'StreamDescription' field might look like for a stream that is encrypted with a CMK:

   ```
   "StreamDescription": {
       ...
       "StreamEncryptionType": "KMS",
       ...
   }
   ```

   If the 'StreamEncryptionType' field is not present or if its value is 'NONE', then the stream is not encrypted.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:
```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials:
```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```
Replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your actual AWS access key and secret key.

3. Now, create a Kinesis client and list all the Kinesis streams:
```python
kinesis = session.client('kinesis')
streams = kinesis.list_streams()
```

4. For each stream, describe the stream and check if it's encrypted with a CMK:
```python
for stream_name in streams['StreamNames']:
    stream_description = kinesis.describe_stream(StreamName=stream_name)
    if 'StreamEncryptionType' in stream_description['StreamDescription']:
        if stream_description['StreamDescription']['StreamEncryptionType'] == 'KMS':
            print(f"Stream {stream_name} is encrypted with a CMK")
        else:
            print(f"Stream {stream_name} is not encrypted with a CMK")
    else:
        print(f"Stream {stream_name} does not have encryption enabled")
```
This script will print out the names of all Kinesis streams and whether they are encrypted with a CMK or not.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of a Kinesis Stream encrypted with a Customer Master Key (CMK) for AWS DynamoDB using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Access the AWS Management Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com.

2. **Navigate to DynamoDB Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top left corner of the console. Under the "Database" section, click on "DynamoDB" to open the DynamoDB dashboard.

3. **Select the DynamoDB Table**: In the DynamoDB dashboard, locate and click on the table that you want to remediate the encryption settings for.

4. **Edit Table Encryption Settings**:
   - Click on the "Overview" tab to view the details of the selected DynamoDB table.
   - In the "Overview" tab, click on the "Manage" button next to the "Encryption" section.

5. **Update Encryption Settings**:
   - In the "Encryption" settings page, locate the "Encryption Type" section.
   - Click on the "Edit" button to modify the encryption settings for the DynamoDB table.

6. **Select Encryption Type**:
   - In the "Edit encryption" dialog box, choose the desired encryption type. To remediate the misconfiguration of Kinesis Stream encryption with CMK, select "AWS managed key (AWS KMS)".

7. **Choose AWS Managed Key (KMS)**:
   - Select the appropriate AWS managed key (KMS) from the dropdown list. Ensure that you choose the key that aligns with your security and compliance requirements.

8. **Save Changes**:
   - After selecting the AWS managed key (KMS), click on the "Save" button to apply the encryption settings changes to the DynamoDB table.

9. **Verify Encryption Settings**:
   - Once the changes are saved, verify that the encryption settings have been successfully updated to use the AWS managed key (KMS) instead of the Kinesis Stream encryption.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of a Kinesis Stream encrypted with a CMK for AWS DynamoDB using the AWS Management Console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of a Kinesis Stream encrypted with a Customer Managed Key (CMK) for AWS DynamoDB using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the DynamoDB Table**: First, identify the DynamoDB table that is using the Kinesis Stream encrypted with CMK.

2. **Disable Encryption with CMK for Kinesis Stream**: To remediate this misconfiguration, you will need to disable encryption with CMK for the Kinesis Stream associated with the DynamoDB table. You can achieve this by updating the Kinesis Stream settings.

3. **Update Kinesis Stream Encryption Settings**:
   
   - Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to update the encryption settings of the Kinesis Stream associated with the DynamoDB table:
   
     ```bash
     aws kinesis update-stream --stream-name YOUR_STREAM_NAME --encryption-type NONE
     ```
     
     Replace `YOUR_STREAM_NAME` with the actual name of the Kinesis Stream associated with the DynamoDB table.

4. **Verify Encryption Settings**: Once you have updated the encryption settings for the Kinesis Stream, verify that the encryption type is set to `NONE` to ensure that the Kinesis Stream is no longer encrypted with a CMK.

5. **Monitor DynamoDB Table**: Monitor the DynamoDB table to ensure that there are no issues or disruptions after making this change.

By following these steps and updating the encryption settings for the Kinesis Stream associated with the DynamoDB table to use encryption type `NONE`, you can remediate the misconfiguration of a Kinesis Stream encrypted with a CMK for AWS DynamoDB.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of a Kinesis Stream not being encrypted with a Customer Managed Key (CMK) in AWS, we need to create a new Kinesis Stream with encryption enabled using a CMK. Here are the step-by-step instructions on how to remediate this issue for AWS DynamoDB using Python:

1. **Import the necessary Python libraries:**
   
```python
import boto3
```

2. **Create a new Kinesis Stream with encryption enabled:**

```python
def remediate_kinesis_stream_encryption(stream_name, cmk_arn):
    client = boto3.client('kinesis')

    response = client.create_stream(
        StreamName=stream_name,
        ShardCount=1,
        EncryptionType='KMS',
        KmsKeyId=cmk_arn
    )

    print(f"New Kinesis Stream '{stream_name}' created with encryption using CMK '{cmk_arn}'")
```

3. **Replace the `stream_name` and `cmk_arn` variables with your desired values:**

```python
stream_name = 'your-kinesis-stream-name'
cmk_arn = 'your-cmk-arn'
```

4. **Call the `remediate_kinesis_stream_encryption` function with the appropriate parameters:**

```python
remediate_kinesis_stream_encryption(stream_name, cmk_arn)
```

5. **Run the Python script to create the new Kinesis Stream with encryption enabled using a CMK:**

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    remediate_kinesis_stream_encryption(stream_name, cmk_arn)
```

By following these steps and running the Python script, you can remediate the misconfiguration of a Kinesis Stream not being encrypted with a CMK in AWS DynamoDB.
