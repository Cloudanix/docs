<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent Kinesis Stream from being encrypted with a Customer Master Key (CMK) in DynamoDB using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Kinesis Stream with Default Encryption (AWS-Managed Key):**
   Ensure that when you create a Kinesis Stream, it uses the default AWS-managed key for encryption instead of a CMK.

   ```sh
   aws kinesis create-stream --stream-name my-stream --shard-count 1
   ```

2. **Enable Server-Side Encryption with AWS-Managed Key:**
   If the stream is already created, you can enable server-side encryption with the AWS-managed key.

   ```sh
   aws kinesis start-stream-encryption --stream-name my-stream --encryption-type KMS --key-id alias/aws/kinesis
   ```

3. **Verify Encryption Configuration:**
   Check the encryption configuration of your Kinesis Stream to ensure it is using the AWS-managed key.

   ```sh
   aws kinesis describe-stream --stream-name my-stream
   ```

4. **Update DynamoDB Table to Use Kinesis Stream:**
   When configuring DynamoDB to use the Kinesis Stream, ensure that the stream is correctly set up with the desired encryption settings.

   ```sh
   aws dynamodb update-table --table-name my-table --stream-specification StreamEnabled=true,StreamViewType=NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Kinesis Stream is encrypted using the AWS-managed key rather than a Customer Master Key (CMK), thereby preventing the misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent Kinesis Stream from being encrypted with a Customer Master Key (CMK) in DynamoDB using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed and configured with the necessary permissions to interact with AWS services.

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create a Kinesis Stream with Default Encryption:**
   Use Boto3 to create a Kinesis Stream without specifying a CMK, which will default to using the AWS-managed key.

   ```python
   import boto3

   kinesis_client = boto3.client('kinesis')

   response = kinesis_client.create_stream(
       StreamName='my-kinesis-stream',
       ShardCount=1
   )

   print(response)
   ```

3. **Verify Encryption Settings:**
   After creating the stream, verify that it is using the default AWS-managed key for encryption.

   ```python
   response = kinesis_client.describe_stream_summary(
       StreamName='my-kinesis-stream'
   )

   encryption_type = response['StreamDescriptionSummary']['EncryptionType']
   if encryption_type == 'KMS':
       print("Stream is encrypted with CMK.")
   else:
       print("Stream is using default encryption.")
   ```

4. **Ensure DynamoDB Streams are Not Using CMK:**
   When enabling DynamoDB Streams, ensure that they are not configured to use a CMK for encryption.

   ```python
   dynamodb_client = boto3.client('dynamodb')

   response = dynamodb_client.update_table(
       TableName='my-dynamodb-table',
       StreamSpecification={
           'StreamEnabled': True,
           'StreamViewType': 'NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES'
       }
   )

   print(response)
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Kinesis Streams and DynamoDB Streams are not using a Customer Master Key (CMK) for encryption, thereby preventing the misconfiguration.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Kinesis console. You can do this by typing "Kinesis" into the search bar and selecting "Kinesis" from the dropdown menu.
3. In the Kinesis console, select "Data Streams" from the navigation pane on the left side of the screen.
4. Select the name of the stream you want to check. This will bring up the details of the stream.
5. In the "Details" section, look for the "Encryption" field. If the stream is encrypted with a CMK, it will say "KMS". If it is not, it will say "None".
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access Kinesis Stream and DynamoDB.

2. Once AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can use the following command to list all the Kinesis streams:

   ```
   aws kinesis list-streams
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the Kinesis streams in your AWS account.

3. To check if a specific Kinesis stream is encrypted with a CMK, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws kinesis describe-stream --stream-name your-stream-name
   ```

   Replace 'your-stream-name' with the name of your Kinesis stream. This command will return a JSON object that contains information about the stream.

4. In the returned JSON object, look for the 'StreamDescription' field. Inside this field, there should be a 'StreamEncryptionType' field. If the value of this field is 'KMS', then the stream is encrypted with a CMK. If the value is 'NONE', then the stream is not encrypted. If the 'StreamEncryptionType' field is not present, then the stream is not encrypted.

   Here is an example of what the 'StreamDescription' field might look like for a stream that is encrypted with a CMK:

   ```
   "StreamDescription": {
       ...
       "StreamEncryptionType": "KMS",
       ...
   }
   ```

   If the 'StreamEncryptionType' field is not present or if its value is 'NONE', then the stream is not encrypted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:
```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials:
```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```
Replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your actual AWS access key and secret key.

3. Now, create a Kinesis client and list all the Kinesis streams:
```python
kinesis = session.client('kinesis')
streams = kinesis.list_streams()
```

4. For each stream, describe the stream and check if it's encrypted with a CMK:
```python
for stream_name in streams['StreamNames']:
    stream_description = kinesis.describe_stream(StreamName=stream_name)
    if 'StreamEncryptionType' in stream_description['StreamDescription']:
        if stream_description['StreamDescription']['StreamEncryptionType'] == 'KMS':
            print(f"Stream {stream_name} is encrypted with a CMK")
        else:
            print(f"Stream {stream_name} is not encrypted with a CMK")
    else:
        print(f"Stream {stream_name} does not have encryption enabled")
```
This script will print out the names of all Kinesis streams and whether they are encrypted with a CMK or not.
