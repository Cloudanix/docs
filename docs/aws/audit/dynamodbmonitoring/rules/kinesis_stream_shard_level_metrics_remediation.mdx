### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Kinesis Stream Shard Level Metrics in AWS, please follow the below steps using AWS Console:

1. Login to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Kinesis Streams service.
2. Select the Kinesis stream for which you want to enable shard level metrics.
3. Click on the "Monitoring" tab in the stream details page.
4. In the "Monitoring" tab, click on the "Enable Shard Level Metrics" button.
5. In the pop-up window, select the shard metrics you want to enable and click on the "Enable Shard Level Metrics" button.

Once you have enabled the shard level metrics, you can view the metrics in the CloudWatch console. You can use these metrics to monitor the performance of your Kinesis stream and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

#### Using CLI

The remediation steps for Kinesis Stream Shard Level Metrics misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI are as follows:

1. Open the AWS CLI and navigate to the Kinesis Stream service.

2. Use the following command to enable shard-level metrics on your Kinesis stream:

```
aws cloudwatch enable-metrics-collection --metrics-name IncomingBytes --namespace AWS/Kinesis --resource-id <your-stream-name> --region <your-region>
```

3. Replace `<your-stream-name>` with the name of your Kinesis stream and `<your-region>` with the AWS region where your stream is located.

4. Run the following command to confirm that shard-level metrics are enabled:

```
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace AWS/Kinesis --region <your-region>
```

5. This command should return a list of metrics, including the `IncomingBytes` metric for your Kinesis stream.

6. If you want to disable shard-level metrics for your Kinesis stream, use the following command:

```
aws cloudwatch disable-metrics-collection --metrics-name IncomingBytes --namespace AWS/Kinesis --resource-id <your-stream-name> --region <your-region>
```

7. Replace `<your-stream-name>` with the name of your Kinesis stream and `<your-region>` with the AWS region where your stream is located.

8. Run the following command to confirm that shard-level metrics are disabled:

```
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace AWS/Kinesis --region <your-region>
```

9. This command should not return the `IncomingBytes` metric for your Kinesis stream.

By following these steps, you can remediate the Kinesis Stream Shard Level Metrics misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Kinesis Stream Shard Level Metrics in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Kinesis Stream that has the misconfiguration.

2. Click on the "Monitoring" tab and locate the "Kinesis Stream Shard Level Metrics" section.

3. Check if the Shard Level Metrics are enabled. If not, click on the "Enable Shard Level Metrics" button.

4. Once enabled, click on the "View metrics in CloudWatch" button.

5. In the CloudWatch Metrics dashboard, select the Kinesis Stream and the desired metric.

6. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Create Alarm".

7. Configure the alarm threshold and notification settings as per your requirements.

8. Click on "Create Alarm" to save the changes.

9. To automate this process using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).

10. Install the Boto3 library using pip install boto3.

11. Initialize the Boto3 client for Kinesis and CloudWatch using the following code:

```python
import boto3

kinesis_client = boto3.client('kinesis')
cloudwatch_client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
```

12. Use the following code to enable Shard Level Metrics:

```python
response = kinesis_client.enable_enhanced_monitoring(
    StreamName='your_stream_name',
    ShardLevelMetrics=[
        'IncomingBytes',
        'IncomingRecords',
        'OutgoingBytes',
        'OutgoingRecords',
        'WriteProvisionedThroughputExceeded',
        'ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded'
    ]
)
```

13. Use the following code to create an alarm:

```python
response = cloudwatch_client.put_metric_alarm(
    AlarmName='your_alarm_name',
    AlarmDescription='your_alarm_description',
    ActionsEnabled=True,
    MetricName='your_metric_name',
    Namespace='AWS/Kinesis',
    Statistic='your_statistic',
    Dimensions=[
        {
            'Name': 'StreamName',
            'Value': 'your_stream_name'
        },
        {
            'Name': 'ShardId',
            'Value': 'your_shard_id'
        }
    ],
    Period=300,
    EvaluationPeriods=1,
    Threshold=your_threshold,
    ComparisonOperator='your_comparison_operator'
)
```

Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values for your use case.
