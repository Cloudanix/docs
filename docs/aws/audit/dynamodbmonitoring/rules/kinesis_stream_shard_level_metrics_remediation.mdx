<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration related to Kinesis Stream Shard Level Metrics in AWS DynamoDB using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and configure AWS CLI with the necessary credentials by running the following command:
```
aws configure
```
Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and default output format as prompted.

2. Enable Kinesis Stream Shard Level Metrics for the DynamoDB table using the AWS CLI by running the following command:
```
aws dynamodb update-continuous-backups --table-name YOUR_TABLE_NAME --point-in-time-recovery-specification PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled=true
```
Replace `YOUR_TABLE_NAME` with the name of your DynamoDB table.

3. Verify that Kinesis Stream Shard Level Metrics have been successfully enabled for the DynamoDB table by running the following command:
```
aws dynamodb describe-continuous-backups --table-name YOUR_TABLE_NAME
```
Replace `YOUR_TABLE_NAME` with the name of your DynamoDB table. Check the output to ensure that `PointInTimeRecoverySpecification` shows `PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled` as `true`.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration related to Kinesis Stream Shard Level Metrics in AWS DynamoDB using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration related to Kinesis Stream Shard Level Metrics for AWS DynamoDB using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install boto3**: If you haven't already, install the boto3 library in Python. You can do this using pip by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Update the CloudWatch Metrics Configuration**: Use the following Python script to update the CloudWatch Metrics configuration for the DynamoDB table:

```python
import boto3

def update_dynamodb_cloudwatch_metrics(table_name):
    client = boto3.client('dynamodb')

    response = client.update_continuous_backups(
        TableName=table_name,
        PointInTimeRecoverySpecification={
            'PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled': True
        }
    )

    print(response)

# Replace 'your_table_name' with the name of your DynamoDB table
update_dynamodb_cloudwatch_metrics('your_table_name')
```

3. **Run the Python Script**: Save the above Python script in a file, and run it in your Python environment. This script will enable continuous backups for the specified DynamoDB table, which will ensure that the CloudWatch Metrics for the table are properly configured.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration related to Kinesis Stream Shard Level Metrics for AWS DynamoDB using Python.
