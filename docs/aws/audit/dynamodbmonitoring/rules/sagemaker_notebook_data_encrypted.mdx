title: Notebook Data Encrypted
---

### More Info:

Ensure that the data stored on Machine Learning (ML) storage volumes attached to your AWS SageMaker notebook instances is encrypted in order to meet regulatory requirements and protect your SageMaker data at rest. SageMaker is a fully-managed AWS service that enables developers and data engineers to quickly and easily build, train and deploy machine learning models at any scale. An AWS SageMaker notebook instance is a fully managed ML instance that is running the Jupyter Notebook open-source web application.

How to enable encryption for Sagemaker Notebook data.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon SageMaker service.
2. Click on "Notebook instances" in the navigation panel on the left side.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Notebook Data Encrypted" Policy.)
3. Select the notebook instance for which you want to enable encryption.
4. In the notebook instance details page, click on the "Edit" button.
5. In the "Permissions and encryption" section, locate the "Encryption" option.
6. Click on the "Encrypt root storage volume" checkbox to enable encryption for the root storage volume.
7. Choose the desired encryption key from the "KMS key" dropdown menu. You can either select an existing KMS key or create a new one.
8. Optionally, you can also enable encryption for the additional storage volumes (if attached) by checking the corresponding checkboxes and selecting appropriate KMS keys.
9. After selecting the encryption options, click on the "Update" button.
10. A confirmation message will appear, indicating that the encryption settings have been updated.
11. Your Amazon SageMaker notebook instance is now configured with encryption for its data volumes.
