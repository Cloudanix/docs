Ensure that your Amazon SageMaker notebook instances are running inside a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in order to be able to access VPC-only resources such as Amazon EFS file systems or resources which can't be accessed outside a VPC network. A SageMaker notebook instance is a Machine Learning (ML) compute instance running on Jupyter Notebook software.

How to ensure Sagemaker Notebook instances are in VPC

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon SageMaker service.
2. From the SageMaker dashboard, click on "Notebook instances" in the left sidebar.
3. Select the notebook instance for which you want to enable VPC settings.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance In VPC" Policy.)
4. Click on the "Edit" button to modify the notebook instance settings.
5. In the "Permissions and encryption" section, under "Network," select the desired VPC configuration.
6. Choose one of the following options:
   - "No VPC" to launch the notebook instance without a VPC.
   - "Create a new VPC" to create a new VPC specifically for the notebook instance.
   - "Choose an existing VPC" to select an existing VPC from your account.
7. If you choose to create a new VPC, provide the necessary details such as VPC name, CIDR block, and subnet configuration.
8. If you choose to select an existing VPC, choose the desired VPC from the drop-down list.
9. Optionally, you can also select the security groups that should be associated with the notebook instance.
10. Review and save the changes to apply the VPC configuration to the notebook instance.
