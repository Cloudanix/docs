### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon SageMaker dashboard. From the left navigation pane, select "Notebook instances".
3. In the "Notebook instances" panel, select the name of the notebook instance that you want to examine.
4. In the "Permissions and encryption" section, check the "VPC" field. If the field value is set to "No VPC attached", the selected Amazon SageMaker notebook instance is not launched within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Once you have AWS CLI installed and configured, you can start using it to interact with AWS services.

2. To check the Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance in VPC, you need to list all the notebook instances first. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws sagemaker list-notebook-instances --region your-region-name
   ```
   Replace 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region. This command will return a list of all the notebook instances in the specified region.

3. Once you have the list of notebook instances, you can describe each notebook instance to get more details about it. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws sagemaker describe-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name your-notebook-instance-name --region your-region-name
   ```
   Replace 'your-notebook-instance-name' with the name of your notebook instance and 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region. This command will return detailed information about the specified notebook instance.

4. In the output of the above command, look for the 'DirectInternetAccess' field. If the value of this field is 'Enabled', it means that the notebook instance is not in a VPC. If the value is 'Disabled', it means that the notebook instance is in a VPC.

#### Using Python

To check if Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances are in a VPC, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Setup AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to set up Boto3. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

   ```python
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. **List all SageMaker Notebook Instances:**
   Use the `list_notebook_instances()` function to get all the SageMaker Notebook Instances.

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('sagemaker')

   response = client.list_notebook_instances()
   ```

3. **Check if the Notebook Instances are in a VPC:**
   The `list_notebook_instances()` function returns a list of notebook instances. For each instance, check the `DirectInternetAccess` attribute. If it's set to 'Disabled', the instance is in a VPC.

   ```python
   for instance in response['NotebookInstances']:
       if instance['DirectInternetAccess'] == 'Disabled':
           print(f"Notebook Instance {instance['NotebookInstanceName']} is in a VPC")
       else:
           print(f"Notebook Instance {instance['NotebookInstanceName']} is not in a VPC")
   ```

4. **Handle Pagination:**
   The `list_notebook_instances()` function returns a maximum of 100 instances at a time. If you have more than 100 instances, you need to handle pagination using the `NextToken` parameter.

   ```python
   while 'NextToken' in response:
       response = client.list_notebook_instances(NextToken=response['NextToken'])
       for instance in response['NotebookInstances']:
           if instance['DirectInternetAccess'] == 'Disabled':
               print(f"Notebook Instance {instance['NotebookInstanceName']} is in a VPC")
           else:
               print(f"Notebook Instance {instance['NotebookInstanceName']} is not in a VPC")
   ```

Please note that this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to list and describe SageMaker Notebook Instances. If you don't, you'll need to adjust your IAM policies accordingly.
