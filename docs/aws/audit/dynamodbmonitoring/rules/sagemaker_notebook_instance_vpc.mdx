### More Info:

Ensure that your Amazon SageMaker notebook instances are running inside a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in order to be able to access VPC-only resources such as Amazon EFS file systems or resources which can't be accessed outside a VPC network. A SageMaker notebook instance is a Machine Learning (ML) compute instance running on Jupyter Notebook software.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Cost optimization, Operational Maturity, Security

### Compliance Standards

CISAWS, HIPAA, ISO27001

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Here are the step by step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration of "Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance In VPC" for AWS using AWS console:

1. Open the Amazon SageMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/.
2. From the navigation pane, choose "Notebook instances".
3. Select the notebook instance that you want to remediate.
4. Choose the "Actions" dropdown and select "Update network settings".
5. In the "Network settings" section, choose "Edit".
6. Choose the "No VPC" option to remove the notebook instance from the VPC.
7. Choose the "Update network settings" button to save the changes.

After following these steps, the notebook instance will be removed from the VPC and will be accessible from the internet. If you want to keep the notebook instance in a VPC, you can choose the "VPC" option and select the appropriate VPC and subnet.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of an Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance in VPC in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Create a VPC and Subnet
- Open the Amazon VPC console and create a new VPC.
- Create a new subnet in the VPC created in the previous step.

Step 2: Create a Security Group
- Open the Amazon VPC console and create a new security group.
- Add an inbound rule to allow traffic on port 8888 (default port for Jupyter notebooks).

Step 3: Launch a New Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance
- Open the Amazon SageMaker console and launch a new Notebook instance.
- In the "Network settings" section, choose the VPC and subnet created in step 1.
- In the "Security group" section, choose the security group created in step 2.

Step 4: Verify the Configuration
- After launching the Notebook instance, verify that it is running in the selected VPC and subnet.
- Verify that the security group allows inbound traffic on port 8888.

You can also use AWS CloudFormation to automate the above steps and ensure that the configuration is consistent across multiple Notebook instances.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance in VPC for AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon SageMaker service.

2. Select the Notebook Instances option from the left-hand menu.

3. Identify the Notebook Instance that is not in a VPC.

4. Click on the Notebook Instance name to open its details page.

5. Click on the Edit button at the top of the page.

6. In the Network section, select the VPC and Subnet that you want to associate with the Notebook Instance.

7. Click on the Save button to apply the changes.

Alternatively, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to remediate this misconfiguration programmatically. Here is an example Python script that can be used to associate a Notebook Instance with a VPC:

```python
import boto3

# Define the AWS region and Notebook Instance name
region = 'us-west-2'
notebook_instance_name = 'my-notebook-instance'

# Create a Boto3 client for Amazon SageMaker
sm_client = boto3.client('sagemaker', region_name=region)

# Get the current Notebook Instance configuration
response = sm_client.describe_notebook_instance(NotebookInstanceName=notebook_instance_name)
network_interface_id = response['NetworkInterfaceId']

# Create a Boto3 client for Amazon EC2
ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region)

# Get the list of VPCs and Subnets in the region
vpcs = ec2_client.describe_vpcs()
subnets = ec2_client.describe_subnets()

# Choose a VPC and Subnet to associate with the Notebook Instance
vpc_id = vpcs['Vpcs'][0]['VpcId']
subnet_id = subnets['Subnets'][0]['SubnetId']

# Associate the Notebook Instance with the chosen VPC and Subnet
ec2_client.modify_network_interface_attribute(NetworkInterfaceId=network_interface_id, Groups=[], Attachment={'SubnetId': subnet_id})
```

Note: Replace the `region` and `notebook_instance_name` variables with the appropriate values for your environment. Also, make sure that the AWS credentials used by the script have the necessary permissions to modify the Notebook Instance and associated resources.
