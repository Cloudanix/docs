### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration in AWS:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the DynamoDB service.
2. Select the table that needs to be encrypted using KMS CMKs.
3. Click on the "Overview" tab and then click on the "Encryption" tab.
4. Under the "Encryption" tab, select the "AWS Key Management Service (KMS)" option.
5. Choose the KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) that you want to use for encryption. If you don't have a CMK, create one by following the instructions provided in the AWS KMS documentation.
6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, the table will be encrypted using KMS CMKs. This will ensure that the data stored in the DynamoDB table is protected and can only be accessed by authorized users.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of AWS DynamoDB tables not using KMS CMKs for encryption, follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Create a KMS CMK (Customer Managed Key) if you don't have one already. You can create a CMK using the following command:

```
aws kms create-key --description "My CMK"
```

2. Enable encryption for your DynamoDB table using the KMS CMK. You can enable encryption using the following command:

```
aws dynamodb update-table --table-name MyTable --sse-specification Enabled=true,KMSMasterKeyId=<KMS_CMK_ARN>
```

Replace `MyTable` with the name of your DynamoDB table and `<KMS_CMK_ARN>` with the ARN of the KMS CMK you created in step 1.

3. Verify that the encryption is enabled for your DynamoDB table using the following command:

```
aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name MyTable
```

This command should return a response that includes `"SSEDescription": { "Status": "ENABLED" }`.

4. Optionally, you can also enable default encryption for all new DynamoDB tables in your AWS account using the following command:

```
aws dynamodb update-continuous-backups --point-in-time-recovery-specification PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled=true
```

This command enables Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) for all new DynamoDB tables in your AWS account, which automatically encrypts the table data using a KMS CMK. 

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of AWS DynamoDB tables not using KMS CMKs for encryption.

#### Using Python

To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Identify the DynamoDB tables that are not using KMS CMKs for encryption. You can use the following Python code to list all DynamoDB tables in your AWS account:

```python
import boto3

dynamodb = boto3.client('dynamodb')
response = dynamodb.list_tables()

for table in response['TableNames']:
    print(table)
```

2. For each DynamoDB table that is not using KMS CMKs for encryption, enable encryption with a KMS CMK. You can use the following Python code to enable encryption for a DynamoDB table:

```python
import boto3

dynamodb = boto3.client('dynamodb')
table_name = 'your-table-name'
kms_key_id = 'your-kms-key-id'

response = dynamodb.update_table(
    TableName=table_name,
    SSESpecification={
        'Enabled': True,
        'SSEType': 'KMS',
        'KMSMasterKeyId': kms_key_id
    }
)

print(response)
```

Make sure to replace `your-table-name` and `your-kms-key-id` with the actual values for your DynamoDB table and KMS CMK.

3. Verify that the DynamoDB table is now using KMS CMKs for encryption. You can use the following Python code to check the encryption status of a DynamoDB table:

```python
import boto3

dynamodb = boto3.client('dynamodb')
table_name = 'your-table-name'

response = dynamodb.describe_table(
    TableName=table_name
)

print(response['Table']['SSEDescription'])
```

Make sure that the `SSEType` is set to `KMS` and the `KMSMasterKeyId` matches the ID of the KMS CMK that you specified in step 2.

Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all DynamoDB tables that are not using KMS CMKs for encryption.
