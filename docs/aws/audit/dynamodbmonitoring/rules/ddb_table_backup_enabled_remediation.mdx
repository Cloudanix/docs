### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the DynamoDB service.

3. Select the table that needs to have continuous backup enabled.

4. Click on the "Backups" tab.

5. Click on the "Create backup" button to create a manual backup of the table.

6. Click on the "Continuous backups" tab.

7. Click on the "Enable" button to enable continuous backups for the table.

8. In the pop-up window, review the details of the backup settings, and click on the "Enable" button to confirm.

9. Verify that the status of the continuous backups is "Enabled" for the table.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration by enabling continuous backups for the DynamoDB table.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of DynamoDB tables not having continuous backup enabled in AWS using AWS CLI, please follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to enable continuous backup for a DynamoDB table:

```
aws dynamodb update-continuous-backups --table-name <table-name> --point-in-time-recovery-specification PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled=True
```

Replace `<table-name>` with the name of the DynamoDB table that you want to enable continuous backup for.

3. Verify that the continuous backup is enabled by running the following command:

```
aws dynamodb describe-continuous-backups --table-name <table-name>
```

This command should return a response that includes the status of the continuous backup for the specified table.

4. Repeat the above steps for all the DynamoDB tables that do not have continuous backup enabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of DynamoDB tables not having continuous backup enabled in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "DynamoDB tables should have continuous backup enabled" in AWS, you can write a Python script using the AWS SDK boto3 to enable continuous backups for all DynamoDB tables in your AWS account. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. Install the boto3 library using pip:
```
pip install boto3
```

2. Create an AWS session using your AWS access key and secret key:
```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
)
```

3. Create a DynamoDB client using the session:
```python
dynamodb = session.client('dynamodb')
```

4. Use the `list_tables` method to get a list of all DynamoDB tables in your account:
```python
table_list = dynamodb.list_tables()['TableNames']
```

5. Loop through the table list and enable continuous backups for each table using the `update_continuous_backups` method:
```python
for table_name in table_list:
    dynamodb.update_continuous_backups(
        TableName=table_name,
        PointInTimeRecoverySpecification={
            'PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled': True
        }
    )
```

6. Verify that continuous backups are enabled for each table by checking the `PointInTimeRecoverySpecification` attribute using the `describe_continuous_backups` method:
```python
for table_name in table_list:
    response = dynamodb.describe_continuous_backups(
        TableName=table_name
    )
    if response['ContinuousBackupsDescription']['PointInTimeRecoverySpecification']['PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled']:
        print(f"Continuous backups enabled for table {table_name}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to enable continuous backups for table {table_name}")
```

That's it! Running this script will enable continuous backups for all DynamoDB tables in your AWS account.
