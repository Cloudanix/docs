### More Info:

Amazon DynamoDB tables should be using AWS-managed Customer Master Keys (CMKs) instead of AWS-owned CMKs for Server-Side Encryption (SSE), in order to meet strict encryption compliance and regulatory requirements. DynamoDB supports to switch from AWS-owned CMKs to customer-managed CMKs managed using Amazon Key Management Service (KMS), without any code to encrypt the data.
