### More Info:

Amazon DynamoDB tables should be using AWS-managed Customer Master Keys (CMKs) instead of AWS-owned CMKs for Server-Side Encryption (SSE), in order to meet strict encryption compliance and regulatory requirements. DynamoDB supports to switch from AWS-owned CMKs to customer-managed CMKs managed using Amazon Key Management Service (KMS), without any code to encrypt the data.

How to use CMK for Dynamo DB tables?

### Using AWS Console

To use a Customer Managed Key (CMK) for encrypting DynamoDB tables in AWS, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a CMK: Start by creating a CMK in AWS Key Management Service (KMS). You can create a CMK using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.

2. Assign the appropriate permissions to the CMK: Ensure that the IAM roles or users that need access to the DynamoDB tables have the necessary permissions to use the CMK. You can assign the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:Encrypt` permissions to the IAM entities that will interact with the DynamoDB tables.

3. Enable encryption on the DynamoDB table: Open the DynamoDB console and navigate to the table you want to encrypt. Click on the "Manage encryption" button in the table overview.

4. Choose CMK: In the encryption management panel, select "AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)" as the encryption type. Choose the CMK you created in step 1 from the drop-down list.

5. Enable encryption: Click on the "Enable" button to enable encryption for the DynamoDB table using the chosen CMK.

6. Verify encryption: Once the encryption is enabled, DynamoDB will encrypt the data at rest using the CMK. You can verify the encryption status by checking the table details in the DynamoDB console.

By following these steps, you can use a CMK to encrypt your DynamoDB tables. It ensures that the data stored in the tables is encrypted at rest, and the CMK provides control and management over the encryption keys.
