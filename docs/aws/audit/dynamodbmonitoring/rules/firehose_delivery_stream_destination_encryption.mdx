### More Info:

Ensure that your Kinesis Firehose delivery stream data records are encrypted at destination (i.e. Amazon S3) in order to meet regulatory requirements and protect your Firehose data at rest. The Firehose data records can be encrypted in the destination bucket using an AWS-managed CMK or a KMS Customer Master Key (CMK).

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Cost optimization, Operational Maturity, Security

### Compliance Standards

HIPAA, GDPR, CISAWS, CBP, NIST

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the Firehose Delivery Stream Destination Encryption misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow the below steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. Login to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon Kinesis Firehose service.

2. Select the Firehose Delivery Stream that you want to remediate.

3. Click on the "Edit" button to modify the settings of the delivery stream.

4. In the "Destination" section, select the destination you want to remediate (e.g. S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch, etc.).

5. Under the "Server-side encryption" section, select the option "AWS KMS - Key Management Service" and choose the KMS key that you want to use for encryption.

6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

7. Wait for the delivery stream to be updated with the new encryption settings.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the Firehose Delivery Stream Destination Encryption misconfiguration in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the Firehose Delivery Stream Destination Encryption misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to get the details of the Firehose Delivery Stream:

   ```
   aws firehose describe-delivery-stream --delivery-stream-name <delivery-stream-name>
   ```

3. Check the value of the `DestinationEncryptionConfiguration` parameter in the output. If it is not set to `true`, then the destination encryption is not enabled.

4. To enable the destination encryption, run the following command:

   ```
   aws firehose update-destination --delivery-stream-name <delivery-stream-name> --current-delivery-stream-version-id <delivery-stream-version-id> --destination-id <destination-id> --s3-destination-update '{"EncryptionConfiguration": {"NoEncryptionConfig": "false"}}'
   ```

   Replace `<delivery-stream-name>`, `<delivery-stream-version-id>`, and `<destination-id>` with the actual values.

5. After running the command, the `DestinationEncryptionConfiguration` parameter in the output of the `describe-delivery-stream` command should be set to `true`. This means that the destination encryption is now enabled for the Firehose Delivery Stream.

Note: Enabling the destination encryption may cause additional charges. Please refer to the AWS documentation for more information.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Firehose Delivery Stream Destination Encryption misconfiguration in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the `boto3` library to interact with AWS services using Python.

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create a `firehose` client object to interact with the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose service.

```python
firehose = boto3.client('firehose')
```

3. List all the existing delivery streams using the `list_delivery_streams` method.

```python
response = firehose.list_delivery_streams()
```

4. Loop through each delivery stream and check if it has destination encryption enabled. If not, enable it using the `update_destination` method.

```python
for stream in response['DeliveryStreamNames']:
    destination_description = firehose.describe_delivery_stream(DeliveryStreamName=stream)['DeliveryStreamDescription']['Destinations'][0]
    if not destination_description.get('EncryptionConfiguration'):
        firehose.update_destination(
            DeliveryStreamName=stream,
            CurrentDeliveryStreamVersionId=destination_description['VersionId'],
            DestinationId=destination_description['DestinationId'],
            S3DestinationUpdate={
                'EncryptionConfiguration': {
                    'KMSEncryptionConfig': {
                        'AWSKMSKeyARN': 'arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b456c789'
                    }
                },
                'BucketARN': 'arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket',
                'RoleARN': 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-firehose-role'
            }
        )
```

Note: Replace `arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b456c789` with the ARN of your KMS key and `arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket` and `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-firehose-role` with the ARN of your S3 bucket and IAM role respectively.

5. Run the Python script to remediate the Firehose Delivery Stream Destination Encryption misconfiguration in AWS.
