### More Info:

Ensure that your Kinesis Firehose delivery stream data records are encrypted at destination (i.e. Amazon S3) in order to meet regulatory requirements and protect your Firehose data at rest. The Firehose data records can be encrypted in the destination bucket using an AWS-managed CMK or a KMS Customer Master Key (CMK).

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Cost optimization, Operational Maturity, Security

### Compliance Standards

HIPAA, GDPR, CISAWS, CBP, NIST

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Kinesis console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesis.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Data Firehose".

3. In the list of delivery streams, choose the name of the delivery stream that you want to check.

4. In the details pane, under "Destination details", check the "Amazon DynamoDB" section. If the "Encryption" field is set to "Disabled", then the data written by the selected Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream is not encrypted at rest within the DynamoDB table.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Firehose Delivery Stream and DynamoDB.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the delivery streams using the following command:
   ```
   aws firehose list-delivery-streams
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the delivery streams in your AWS account.

3. To check the configuration of a specific delivery stream, use the following command:
   ```
   aws firehose describe-delivery-stream --delivery-stream-name <your-delivery-stream-name>
   ```
   Replace `<your-delivery-stream-name>` with the name of your delivery stream. This command will return the configuration of the specified delivery stream.

4. In the output of the above command, look for the `DestinationDescription` field. This field contains the configuration of the destination for the delivery stream. If the `DestinationDescription` field contains a `DynamoDBDestinationDescription` field, then the delivery stream is configured to send data to a DynamoDB table. In the `DynamoDBDestinationDescription` field, check the `SSEDescription` field. If this field is present and its `Status` field is set to `ENABLED`, then the delivery stream is encrypted. If the `SSEDescription` field is not present or its `Status` field is not set to `ENABLED`, then the delivery stream is not encrypted.

#### Using Python

To check Firehose Delivery Stream Destination Encryption in DynamoDB using python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary modules and create a session**:
   You need to import Boto3 and create a session using your AWS credentials.

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='YOUR_REGION'
   )
   ```

2. **Create a Firehose client**:
   Use the session to create a Firehose client.

   ```python
   firehose = session.client('firehose')
   ```

3. **List all delivery streams**:
   Use the `list_delivery_streams` method to get all the delivery streams.

   ```python
   response = firehose.list_delivery_streams()
   delivery_streams = response['DeliveryStreamNames']
   ```

4. **Check the encryption configuration**:
   For each delivery stream, use the `describe_delivery_stream` method to get its details and check the `EncryptionConfiguration` field.

   ```python
   for stream in delivery_streams:
       response = firehose.describe_delivery_stream(DeliveryStreamName=stream)
       encryption_config = response['DeliveryStreamDescription']['Destinations'][0]['ExtendedS3DestinationDescription']['EncryptionConfiguration']
       if encryption_config['NoEncryptionConfig'] == 'NoEncryption':
           print(f"Delivery Stream {stream} is not encrypted.")
   ```

This script will print the names of all delivery streams that are not encrypted. Please replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'`, `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'`, and `'YOUR_REGION'` with your actual AWS credentials and region.
