### More Info:

Ensure that your Kinesis Firehose delivery stream data records are encrypted at destination (i.e. Amazon S3) in order to meet regulatory requirements and protect your Firehose data at rest. The Firehose data records can be encrypted in the destination bucket using an AWS-managed CMK or a KMS Customer Master Key (CMK).

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Cost optimization, Operational Maturity, Security

### Compliance Standards

HIPAA, GDPR, CISAWS, CBP, NIST

<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Kinesis service. In the navigation pane, under Data Firehose, choose Delivery streams.
3. In the list of delivery streams, choose the name of the stream that you want to check.
4. In the details pane, under Destinations, check the details of the Amazon DynamoDB destination. If Server-side encryption is listed as Disabled, then the data written by the selected Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream to the specified DynamoDB table is not encrypted using AWS KMS.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Firehose Delivery Stream and DynamoDB.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the delivery streams in your account using the following command:
   ```
   aws firehose list-delivery-streams
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the delivery streams in your account.

3. To check the configuration of a specific delivery stream, use the following command:
   ```
   aws firehose describe-delivery-stream --delivery-stream-name <your-delivery-stream-name>
   ```
   Replace `<your-delivery-stream-name>` with the name of your delivery stream. This command will return a JSON object that contains the configuration of the delivery stream.

4. To check if the Firehose Delivery Stream Destination Encryption in DynamoDB is enabled, you need to look for the `S3DestinationDescription` or `ExtendedS3DestinationDescription` field in the JSON object. If the `SSEDescription` field under these is present and the `Status` is `ENABLED`, then the encryption is enabled. If the `SSEDescription` field is not present or the `Status` is not `ENABLED`, then the encryption is not enabled.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check Firehose Delivery Stream Destination Encryption in DynamoDB using python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary modules and create a session**:
   You need to import Boto3 and create a session using your AWS credentials.

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='YOUR_REGION'
   )
   ```

2. **Create a Firehose client**:
   Use the session to create a Firehose client.

   ```python
   firehose = session.client('firehose')
   ```

3. **List all delivery streams**:
   Use the `list_delivery_streams` method to get all the delivery streams.

   ```python
   response = firehose.list_delivery_streams()
   delivery_streams = response['DeliveryStreamNames']
   ```

4. **Check the destination encryption**:
   For each delivery stream, use the `describe_delivery_stream` method to get its details and check if the destination encryption is enabled.

   ```python
   for stream in delivery_streams:
       response = firehose.describe_delivery_stream(DeliveryStreamName=stream)
       destination = response['DeliveryStreamDescription']['Destinations'][0]
       if 'ExtendedS3DestinationDescription' in destination:
           encryption = destination['ExtendedS3DestinationDescription']['S3DestinationDescription']['EncryptionConfiguration']
           if encryption['NoEncryptionConfig'] == 'NoEncryption':
               print(f"Delivery Stream {stream} has no destination encryption.")
   ```

This script will print the names of all delivery streams that have no destination encryption. Please replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'`, `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'`, and `'YOUR_REGION'` with your actual AWS credentials and region.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of Firehose Delivery Stream Destination Encryption for AWS DynamoDB using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to Amazon Kinesis**: In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the Amazon Kinesis service by either searching for it in the search bar or locating it under the "Analytics" section.

3. **Select the Kinesis Data Firehose service**: Click on "Kinesis Data Firehose" from the list of services.

4. **Choose your Delivery Stream**: Select the specific delivery stream that is connected to the DynamoDB table that you want to remediate.

5. **Edit the Delivery Stream**: Click on the "Edit" button to modify the settings of the delivery stream.

6. **Enable Server-Side Encryption**: In the "Destination" section, locate the "Server-Side Encryption" option and enable it.

7. **Select the Encryption Type**: Choose the appropriate encryption type for your DynamoDB data. You can select either "AWS KMS master key" or "Amazon S3 master key" based on your security requirements.

8. **Configure Encryption Settings**: Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the encryption settings, such as selecting the KMS key or S3 key to use for encryption.

9. **Save Changes**: Once you have configured the encryption settings, click on the "Save" button to apply the changes to the delivery stream.

10. **Verify Encryption Configuration**: After saving the changes, verify that the server-side encryption is enabled for the delivery stream by checking the settings.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Firehose Delivery Stream Destination Encryption for AWS DynamoDB using the AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of Firehose Delivery Stream Destination Encryption for AWS DynamoDB using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Use the following AWS CLI command to update the Firehose Delivery Stream with the correct encryption settings:
   
```bash
aws firehose update-destination --delivery-stream-name YOUR_DELIVERY_STREAM_NAME --current-delivery-stream-version-id YOUR_DELIVERY_STREAM_VERSION_ID --destination-id YOUR_DESTINATION_ID --extended-s3-destination-update '{ "EncryptionConfiguration": { "NoEncryptionConfig": {} } }'
```

Replace the placeholders with the actual values:
- `YOUR_DELIVERY_STREAM_NAME`: The name of your Firehose Delivery Stream.
- `YOUR_DELIVERY_STREAM_VERSION_ID`: The version ID of your Firehose Delivery Stream.
- `YOUR_DESTINATION_ID`: The ID of the destination you want to update.

3. After running the command, the Firehose Delivery Stream Destination Encryption for AWS DynamoDB should be successfully updated to use no encryption.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration of Firehose Delivery Stream Destination Encryption for AWS DynamoDB using AWS CLI.
