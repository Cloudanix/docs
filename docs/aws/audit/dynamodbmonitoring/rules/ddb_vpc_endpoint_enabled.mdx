title: VPC Endpoint Should Be Enabled For DynamoDB
---

### More Info:

A VPC endpoint for DynamoDB enables Amazon EC2 instances in your VPC to use their private IP addresses to access DynamoDB with no exposure to the public internet. Your EC2 instances do not require public IP addresses, and you do not need an internet gateway, a NAT device, or a virtual private gateway in your VPC.
