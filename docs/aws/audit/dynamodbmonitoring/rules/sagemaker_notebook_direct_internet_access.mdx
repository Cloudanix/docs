How to ensure Sagemaker Notebook instances are not publicly accessible

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon SageMaker service.
2. From the SageMaker dashboard, click on "Notebook instances" in the left sidebar.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Notebook Direct Internet Access" Policy.)
3. Select the notebook instance for which you want to configure the access.
4. Click on the "Edit" button to modify the notebook instance settings.
5. In the "Permissions and encryption" section, under "Network," select the appropriate VPC configuration. Choose either "Create a new VPC" or "Choose an existing VPC" based on your requirements. Make sure the selected VPC does not have public internet access.
6. If you choose to create a new VPC, provide the necessary details such as VPC name, CIDR block, and subnet configuration. Ensure that the subnet associated with the notebook instance does not have a route to the internet gateway.
7. If you choose to select an existing VPC, choose the desired VPC from the drop-down list. Verify that the VPC and associated subnets are not publicly accessible.
8. Optionally, you can also select the security groups that should be associated with the notebook instance. Ensure that the security groups allow only the necessary inbound and outbound traffic for your specific use case.
9. Review and save the changes to apply the VPC configuration to the notebook instance.
