### More Info:

Ensure that your Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams are encrypted using Server-Side Encryption. It is recommended for added security to use KMS Customer-managed Customer Master Keys (CMKs) instead of AWS managed-keys, in order to have full control over the encryption and decryption process and meet regulatory requirements. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service designed for real-time streaming data delivery to destinations such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon ElasticSearch Service, and Splunk.
