### More Info:

Ensure that the storage volumes attached to your Amazon SageMaker notebook instances are encrypted with KMS Customer Master Keys (CMKs) instead of AWS managed-keys in order to have a more granular control over the data-at-rest encryption/decryption process and meet compliance requirements. SageMaker is a fully-managed AWS service that enables data scientists and developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale. Amazon SageMaker removes the barriers that typically slow down data developers who want to use machine learning in the cloud. A SageMaker notebook instance is a fully managed Machine Learning (ML) instance based on the Jupyter Notebook application.
