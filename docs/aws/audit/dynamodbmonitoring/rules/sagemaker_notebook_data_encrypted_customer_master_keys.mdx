### More Info:

Ensure that the storage volumes attached to your Amazon SageMaker notebook instances are encrypted with KMS Customer Master Keys (CMKs) instead of AWS managed-keys in order to have a more granular control over the data-at-rest encryption/decryption process and meet compliance requirements. SageMaker is a fully-managed AWS service that enables data scientists and developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale. Amazon SageMaker removes the barriers that typically slow down data developers who want to use machine learning in the cloud. A SageMaker notebook instance is a fully managed Machine Learning (ML) instance based on the Jupyter Notebook application.

How to enable encryption for Sagemaker Notebook data.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon SageMaker service.
2. Click on "Notebook instances" in the navigation panel on the left side.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Notebook Data Encrypted With KMS Customer Master Keys" Policy.)
3. Select the notebook instance for which you want to enable encryption.
4. In the notebook instance details page, click on the "Edit" button.
5. In the "Permissions and encryption" section, locate the "Encryption" option.
6. Click on the "Encrypt root storage volume" checkbox to enable encryption for the root storage volume.
7. Choose the "Customer managed CMK" option from the "KMS key" dropdown menu.
8. Select the desired CMK from the "Choose a customer managed CMK" dropdown menu. If you don't have a suitable CMK, click on the "Create a customer managed CMK" link to create a new one.
9. If creating a new CMK, follow the prompts to configure the key settings, including alias, description, and permissions.
10. Once you have selected or created the CMK, click on the "Update" button.
11. A confirmation message will appear, indicating that the encryption settings have been updated.
12. Your Amazon SageMaker notebook instance is now configured with encryption for its data volumes using the specified CMK.
