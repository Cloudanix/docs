### More Info:

Ensure that the storage volumes attached to your Amazon SageMaker notebook instances are encrypted with KMS Customer Master Keys (CMKs) instead of AWS managed-keys in order to have a more granular control over the data-at-rest encryption/decryption process and meet compliance requirements. SageMaker is a fully-managed AWS service that enables data scientists and developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale. Amazon SageMaker removes the barriers that typically slow down data developers who want to use machine learning in the cloud. A SageMaker notebook instance is a fully managed Machine Learning (ML) instance based on the Jupyter Notebook application.

### Risk Level

### Address

Cost optimization, Operational Maturity, Security

### Compliance Standards

ISO27001, HIPAA

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Notebook Data Encrypted With KMS Customer Master Keys" in AWS using AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Amazon SageMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/.
2. In the left navigation pane, choose "Notebook instances".
3. Select the notebook instance for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.
4. Choose "Actions" and then choose "Update encryption".
5. In the "Update encryption" dialog box, select "Amazon S3 default encryption" and then choose "Update".
6. Once the update is complete, you will receive a message stating that the notebook instance has been updated with the new encryption configuration.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Notebook Data Encrypted With KMS Customer Master Keys" in AWS using AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Notebook Data Encrypted With KMS Customer Master Keys" in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the steps below:

1. Identify the notebook instance for which the data encryption needs to be remediated.

2. Create a new KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) if you don't already have one. You can create a new CMK using the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws kms create-key --description "CMK for notebook encryption"
```

3. Enable encryption for the notebook instance using the new CMK. You can use the following AWS CLI command to enable encryption:

```
aws sagemaker update-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <instance-name> --default-code-repository <code-repo-arn> --volume-size-in-gb <volume-size> --instance-type <instance-type> --accelerator-types <accelerator-type> --role-arn <role-arn> --subnet-id <subnet-id> --security-group-ids <security-group-id> --kms-key-id <kms-key-id>
```

Replace the following parameters in the above command:

- `<instance-name>`: The name of the notebook instance that needs to be encrypted.
- `<code-repo-arn>`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the default Git repository for the notebook instance.
- `<volume-size>`: The size of the EBS volume in GB that needs to be encrypted.
- `<instance-type>`: The type of EC2 instance that the notebook instance uses.
- `<accelerator-type>`: The type of Elastic Inference accelerator that the notebook instance uses.
- `<role-arn>`: The ARN of the IAM role that the notebook instance uses.
- `<subnet-id>`: The ID of the subnet that the notebook instance uses.
- `<security-group-id>`: The ID of the security group that the notebook instance uses.
- `<kms-key-id>`: The ARN of the KMS CMK that you created in step 2.

4. Verify that the data is now encrypted with the new KMS CMK by checking the AWS Management Console or using the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws sagemaker describe-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <instance-name> --query 'KmsKeyId'
```

This command returns the ARN of the KMS CMK that is currently used to encrypt the data for the specified notebook instance.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Notebook Data Encrypted With KMS Customer Master Keys" in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Notebook Data Encrypted With KMS Customer Master Keys" in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to identify the notebook instance that is using KMS Customer Master Keys for encryption. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all the notebook instances in your account.

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('sagemaker')

response = client.list_notebook_instances()

for instance in response['NotebookInstances']:
    print(instance['NotebookInstanceName'])
```

2. Once you have identified the notebook instance, you need to update its encryption settings to use the default encryption key provided by Amazon Sagemaker. You can do this by updating the `KmsKeyId` parameter to `None`. 

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('sagemaker')

response = client.update_notebook_instance(
    NotebookInstanceName='notebook-instance-name',
    KmsKeyId=None
)
```

3. Finally, you can verify that the encryption settings have been updated by describing the notebook instance.

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('sagemaker')

response = client.describe_notebook_instance(
    NotebookInstanceName='notebook-instance-name'
)

print(response['KmsKeyId'])
```

This should return `None`, indicating that the notebook instance is no longer using KMS Customer Master Keys for encryption.
