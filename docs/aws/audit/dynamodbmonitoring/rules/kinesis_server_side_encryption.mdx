### More Info:

Ensure that your AWS Kinesis streams are encrypted using Server-Side Encryption (SSE) in order to meet strict regulatory requirements and improve the security of your data at rest. Kinesis is a platform for streaming data on Amazon Web Services that provides you with the ability to build and manage your own custom streaming data applications for specialized needs. A Kinesis stream is an ordered sequence of data records collected within a dedicated storage layer. With SSE your sensitive data is encrypted before this is written to the Kinesis stream storage layer and decrypted after itâ€™s retrieved from storage.

### Risk Level

High

### Address

Cost optimization, Operational Maturity, Security

### Compliance Standards

HIPAA, ISO27001

### Remediation

#### Using Console
1. Go to the Amazon Kinesis console.
2. Navigate to the list of Kinesis streams.
3. Select the stream with "Encryption type" set to "NONE".
4. Click on "Details".
5. Click on "Edit".
6. Under "Data encryption", select "Enable server-side encryption".
7. Choose the KMS key or create a new one.
8. Click "Save changes".

#### Using CLI
```bash
aws kinesis update-stream --stream-name <stream-name> --encryption-type KMS --encryption-key-id <kms-key-id>
```

Replace `<stream-name>` with the name of the Kinesis stream and `<kms-key-id>` with the ID or ARN of the KMS key.

#### Using Python
```python
import boto3

def enable_kinesis_stream_encryption(stream_name, kms_key_id):
    client = boto3.client('kinesis')
    response = client.describe_stream(StreamName=stream_name)
    stream_arn = response['StreamDescription']['StreamARN']
    client.update_stream(
        StreamName=stream_name,
        EncryptionType='KMS',
        KeyId=kms_key_id
    )
    print(f"Encryption enabled for Kinesis stream: {stream_arn}")

def main():
    client = boto3.client('kinesis')
    response = client.list_streams()
    for stream_name in response['StreamNames']:
        response = client.describe_stream(StreamName=stream_name)
        encryption_type = response['StreamDescription']['EncryptionType']
        if encryption_type == 'NONE':
            kms_key_id = '<kms-key-id>'
            enable_kinesis_stream_encryption(stream_name, kms_key_id)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Replace `<kms-key-id>` with the ID or ARN of the KMS key.
