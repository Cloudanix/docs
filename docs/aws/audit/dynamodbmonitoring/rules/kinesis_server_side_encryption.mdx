### More Info:

Ensure that your AWS Kinesis streams are encrypted using Server-Side Encryption (SSE) in order to meet strict regulatory requirements and improve the security of your data at rest. Kinesis is a platform for streaming data on Amazon Web Services that provides you with the ability to build and manage your own custom streaming data applications for specialized needs. A Kinesis stream is an ordered sequence of data records collected within a dedicated storage layer. With SSE your sensitive data is encrypted before this is written to the Kinesis stream storage layer and decrypted after itâ€™s retrieved from storage.

How to enable Server Side Encryption for Kinesis Data Streams?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon Kinesis service.
2. Click on "Data streams" in the navigation panel on the left side.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Kinesis Server Side Encryption" Policy.)
3. Select the data stream for which you want to enable server-side encryption.
4. In the data stream details page, click on the "Details" tab.
5. Under the "Encryption" section, click on the "Edit" button.
6. In the "Server-side encryption" dialog box, select the desired encryption option:
   a. AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key: Choose an existing KMS key from the drop-down menu or create a new one.
   b. AWS Managed Key: Select "Use AWS managed key" to let AWS manage the encryption key.
7. After selecting the encryption option, click on the "Save" button.
8. A confirmation message will appear, indicating that the server-side encryption settings have been updated.
9. Your Kinesis data stream is now configured with server-side encryption.
