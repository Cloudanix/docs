### More Info:

Ensure that your AWS Kinesis streams are encrypted using Server-Side Encryption (SSE) in order to meet strict regulatory requirements and improve the security of your data at rest. Kinesis is a platform for streaming data on Amazon Web Services that provides you with the ability to build and manage your own custom streaming data applications for specialized needs. A Kinesis stream is an ordered sequence of data records collected within a dedicated storage layer. With SSE your sensitive data is encrypted before this is written to the Kinesis stream storage layer and decrypted after itâ€™s retrieved from storage.
