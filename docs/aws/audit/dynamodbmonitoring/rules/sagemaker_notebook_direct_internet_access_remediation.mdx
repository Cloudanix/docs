### Remediation

#### Using Console

The misconfiguration of "Notebook Direct Internet Access" in AWS means that a SageMaker notebook instance is publicly accessible over the Internet, which poses a security risk. To remediate this, follow these steps:

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon SageMaker service.

2. In the left navigation pane, select "Notebook instances".

3. Select the notebook instance that has direct internet access.

4. Click on the "Edit" button in the "Network and security" section.

5. In the "Network settings" section, change the "Direct internet access" option to "Disabled".

6. In the "Security group" section, remove any inbound rules that allow traffic from the Internet.

7. Click on the "Update" button to save the changes.

After completing these steps, the SageMaker notebook instance will no longer be publicly accessible over the Internet, and will only be accessible within the VPC or through a VPN connection.

#### Using CLI

The misconfiguration of Notebook Direct Internet Access in AWS can be remediated by following these steps using AWS CLI:

Step 1: Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to get the ID of the Amazon SageMaker notebook instance that has direct internet access enabled:

```
aws sagemaker describe-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <instance-name> --query 'DirectInternetAccess'
```

Step 2: If the output of the above command is "Enabled", then run the following command to disable direct internet access:

```
aws sagemaker update-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <instance-name> --no-direct-internet-access
```

Step 3: If the output of the above command is "Disabled", then direct internet access is already disabled and no further action is required.

By following these steps, the misconfiguration of Notebook Direct Internet Access in AWS can be remediated using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

The misconfiguration "Notebook Direct Internet Access" refers to a situation where a notebook instance in Amazon SageMaker is configured to have direct internet access, which can pose a security risk. To remediate this misconfiguration, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. Create a new Amazon SageMaker notebook instance with the correct network configuration. You can use the following Python code to create a notebook instance:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('sagemaker')

response = client.create_notebook_instance(
    NotebookInstanceName='my-notebook-instance',
    InstanceType='ml.t2.medium',
    RoleArn='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/AmazonSageMaker-ExecutionRole-20220101T000001',
    SubnetId='subnet-0123456789abcdef0',
    SecurityGroupIds=['sg-0123456789abcdef0'],
    DirectInternetAccess='Disabled'
)

print(response)
```

In this code, you need to replace the values for `NotebookInstanceName`, `InstanceType`, `RoleArn`, `SubnetId`, and `SecurityGroupIds` with the appropriate values for your environment. The `DirectInternetAccess` parameter is set to `'Disabled'` to ensure that the notebook instance does not have direct internet access.

2. Stop the existing notebook instance that has direct internet access. You can use the following Python code to stop a notebook instance:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('sagemaker')

response = client.stop_notebook_instance(
    NotebookInstanceName='my-notebook-instance'
)

print(response)
```

In this code, you need to replace the value for `NotebookInstanceName` with the name of the notebook instance that has direct internet access.

3. Start the new notebook instance that has the correct network configuration. You can use the following Python code to start a notebook instance:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('sagemaker')

response = client.start_notebook_instance(
    NotebookInstanceName='my-notebook-instance'
)

print(response)
```

In this code, you need to replace the value for `NotebookInstanceName` with the name of the new notebook instance that you created in step 1.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Notebook Direct Internet Access" in Amazon SageMaker using Python.
