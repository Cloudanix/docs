<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of Sagemaker Notebook Instance having Root Access enabled in AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. **List the Sagemaker Notebook Instances:**
   Run the following AWS CLI command to list all the Sagemaker Notebook Instances in your AWS account:
   ```
   aws sagemaker list-notebook-instances
   ```

2. **Identify the Notebook Instance with Root Access Enabled:**
   Look for the Notebook Instance that has Root Access enabled in the output of the above command. Note down the `NotebookInstanceName` of the instance.

3. **Update the IAM Role attached to the Notebook Instance:**
   Run the following AWS CLI command to update the IAM role attached to the Notebook Instance to remove Root Access:
   ```
   aws sagemaker update-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <NotebookInstanceName> --iam-role-arn <UpdatedIAMRoleARN>
