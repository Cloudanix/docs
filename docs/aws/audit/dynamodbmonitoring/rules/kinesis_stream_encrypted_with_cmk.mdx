### More Info:

Ensure Amazon Kinesis streams are utilizing KMS CMK customer-managed keys instead of AWS managed-keys (i.e. default encryption keys created by Amazon for Kinesis service) in order to have more granular control over your data streams encryption/decryption process. Kinesis is an AWS streaming data service that provides you with the ability to build and manage your own streaming data applications for specialized needs. An AWS Kinesis stream is an ordered sequence of data records collected within a dedicated storage layer.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate a Kinesis Stream encrypted with CMK in AWS using the console, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Kinesis console.
2. Select the Kinesis Stream that is encrypted with CMK.
3. Click on the "Details" tab.
4. Scroll down to the "Encryption" section and click on the "Edit" button.
5. Select "AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)" as the encryption type.
6. Choose the KMS key that you want to use for encryption.
7. Click on the "Update" button to save the changes.

After following these steps, the Kinesis Stream will be encrypted with the selected KMS key.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Kinesis Stream Encrypted With CMK" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and ensure that you have AWS CLI installed and configured on your system.

2. Run the following command to describe the Kinesis stream:

```
aws kinesis describe-stream --stream-name <stream-name>
```

3. Check the output of the above command for the "EncryptionType" parameter. If the value of this parameter is "KMS", it means that the stream is encrypted with a KMS CMK.

4. To remediate this misconfiguration, you need to disable the KMS encryption for the Kinesis stream. To do this, run the following command:

```
aws kinesis disable-stream-encryption --stream-name <stream-name>
```

5. After running the above command, the Kinesis stream will no longer be encrypted with a KMS CMK.

Note: Disabling encryption for a Kinesis stream can have security implications. Make sure that you understand the risks before taking this step.

#### Using Python

To remediate a Kinesis Stream Encrypted with CMK in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred Python IDE or text editor and create a new Python script file.

2. Import the required libraries:

```python
import boto3
```

3. Create a boto3 client for Kinesis:

```python
kinesis_client = boto3.client('kinesis')
```

4. List all the Kinesis streams in your AWS account:

```python
streams = kinesis_client.list_streams()
```

5. Loop through the streams and check if they are encrypted with a CMK:

```python
for stream in streams['StreamNames']:
    response = kinesis_client.describe_stream(StreamName=stream)
    if 'EncryptionType' in response['StreamDescription'] and response['StreamDescription']['EncryptionType'] == 'KMS':
        print(f"{stream} is encrypted with KMS.")
```

6. If a stream is encrypted with a CMK, you can remediate it by disabling encryption or changing the CMK:

```python
# Disable encryption
kinesis_client.stop_stream_encryption(StreamName=stream)

# Change CMK
kinesis_client.start_stream_encryption(StreamName=stream, EncryptionType='KMS', KeyId='new_kms_key_id')
```

7. Save the Python script file and run it to remediate the Kinesis streams encrypted with CMK in your AWS account.

Note: Before running the script, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify Kinesis streams in your AWS account.
