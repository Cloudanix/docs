### More Info:

Ensure Amazon Kinesis streams are utilizing KMS CMK customer-managed keys instead of AWS managed-keys (i.e. default encryption keys created by Amazon for Kinesis service) in order to have more granular control over your data streams encryption/decryption process. Kinesis is an AWS streaming data service that provides you with the ability to build and manage your own streaming data applications for specialized needs. An AWS Kinesis stream is an ordered sequence of data records collected within a dedicated storage layer.

How to enable Encryption with CMK for Kinesis Data Streams?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon Kinesis service.
2. Click on "Data streams" in the navigation panel on the left side.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Kinesis Stream Encrypted With CMK" Policy.)
3. Select the data stream for which you want to enable encryption with a CMK.
4. In the data stream details page, click on the "Details" tab.
5. Under the "Encryption" section, click on the "Edit" button.
6. In the "Server-side encryption" dialog box, select "AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key."
7. Click on the "Create new KMS key" button. If you have an existing CMK, you can select it from the drop-down menu instead.
8. In the "Create AWS KMS key" dialog box, choose the desired options for the CMK:
   a. Key type: Select either "Symmetric" or "Asymmetric" based on your requirements.
   b. Key alias: Provide a unique alias to identify the CMK.
   c. Key administrative permissions: Specify the IAM users or roles that can administer the key (optional).
9. Click on the "Next" button.
10. Review the key policy displayed on the "Define key policy" page. This policy controls who has access to the CMK. Make any necessary changes to the policy based on your security requirements.
11. Click on the "Next" button.
12. Review the key configuration displayed on the "Review and edit key configuration" page. Ensure that the settings align with your requirements.
13. Click on the "Finish" button.
14. In the "Server-side encryption" dialog box, the newly created CMK should now be selected. If it isn't, select it from the drop-down menu.
15. Click on the "Save" button.
16. A confirmation message will appear, indicating that the server-side encryption settings have been updated.
17. Your Kinesis data stream is now configured with encryption using the specified CMK.
