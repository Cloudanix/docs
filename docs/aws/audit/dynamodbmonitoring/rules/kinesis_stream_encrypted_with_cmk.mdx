### More Info:

Ensure Amazon Kinesis streams are utilizing KMS CMK customer-managed keys instead of AWS managed-keys (i.e. default encryption keys created by Amazon for Kinesis service) in order to have more granular control over your data streams encryption/decryption process. Kinesis is an AWS streaming data service that provides you with the ability to build and manage your own streaming data applications for specialized needs. An AWS Kinesis stream is an ordered sequence of data records collected within a dedicated storage layer.
