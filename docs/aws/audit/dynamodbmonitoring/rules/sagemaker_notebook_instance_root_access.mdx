1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon SageMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/.

2. In the left navigation pane, choose "Notebook instances".

3. In the "Notebook instances" list, choose the name of the notebook instance that you want to check.

4. In the "Permissions and encryption" section, check the "Lifecycle configuration" associated with the notebook instance. If the "Lifecycle configuration" script contains "sudo" commands, it means the notebook instance has root access enabled. 

5. Additionally, you can check the IAM role associated with the notebook instance. In the "Permissions and encryption" section, click on the IAM role ARN. This will redirect you to the IAM console. Check the policies attached to the role. If the policies provide full access to DynamoDB or any other AWS services, it means the notebook instance potentially has root access.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Sagemaker service.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the Sagemaker notebook instances using the following command:

   ```
   aws sagemaker list-notebook-instances --region your-region
   ```
   Replace 'your-region' with the region where your instances are located.

3. After listing the notebook instances, you can describe the properties of each instance using the following command:

   ```
   aws sagemaker describe-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name your-notebook-instance-name --region your-region
   ```
   Replace 'your-notebook-instance-name' with the name of your notebook instance and 'your-region' with the region where your instances are located.

4. In the output of the above command, look for the "DirectInternetAccess" field. If the value of this field is "Enabled", it means that the notebook instance has root access enabled. If the value is "Disabled", it means that root access is not enabled.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To detect if a SageMaker Notebook Instance has root access enabled, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary libraries and establish a client connection to AWS SageMaker:**

```python
import boto3

sagemaker = boto3.client('sagemaker')
```

2. **List all the SageMaker notebook instances:**

```python
notebook_instances = sagemaker.list_notebook_instances()
```

3. **Iterate over the notebook instances and check the `DirectInternetAccess` attribute:**

```python
for notebook_instance in notebook_instances['NotebookInstances']:
    if notebook_instance['DirectInternetAccess'] == 'Enabled':
        print(f"Notebook Instance {notebook_instance['NotebookInstanceName']} has root access enabled.")
```

4. **Check the Lifecycle configurations for root access:**

```python
for notebook_instance in notebook_instances['NotebookInstances']:
    lifecycle_config_name = notebook_instance.get('LifecycleConfigName')
    if lifecycle_config_name:
        lifecycle_config = sagemaker.describe_notebook_instance_lifecycle_config(
            NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfigName=lifecycle_config_name
        )
        for script in lifecycle_config['OnStart']:
            if 'sudo' in script['Content']:
                print(f"Notebook Instance {notebook_instance['NotebookInstanceName']} has root access enabled in lifecycle configuration.")
```

Please note that the above scripts only detect if the SageMaker Notebook Instances have root access enabled. It does not provide any remediation steps. Also, the scripts assume that you have the necessary permissions to list and describe the SageMaker notebook instances and their lifecycle configurations.

1. **Log in to the AWS Management Console:**
   - Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the SageMaker service.

2. **Identify Notebook Instances with Root Access Enabled:**
   - Go to the "Notebook instances" section.
   - Check each notebook instance for the "Root access" setting. Instances with root access enabled will have it specified in their details.

3. **Disable Root Access:**
   - Select the notebook instance you want to modify.
   - Click "Edit."
   - In the "Notebook instance settings," find the "Root access" setting and change it to "Disabled."
   - Save the changes and restart the notebook instance for the changes to take effect.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To disable root access for a SageMaker notebook instance using the AWS CLI, you need to update the `RootAccess` parameter.

**Identify and Update Notebook Instances:**

```sh
# List all notebook instances
aws sagemaker list-notebook-instances

# Describe a specific notebook instance to check its root access setting
aws sagemaker describe-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <YourNotebookInstanceName>

# Update the notebook instance to disable root access
aws sagemaker update-notebook-instance \
    --notebook-instance-name <YourNotebookInstanceName> \
    --root-access Disabled

# Restart the notebook instance to apply changes
aws sagemaker stop-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <YourNotebookInstanceName>
aws sagemaker start-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <YourNotebookInstanceName>
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To disable root access for SageMaker notebook instances using a Python script, you'll need the `boto3` library:

1. **Install `boto3` (if not already installed):**

```sh
pip install boto3
```

2. **Script to Identify and Update Notebook Instances:**

```python
import boto3

sagemaker = boto3.client('sagemaker')

def list_notebook_instances():
    response = sagemaker.list_notebook_instances()
    return response['NotebookInstances']

def describe_notebook_instance(notebook_instance_name):
    response = sagemaker.describe_notebook_instance(
        NotebookInstanceName=notebook_instance_name
    )
    return response

def update_notebook_instance(notebook_instance_name):
    response = sagemaker.update_notebook_instance(
        NotebookInstanceName=notebook_instance_name,
        RootAccess='Disabled'
    )
    print(response)

def restart_notebook_instance(notebook_instance_name):
    sagemaker.stop_notebook_instance(NotebookInstanceName=notebook_instance_name)
    waiter = sagemaker.get_waiter('notebook_instance_stopped')
    waiter.wait(NotebookInstanceName=notebook_instance_name)
    sagemaker.start_notebook_instance(NotebookInstanceName=notebook_instance_name)

# Identify and update notebook instances with root access enabled
notebook_instances = list_notebook_instances()
for instance in notebook_instances:
    instance_name = instance['NotebookInstanceName']
    details = describe_notebook_instance(instance_name)
    if details.get('RootAccess', '').lower() == 'enabled':
        print(f"Disabling root access for notebook instance: {instance_name}")
        update_notebook_instance(instance_name)
        restart_notebook_instance(instance_name)
```

This script will list all notebook instances, describe each one to check its root access setting, and then disable root access for those with it enabled. Finally, it will restart the modified instances to apply the changes.

Replace placeholders (`<YourNotebookInstanceName>`) with appropriate values.
