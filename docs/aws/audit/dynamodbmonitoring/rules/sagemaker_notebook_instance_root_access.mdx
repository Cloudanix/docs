### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon SageMaker dashboard.
2. In the left navigation pane, choose "Notebook instances" to open the notebook instances page.
3. On the Notebook instances page, select the notebook instance that you want to examine.
4. In the Permissions and encryption section, under IAM role ARN, check if the IAM role associated with the selected notebook instance has root access. If the IAM role has policies that grant full access (like AmazonS3FullAccess, AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess, etc.), then the notebook instance has root access enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Sagemaker and DynamoDB services.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the Sagemaker notebook instances using the following command:

   ```
   aws sagemaker list-notebook-instances --region your-region
   ```
   Replace 'your-region' with the region where your instances are located. This command will return a JSON output with all the notebook instances.

3. To check if a Sagemaker notebook instance has root access enabled, you need to describe the instance and check the 'DirectInternetAccess' attribute. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   aws sagemaker describe-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name your-instance-name --region your-region
   ```
   Replace 'your-instance-name' with the name of your instance and 'your-region' with the region where your instance is located. If the 'DirectInternetAccess' attribute is set to 'Enabled', then the instance has root access enabled.

4. To check the access control on your DynamoDB tables, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name your-table-name --region your-region
   ```
   Replace 'your-table-name' with the name of your table and 'your-region' with the region where your table is located. This command will return a JSON output with the details of the table. Check the 'ProvisionedThroughput' attribute to see if the table has any access control misconfigurations.

Please note that these commands only detect the misconfigurations. To fix them, you will need to modify the settings of the Sagemaker notebook instances and DynamoDB tables.

#### Using Python

To detect if a SageMaker Notebook Instance has root access enabled, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary libraries and establish a client connection to AWS SageMaker:**

```python
import boto3

sagemaker = boto3.client('sagemaker')
```

2. **List all the SageMaker notebook instances:**

```python
notebook_instances = sagemaker.list_notebook_instances()
```

3. **Iterate over the notebook instances and check the `DirectInternetAccess` attribute:**

```python
for notebook in notebook_instances['NotebookInstances']:
    if notebook['DirectInternetAccess'] == 'Enabled':
        print(f"Notebook Instance {notebook['NotebookInstanceName']} has root access enabled.")
```

4. **Check the Lifecycle configuration for root access:**

```python
for notebook in notebook_instances['NotebookInstances']:
    lifecycle_config = sagemaker.describe_notebook_instance(NotebookInstanceName=notebook['NotebookInstanceName'])
    if 'LifecycleConfigName' in lifecycle_config:
        lifecycle_config_detail = sagemaker.describe_notebook_instance_lifecycle_config(LifecycleConfigName=lifecycle_config['LifecycleConfigName'])
        for script in lifecycle_config_detail['OnStart']:
            if 'sudo' in script['Content']:
                print(f"Notebook Instance {notebook['NotebookInstanceName']} has root access enabled in lifecycle configuration.")
```

This script will print out the names of all SageMaker notebook instances that have root access enabled either directly or through their lifecycle configuration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Sagemaker Notebook Instance having root access enabled in AWS, follow these steps using the AWS console:

1. **Access AWS Sagemaker Console**: Log in to your AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon Sagemaker service.

2. **Navigate to Notebook Instances**: In the Amazon Sagemaker console, click on "Notebook instances" from the left-hand menu.

3. **Select the Sagemaker Notebook Instance**: Identify the Notebook Instance that has root access enabled and click on its name to access its details.

4. **Update the IAM Role**: Scroll down to the "Permissions and encryption" section and click on the IAM role link associated with the Notebook Instance.

5. **Edit IAM Role**: In the IAM console, click on "Attach policies" to attach a new policy to the IAM role.

6. **Attach a Policy**: Search for and attach the policy named "AmazonSageMakerFullAccess" to the IAM role. This policy provides full access to Amazon SageMaker resources without granting root access.

7. **Review and Save Changes**: Review the changes and click on "Attach policy" to save the changes.

8. **Verify Root Access**: Go back to the Notebook Instance details page and confirm that root access is no longer enabled for the instance.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of root access being enabled for the Sagemaker Notebook Instance in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Sagemaker Notebook Instance having Root Access enabled in AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. **List the Sagemaker Notebook Instances:**
   Run the following AWS CLI command to list all the Sagemaker Notebook Instances in your AWS account:
   ```
   aws sagemaker list-notebook-instances
   ```

2. **Identify the Notebook Instance with Root Access Enabled:**
   Look for the Notebook Instance that has Root Access enabled in the output of the above command. Note down the `NotebookInstanceName` of the instance.

3. **Update the IAM Role attached to the Notebook Instance:**
   Run the following AWS CLI command to update the IAM role attached to the Notebook Instance to remove Root Access:
   ```
   aws sagemaker update-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <NotebookInstanceName> --iam-role-arn <UpdatedIAMRoleARN>
   ```
   Replace `<NotebookInstanceName>` with the actual name of the Notebook Instance and `<UpdatedIAMRoleARN>` with the ARN of the IAM role that does not have Root Access.

4. **Verify the Changes:**
   Run the following AWS CLI command to describe the Notebook Instance and verify that Root Access has been disabled:
   ```
   aws sagemaker describe-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <NotebookInstanceName>
   ```
   Ensure that the `RootAccess` parameter is set to `Disabled`.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of Sagemaker Notebook Instance having Root Access enabled in AWS.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of having root access enabled on an AWS SageMaker Notebook Instance, you can follow these steps:

1. **Access the AWS Management Console:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com.

2. **Navigate to SageMaker Service:**
   Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page and select "Amazon SageMaker" under the "Machine Learning" category.

3. **Select the Notebook Instance:**
   In the Amazon SageMaker dashboard, click on "Notebook instances" from the left-hand side menu. Select the notebook instance that you want to remediate.

4. **Update the IAM Role:**
   Click on the notebook instance name to view its details. Scroll down to the "Permissions and encryption" section and locate the IAM role attached to the notebook instance.

5. **Modify the IAM Role Policy:**
   Click on the IAM role ARN to navigate to the IAM console. Locate the policy attached to the IAM role that grants root access and edit it.

6. **Revoke Root Access:**
   In the policy document, find the permissions that grant root access and remove or restrict them. Ensure that the IAM role only has the necessary permissions required for the SageMaker Notebook Instance to function properly.

7. **Review and Save Changes:**
   Review the policy changes to ensure that root access is no longer allowed. Once you are satisfied with the modifications, save the policy.

8. **Verify Changes:**
   Go back to the Amazon SageMaker console and refresh the page to ensure that the IAM role updates have been applied to the notebook instance.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having root access enabled on an AWS SageMaker Notebook Instance and ensure that the instance is securely configured.
