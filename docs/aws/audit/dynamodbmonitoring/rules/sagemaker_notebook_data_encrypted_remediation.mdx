### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Notebook Data Encrypted" misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the Amazon SageMaker service.

3. Click on the "Notebook instances" option from the left-hand menu.

4. Select the notebook instance that you want to remediate.

5. Click on the "Encryption" tab.

6. Ensure that "Encrypt root volume" is selected.

7. Choose the KMS key that you want to use for encryption.

8. Click on the "Update" button to save the changes.

9. Wait for the encryption process to complete.

By following these steps, you will have successfully remediated the "Notebook Data Encrypted" misconfiguration in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Notebook Data Encrypted" misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt and ensure that you have AWS CLI installed and configured with the appropriate AWS account credentials.

2. Run the following command to list all the Amazon SageMaker notebooks in your AWS account:
```
aws sagemaker list-notebook-instances
```

3. Identify the notebook instance that has the misconfiguration and make note of its name.

4. Run the following command to update the notebook instance with encryption enabled:
```
aws sagemaker update-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <notebook-instance-name> --default-code-repository <code-repo-arn> --instance-type <instance-type> --role-arn <role-arn> --volume-size-in-gb <volume-size> --accelerator-types <accelerator-type> --encryption-enabled
```
In the above command, replace the following placeholders with appropriate values:
- `<notebook-instance-name>`: The name of the notebook instance that you identified in step 3.
- `<code-repo-arn>`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the default code repository associated with the notebook instance.
- `<instance-type>`: The type of Amazon SageMaker notebook instance to use.
- `<role-arn>`: The ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon SageMaker assumes to perform tasks on your behalf.
- `<volume-size>`: The size, in GB, of the ML storage volume to attach to the notebook instance.
- `<accelerator-type>`: The type of Elastic Inference accelerator to associate with the notebook instance.

5. After running the above command, the notebook instance will be updated with encryption enabled. You can verify this by running the following command:
```
aws sagemaker describe-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name <notebook-instance-name> | grep EncryptionEnabled
```
If the output of this command shows "EncryptionEnabled": true, then the notebook instance has been successfully remediated for the "Notebook Data Encrypted" misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Notebook Data Encrypted" misconfiguration in AWS using python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine.

Step 2: Create a Python script to check if the Notebook data is encrypted or not.

```
import boto3

# Create a client for Amazon SageMaker
client = boto3.client('sagemaker')

# Get the list of all the notebooks
notebook_instances = client.list_notebook_instances()

# Iterate through all the notebooks
for notebook in notebook_instances['NotebookInstances']:
    # Check if the notebook instance is encrypted or not
    if notebook['KmsKeyId'] == '':
        # If not encrypted, update the notebook instance to encrypt the data
        client.update_notebook_instance(
            NotebookInstanceName=notebook['NotebookInstanceName'],
            DefaultCodeRepository=notebook['DefaultCodeRepository'],
            InstanceType=notebook['InstanceType'],
            RoleArn=notebook['RoleArn'],
            SubnetId=notebook['SubnetId'],
            SecurityGroupIds=notebook['SecurityGroupIds'],
            KmsKeyId='alias/aws/sagemaker'
        )
        print('Notebook instance {} is now encrypted.'.format(notebook['NotebookInstanceName']))
    else:
        print('Notebook instance {} is already encrypted.'.format(notebook['NotebookInstanceName']))
```

Step 3: Run the Python script to check if the Notebook data is encrypted or not. If not encrypted, update the Notebook instance to encrypt the data.

The above Python script will check if the Notebook data is encrypted or not. If it is not encrypted, it will update the Notebook instance to encrypt the data using the KMS key "alias/aws/sagemaker".

Note: Before running the script, make sure you have the necessary permissions to update the Notebook instance.
