### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent unencrypted data in DynamoDB notebooks using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Encryption at Rest:**
   - Navigate to the DynamoDB service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Select the table you want to encrypt.
   - Go to the "Overview" tab and check the "Encryption at rest" section.
   - Ensure that encryption is enabled. If not, create a new table with encryption enabled, as encryption cannot be enabled on an existing table.

2. **Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS):**
   - In the AWS Management Console, go to the KMS service.
   - Create a new Customer Master Key (CMK) if you don't already have one.
   - When creating or configuring your DynamoDB table, select the CMK you created to use for encryption.

3. **IAM Policies and Roles:**
   - Ensure that IAM policies and roles are configured to enforce encryption.
   - Navigate to the IAM service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Attach policies to users, groups, or roles that enforce the use of encrypted tables and restrict access to unencrypted tables.

4. **Enable CloudTrail and Config Rules:**
   - Go to the CloudTrail service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Ensure that CloudTrail is enabled to log all DynamoDB API calls.
   - Navigate to AWS Config and create a rule to check for unencrypted DynamoDB tables.
   - Set up notifications or automated remediation actions if an unencrypted table is detected.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your DynamoDB data is encrypted and secure.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent misconfigurations related to ensuring that data in DynamoDB is encrypted using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a DynamoDB Table with Encryption Enabled:**
   When creating a new DynamoDB table, you can specify the encryption settings. By default, DynamoDB tables are encrypted at rest using an AWS owned key. However, you can specify a customer-managed key (CMK) if needed.

   ```sh
   aws dynamodb create-table \
       --table-name MyTable \
       --attribute-definitions AttributeName=Id,AttributeType=S \
       --key-schema AttributeName=Id,KeyType=HASH \
       --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5 \
       --sse-specification Enabled=true,SSEType=KMS,KMSMasterKeyId=alias/my-key
   ```

2. **Enable Encryption on an Existing Table:**
   If you have an existing table and you want to enable encryption, you can update the table to use server-side encryption (SSE) with a customer-managed key.

   ```sh
   aws dynamodb update-table \
       --table-name MyTable \
       --sse-specification Enabled=true,SSEType=KMS,KMSMasterKeyId=alias/my-key
   ```

3. **Verify Encryption Settings:**
   To ensure that your DynamoDB table is encrypted, you can describe the table and check the SSEDescription.

   ```sh
   aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name MyTable
   ```

   Look for the `SSEDescription` in the output to verify that encryption is enabled and using the correct key.

4. **Set Default Encryption for New Tables:**
   While DynamoDB does not have a direct setting to enforce encryption by default for all new tables, you can create an AWS Config rule to ensure that all DynamoDB tables are encrypted. This is more of a monitoring step, but it helps in maintaining compliance.

   ```sh
   aws configservice put-config-rule \
       --config-rule file://dynamodb-encryption-rule.json
   ```

   Example `dynamodb-encryption-rule.json`:
   ```json
   {
       "ConfigRuleName": "dynamodb-encryption-check",
       "Description": "Check whether DynamoDB tables are encrypted",
       "Scope": {
           "ComplianceResourceTypes": [
               "AWS::DynamoDB::Table"
           ]
       },
       "Source": {
           "Owner": "AWS",
           "SourceIdentifier": "DYNAMODB_TABLE_ENCRYPTED"
       }
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your DynamoDB tables are encrypted, thereby preventing misconfigurations related to unencrypted data.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the DynamoDB service by typing 'DynamoDB' in the search bar and selecting it from the dropdown menu.
3. In the navigation pane on the left, click on 'Tables'.
4. Select the name of the table you want to check for encryption.
5. In the 'Overview' tab, scroll down to the 'Table details' section. Here, you can see the 'Encryption' field. If it says 'Enabled', then the data in the DynamoDB table is encrypted. If it says 'Disabled', then the data is not encrypted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. **List all DynamoDB Tables**: Use the AWS CLI command `aws dynamodb list-tables --region your-region-name` to list all the DynamoDB tables in your specified AWS region. Replace 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region.

3. **Describe DynamoDB Table**: For each table listed in the previous step, use the AWS CLI command `aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name your-table-name --region your-region-name` to get the details of each table. Replace 'your-table-name' with the name of your DynamoDB table and 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region.

4. **Check SSEDescription Status**: In the output of the describe-table command, look for the 'SSEDescription' field. If the 'Status' field under 'SSEDescription' is 'ENABLED', it means that the data at rest in the DynamoDB table is encrypted. If the 'Status' field is not present or is not set to 'ENABLED', it means that the data at rest in the DynamoDB table is not encrypted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS services. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials either by setting environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional), or by using the AWS CLI command `aws configure`.

2. Import the necessary libraries and create a DynamoDB resource object:
   You need to import Boto3 and create a DynamoDB resource object to interact with DynamoDB.
   ```python
   import boto3

   dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
   ```

3. Get the table description:
   You can get the description of the DynamoDB table, which includes information about the encryption settings, by using the `describe_table` method.
   ```python
   table = dynamodb.Table('your_table_name')
   response = table.meta.client.describe_table(TableName='your_table_name')
   ```

4. Check the encryption status:
   The `SSEDescription` field in the response contains information about the server-side encryption status. You can check if the `Status` field is `ENABLED` and the `SSEType` field is `KMS` to ensure that the data is encrypted.
   ```python
   encryption_status = response['Table']['SSEDescription']['Status']
   encryption_type = response['Table']['SSEDescription']['SSEType']

   if encryption_status == 'ENABLED' and encryption_type == 'KMS':
       print("Data is encrypted.")
   else:
       print("Data is not encrypted.")
   ```
   This script will print "Data is encrypted." if the data in the DynamoDB table is encrypted, and "Data is not encrypted." otherwise.
