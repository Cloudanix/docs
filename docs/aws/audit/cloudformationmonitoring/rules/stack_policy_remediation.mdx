### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent CloudFormation Stack Policy from not using a fail-safe mechanism in AWS CloudFormation using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to CloudFormation:**
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - In the Services menu, select "CloudFormation" under the "Management & Governance" section.

2. **Create or Update a Stack:**
   - Click on "Create stack" to create a new stack or select an existing stack and click "Update" to modify it.

3. **Specify Stack Policy:**
   - During the stack creation or update process, you will reach the "Configure stack options" step.
   - Scroll down to the "Stack policy" section.
   - Click on "Edit stack policy" to define or modify the stack policy.

4. **Implement Fail-Safe Mechanism:**
   - In the stack policy JSON, ensure you include a fail-safe mechanism. This typically involves specifying conditions that prevent critical resources from being unintentionally updated or deleted.
   - Example policy snippet:
     ```json
     {
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Deny",
           "Action": "Update:*",
           "Principal": "*",
           "Resource": "*",
           "Condition": {
             "StringEquals": {
               "aws:RequestTag/FailSafe": "true"
             }
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - This policy ensures that updates are denied unless a specific tag (`FailSafe=true`) is present in the request.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your CloudFormation stack policy includes a fail-safe mechanism to prevent unintended changes to critical resources.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent CloudFormation Stack Policy from not using a fail-safe mechanism using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Stack Policy JSON File:**
   First, create a JSON file that defines the stack policy with a fail-safe mechanism. This policy will restrict updates to critical resources unless explicitly allowed.

   ```json
   {
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Deny",
         "Action": "Update:*",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Resource": "*",
         "Condition": {
           "StringEquals": {
             "ResourceType": [
               "AWS::EC2::Instance",
               "AWS::RDS::DBInstance"
             ]
           }
         }
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "Update:*",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Create or Update the CloudFormation Stack with the Stack Policy:**
   Use the `aws cloudformation create-stack` or `aws cloudformation update-stack` command to create or update the stack with the stack policy.

   ```sh
   aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name my-stack --template-body file://my-template.json --stack-policy-body file://stack-policy.json
   ```

   Or, if updating an existing stack:

   ```sh
   aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name my-stack --template-body file://my-template.json --stack-policy-body file://stack-policy.json
   ```

3. **Set a Stack Policy on an Existing Stack:**
   If you need to set a stack policy on an existing stack without updating the stack itself, use the `set-stack-policy` command.

   ```sh
   aws cloudformation set-stack-policy --stack-name my-stack --stack-policy-body file://stack-policy.json
   ```

4. **Verify the Stack Policy:**
   To ensure that the stack policy has been applied correctly, you can describe the stack and check the stack policy.

   ```sh
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name my-stack
   ```

   Look for the `StackPolicyBody` in the output to verify that the policy has been applied.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your CloudFormation stack policy includes a fail-safe mechanism to prevent unintended updates to critical resources.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent CloudFormation Stack Policy from not using a fail-safe mechanism, you can use Python scripts to ensure that the stack policy includes a fail-safe mechanism. Here are the steps to achieve this:

### Step 1: Install Boto3
Ensure you have Boto3 installed, which is the AWS SDK for Python. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

### Step 2: Define the Stack Policy
Create a JSON object that defines the stack policy with a fail-safe mechanism. This policy will prevent updates to critical resources unless explicitly allowed.

```python
import json

stack_policy = {
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "Update:*",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:RequestTag/FailSafe": "true"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
stack_policy_json = json.dumps(stack_policy)
```

### Step 3: Create or Update the CloudFormation Stack with the Stack Policy
Use Boto3 to create or update the CloudFormation stack with the defined stack policy.

```python
import boto3

# Initialize a session using Amazon CloudFormation
client = boto3.client('cloudformation')

# Define the stack name and template URL or body
stack_name = 'your-stack-name'
template_url = 'https://path-to-your-template/template.yaml'

# Create or update the stack with the stack policy
response = client.create_stack(
    StackName=stack_name,
    TemplateURL=template_url,
    StackPolicyBody=stack_policy_json,
    Capabilities=[
        'CAPABILITY_IAM',  # Add other capabilities if needed
    ]
)

print(response)
```

### Step 4: Validate the Stack Policy
Ensure that the stack policy is correctly applied by describing the stack and checking the stack policy.

```python
# Describe the stack to validate the stack policy
response = client.describe_stacks(
    StackName=stack_name
)

# Print the stack policy
for stack in response['Stacks']:
    print(stack['StackPolicyBody'])
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your CloudFormation stack policy includes a fail-safe mechanism, preventing unauthorized updates to critical resources.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudFormation service.
2. In the CloudFormation console, select the "Stacks" option from the left-hand side menu.
3. Select the stack for which you want to check the policy. Click on the stack name to open its details.
4. In the stack details page, navigate to the "Stack Policy" tab. Here, you can view the policy associated with the stack. Check if the policy includes a fail-safe mechanism, such as a statement that denies all updates to all resources by default. If such a statement is not present, the stack policy is misconfigured.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the CloudFormation stacks.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the CloudFormation stacks in your account using the following command:
   ```
   aws cloudformation list-stacks --query 'StackSummaries[].StackName' --output text
   ```
   This command will return the names of all the CloudFormation stacks in your account.

3. Now, for each stack, you can get the stack policy using the following command:
   ```
   aws cloudformation get-stack-policy --stack-name <StackName>
   ```
   Replace `<StackName>` with the name of the stack you want to check. This command will return the stack policy in JSON format.

4. Finally, you need to manually check the returned policy. A fail-safe mechanism in a CloudFormation stack policy would typically include a statement that denies all actions on all resources by default, and then specifically allows certain actions on certain resources. If such a statement is not present in the policy, then the stack policy does not use a fail-safe mechanism.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You will need the boto3 library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. You can pass these credentials directly in your Python script (not recommended for security reasons) or configure them in your environment. The AWS CLI is an easy way to configure your environment:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. Write a Python script to list all CloudFormation stacks and their policies: Use the boto3 library to create a CloudFormation client and list all stacks. For each stack, get its policy and check if it uses a fail-safe mechanism. Here is a basic script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a CloudFormation client
   cf = boto3.client('cloudformation')

   # List all stacks
   stacks = cf.list_stacks(StackStatusFilter=['CREATE_COMPLETE', 'UPDATE_COMPLETE'])

   for stack in stacks['StackSummaries']:
       # Get stack policy
       try:
           policy = cf.get_stack_policy(StackName=stack['StackName'])
           policy_body = json.loads(policy['StackPolicyBody'])

           # Check if policy uses a fail-safe mechanism
           if 'Statement' in policy_body:
               for statement in policy_body['Statement']:
                   if statement['Effect'] == 'Deny' and 'NotResource' in statement:
                       print(f"Stack {stack['StackName']} uses a fail-safe mechanism")
                   else:
                       print(f"Stack {stack['StackName']} does not use a fail-safe mechanism")
           else:
               print(f"Stack {stack['StackName']} does not have a policy")

       except cf.exceptions.StackPolicyNotFoundException:
           print(f"Stack {stack['StackName']} does not have a policy")
   ```

4. Run the Python script: Save the script to a file, for example, check_stack_policy.py, and run it with Python:

   ```bash
   python check_stack_policy.py
   ```

This script will print the name of each stack and whether it uses a fail-safe mechanism in its policy. If a stack does not have a policy, it will also print that information.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudFormation Stack Policy Should Use A Fail-Safe Mechanism" in AWS using the AWS console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the CloudFormation service.
3. Click on the Stack for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.
4. Click on the "Permissions" tab.
5. Scroll down to the "Stack Policy" section.
6. Click on the "Edit" button.
7. Add the following statement to the policy:

```
{
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "Update:Delete",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "Null": {
            "aws:ResourceTag/aws:cloudformation:stack-name": "true"
        }
    }
}
```

This statement will deny any update that deletes a resource in the stack, unless the resource has a tag with the key "aws:cloudformation:stack-name" set to a non-null value.

8. Click on the "Save" button to save the updated Stack Policy.

By adding this statement to the Stack Policy, you have implemented a fail-safe mechanism that prevents accidental deletion of resources in the stack.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudFormation Stack Policy Should Use A Fail-Safe Mechanism" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or AWS CLI shell.

2. Run the following command to create a stack policy with a fail-safe mechanism:

```
aws cloudformation set-stack-policy --stack-name <stack-name> --stack-policy-body file://<path-to-policy-file>
```

Note: Replace `<stack-name>` with the name of the stack that you want to apply the policy to and `<path-to-policy-file>` with the path to the policy file on your local machine.

3. Verify that the stack policy has been set successfully by running the following command:

```
aws cloudformation get-stack-policy --stack-name <stack-name>
```

Note: Replace `<stack-name>` with the name of the stack that you applied the policy to.

4. If the output of the above command shows the policy that you set, then the remediation is successful.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "CloudFormation Stack Policy Should Use A Fail-Safe Mechanism" in AWS using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudFormation Stack Policy Should Use A Fail-Safe Mechanism" in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using the following command:
```
pip install boto3
```

2. Use the following Python code to remediate the misconfiguration:
```python
import boto3

# Create a CloudFormation client
client = boto3.client('cloudformation')

# Get the stack policy for the specified stack
stack_policy = client.get_stack_policy(StackName='STACK_NAME')['StackPolicyBody']

# Check if the stack policy has a fail-safe mechanism
if 'Statement' in stack_policy:
    for statement in stack_policy['Statement']:
        if 'Effect' in statement and statement['Effect'] == 'Deny' and 'Action' in statement and statement['Action'] == '*':
            # If a deny statement with action "*" is found, remove it
            stack_policy['Statement'].remove(statement)

# Update the stack policy with the new policy
client.set_stack_policy(StackName='STACK_NAME', StackPolicyBody=stack_policy)
```

Replace `STACK_NAME` with the name of the stack for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

This code will retrieve the stack policy for the specified stack, check if it contains a fail-safe mechanism (a deny statement with action "*"), and remove it if found. Finally, it will update the stack policy with the new policy that includes the fail-safe mechanism.
