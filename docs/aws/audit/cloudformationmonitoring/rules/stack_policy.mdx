### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudFormation service.
2. In the CloudFormation console, select the "Stacks" option from the left-hand side menu.
3. Select the stack for which you want to check the policy. Click on the stack name to open its details.
4. In the stack details page, navigate to the "Stack Policy" tab. Here, you can view the policy associated with the stack. Check if the policy includes a fail-safe mechanism, such as a statement that denies all updates to all resources by default. If such a statement is not present, the stack policy is misconfigured.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the CloudFormation stacks.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the CloudFormation stacks in your account using the following command:
   ```
   aws cloudformation list-stacks --query 'StackSummaries[].StackName' --output text
   ```
   This command will return the names of all the CloudFormation stacks in your account.

3. Now, for each stack, you can get the stack policy using the following command:
   ```
   aws cloudformation get-stack-policy --stack-name <StackName>
   ```
   Replace `<StackName>` with the name of the stack you want to check. This command will return the stack policy in JSON format.

4. Finally, you need to manually check the returned policy. A fail-safe mechanism in a CloudFormation stack policy would typically include a statement that denies all actions on all resources by default, and then specifically allows certain actions on certain resources. If such a statement is not present in the policy, then the stack policy does not use a fail-safe mechanism.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You will need the boto3 library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. You can pass these credentials directly in your Python script (not recommended for security reasons) or configure them in your environment. The AWS CLI is an easy way to configure your environment:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. Write a Python script to list all CloudFormation stacks and their policies: Use the boto3 library to create a CloudFormation client and list all stacks. For each stack, get its policy and check if it uses a fail-safe mechanism. Here is a basic script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a CloudFormation client
   cf = boto3.client('cloudformation')

   # List all stacks
   stacks = cf.list_stacks(StackStatusFilter=['CREATE_COMPLETE', 'UPDATE_COMPLETE'])

   for stack in stacks['StackSummaries']:
       # Get stack policy
       try:
           policy = cf.get_stack_policy(StackName=stack['StackName'])
           policy_body = json.loads(policy['StackPolicyBody'])

           # Check if policy uses a fail-safe mechanism
           if 'Statement' in policy_body:
               for statement in policy_body['Statement']:
                   if statement['Effect'] == 'Deny' and 'NotResource' in statement:
                       print(f"Stack {stack['StackName']} uses a fail-safe mechanism")
                   else:
                       print(f"Stack {stack['StackName']} does not use a fail-safe mechanism")
           else:
               print(f"Stack {stack['StackName']} does not have a policy")

       except cf.exceptions.StackPolicyNotFoundException:
           print(f"Stack {stack['StackName']} does not have a policy")
   ```

4. Run the Python script: Save the script to a file, for example, check_stack_policy.py, and run it with Python:

   ```bash
   python check_stack_policy.py
   ```

This script will print the name of each stack and whether it uses a fail-safe mechanism in its policy. If a stack does not have a policy, it will also print that information.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudFormation Stack Policy Should Use A Fail-Safe Mechanism" in AWS using the AWS console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the CloudFormation service.
3. Click on the Stack for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.
4. Click on the "Permissions" tab.
5. Scroll down to the "Stack Policy" section.
6. Click on the "Edit" button.
7. Add the following statement to the policy:

```
{
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "Update:Delete",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "Null": {
            "aws:ResourceTag/aws:cloudformation:stack-name": "true"
        }
    }
}
```

This statement will deny any update that deletes a resource in the stack, unless the resource has a tag with the key "aws:cloudformation:stack-name" set to a non-null value.

8. Click on the "Save" button to save the updated Stack Policy.

By adding this statement to the Stack Policy, you have implemented a fail-safe mechanism that prevents accidental deletion of resources in the stack.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudFormation Stack Policy Should Use A Fail-Safe Mechanism" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or AWS CLI shell.

2. Run the following command to create a stack policy with a fail-safe mechanism:

```
aws cloudformation set-stack-policy --stack-name <stack-name> --stack-policy-body file://<path-to-policy-file>
```

Note: Replace `<stack-name>` with the name of the stack that you want to apply the policy to and `<path-to-policy-file>` with the path to the policy file on your local machine.

3. Verify that the stack policy has been set successfully by running the following command:

```
aws cloudformation get-stack-policy --stack-name <stack-name>
```

Note: Replace `<stack-name>` with the name of the stack that you applied the policy to.

4. If the output of the above command shows the policy that you set, then the remediation is successful.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "CloudFormation Stack Policy Should Use A Fail-Safe Mechanism" in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudFormation Stack Policy Should Use A Fail-Safe Mechanism" in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using the following command:
```
pip install boto3
```

2. Use the following Python code to remediate the misconfiguration:
```python
import boto3

# Create a CloudFormation client
client = boto3.client('cloudformation')

# Get the stack policy for the specified stack
stack_policy = client.get_stack_policy(StackName='STACK_NAME')['StackPolicyBody']

# Check if the stack policy has a fail-safe mechanism
if 'Statement' in stack_policy:
    for statement in stack_policy['Statement']:
        if 'Effect' in statement and statement['Effect'] == 'Deny' and 'Action' in statement and statement['Action'] == '*':
            # If a deny statement with action "*" is found, remove it
            stack_policy['Statement'].remove(statement)

# Update the stack policy with the new policy
client.set_stack_policy(StackName='STACK_NAME', StackPolicyBody=stack_policy)
```

Replace `STACK_NAME` with the name of the stack for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

This code will retrieve the stack policy for the specified stack, check if it contains a fail-safe mechanism (a deny statement with action "*"), and remove it if found. Finally, it will update the stack policy with the new policy that includes the fail-safe mechanism.
