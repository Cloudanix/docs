### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent AWS CloudFormation Drift Detection issues using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Regularly Perform Drift Detection:**
   - Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console.
   - Select the stack you want to monitor.
   - Click on the "Actions" dropdown and select "Detect drift."
   - Regularly performing drift detection helps you identify and address configuration changes that were made outside of CloudFormation.

2. **Enable Stack Policy:**
   - While creating or updating a stack, you can set a stack policy to protect critical resources from being unintentionally updated.
   - In the CloudFormation console, during the stack creation or update process, go to the "Configure stack options" step.
   - Under "Stack policy," you can define a JSON policy that specifies which resources can be updated and which cannot.

3. **Use Change Sets:**
   - Before making changes to your stack, create a change set to preview the changes.
   - In the CloudFormation console, select your stack, click on "Actions," and then "Create change set."
   - Review the proposed changes to ensure they align with your expectations and do not introduce unintended drift.

4. **Implement Resource Import:**
   - If you have resources that were created outside of CloudFormation, import them into your CloudFormation stack.
   - In the CloudFormation console, select your stack, click on "Actions," and then "Import resources into stack."
   - Follow the prompts to import the resources, ensuring they are managed by CloudFormation and reducing the risk of drift.

By following these steps, you can proactively manage and prevent drift in your AWS CloudFormation stacks using the AWS Management Console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent AWS CloudFormation Drift Detection issues using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Use Stack Policies:**
   - Stack policies help protect critical resources from being unintentionally updated during stack updates.
   - Create a stack policy JSON file (e.g., `stack-policy.json`):
     ```json
     {
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Deny",
           "Action": "Update:*",
           "Principal": "*",
           "Resource": "*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Apply the stack policy when creating or updating a stack:
     ```sh
     aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name my-stack --template-body file://template.json --stack-policy-body file://stack-policy.json
     ```
     or
     ```sh
     aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name my-stack --template-body file://template.json --stack-policy-body file://stack-policy.json
     ```

2. **Enable Termination Protection:**
   - Termination protection prevents stacks from being accidentally deleted.
   - Enable termination protection when creating a stack:
     ```sh
     aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name my-stack --template-body file://template.json --enable-termination-protection
     ```
   - Enable termination protection for an existing stack:
     ```sh
     aws cloudformation update-termination-protection --stack-name my-stack --enable-termination-protection
     ```

3. **Use Change Sets:**
   - Change sets allow you to preview the changes AWS CloudFormation will make to your stack, helping you avoid unintended changes.
   - Create a change set:
     ```sh
     aws cloudformation create-change-set --stack-name my-stack --template-body file://template.json --change-set-name my-change-set
     ```
   - Describe the change set to review changes:
     ```sh
     aws cloudformation describe-change-set --change-set-name my-change-set --stack-name my-stack
     ```
   - Execute the change set after review:
     ```sh
     aws cloudformation execute-change-set --change-set-name my-change-set --stack-name my-stack
     ```

4. **Regularly Detect and Monitor Drift:**
   - Regularly detect drift to ensure that stack resources remain consistent with the stack template.
   - Detect drift on a stack:
     ```sh
     aws cloudformation detect-stack-drift --stack-name my-stack
     ```
   - Describe the drift detection results:
     ```sh
     aws cloudformation describe-stack-drift-detection-status --stack-drift-detection-id <drift-detection-id>
     ```

By following these steps, you can help prevent misconfigurations and ensure that your AWS CloudFormation stacks remain consistent with their templates.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
Preventing AWS CloudFormation Drift Detection involves ensuring that the stack's resources remain consistent with the stack's template. Here are four steps to help prevent drift using Python scripts:

### 1. **Automate Stack Updates with Boto3**

Ensure that all updates to your CloudFormation stacks are automated through scripts to maintain consistency. Use the Boto3 library to update stacks programmatically.

```python
import boto3

def update_stack(stack_name, template_body, parameters):
    client = boto3.client('cloudformation')
    response = client.update_stack(
        StackName=stack_name,
        TemplateBody=template_body,
        Parameters=parameters,
        Capabilities=['CAPABILITY_IAM', 'CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM']
    )
    return response

# Example usage
stack_name = 'my-stack'
template_body = open('template.json').read()
parameters = [
    {
        'ParameterKey': 'InstanceType',
        'ParameterValue': 't2.micro'
    }
]

update_stack(stack_name, template_body, parameters)
```

### 2. **Implement Stack Policy**

Use stack policies to prevent unauthorized updates to critical resources. This can be done programmatically using Boto3.

```python
import boto3

def set_stack_policy(stack_name, stack_policy_body):
    client = boto3.client('cloudformation')
    response = client.set_stack_policy(
        StackName=stack_name,
        StackPolicyBody=stack_policy_body
    )
    return response

# Example usage
stack_name = 'my-stack'
stack_policy_body = open('stack-policy.json').read()

set_stack_policy(stack_name, stack_policy_body)
```

### 3. **Regularly Validate Templates**

Regularly validate your CloudFormation templates to ensure they are correct and up-to-date. This can be done using the `validate_template` method in Boto3.

```python
import boto3

def validate_template(template_body):
    client = boto3.client('cloudformation')
    response = client.validate_template(
        TemplateBody=template_body
    )
    return response

# Example usage
template_body = open('template.json').read()
validate_template(template_body)
```

### 4. **Monitor Stack Events**

Set up monitoring for stack events to detect any unexpected changes. This can be done using CloudWatch Events and Lambda functions, but you can also use Boto3 to fetch stack events.

```python
import boto3

def get_stack_events(stack_name):
    client = boto3.client('cloudformation')
    response = client.describe_stack_events(
        StackName=stack_name
    )
    return response['StackEvents']

# Example usage
stack_name = 'my-stack'
events = get_stack_events(stack_name)
for event in events:
    print(event)
```

By following these steps, you can help prevent drift in your AWS CloudFormation stacks using Python scripts.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS CloudFormation console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Stacks".

3. Select the stack that you want to check for drift. 

4. On the stack details page, choose the "Drift" tab. Here, you can see the drift status of your stack. If the stack has never been checked for drift, the drift status is "Not checked". If resources in the stack have drifted, the drift status is "Drifted". If no resources have drifted, the drift status is "In sync".
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can use AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can install AWS CLI by following the instructions on the official AWS CLI User Guide. After installation, you can configure it by running `aws configure` command and providing your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List the stacks: Use the `describe-stacks` command to list all the stacks in your AWS account. The command is as follows:
   ```
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the stacks.

3. Detect drift on a stack: Use the `detect-stack-drift` command to detect if there is any drift in the stack. Replace `StackName` with the name of your stack. The command is as follows:
   ```
   aws cloudformation detect-stack-drift --stack-name StackName
   ```
   This command will return a Drift Detection ID that you can use to check the status of the drift detection operation.

4. Check drift detection status: Use the `describe-stack-drift-detection-status` command to check the status of the drift detection operation. Replace `DriftDetectionId` with the ID you got from the previous step. The command is as follows:
   ```
   aws cloudformation describe-stack-drift-detection-status --stack-drift-detection-id DriftDetectionId
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with the status of the drift detection operation. If the status is `DETECTION_COMPLETE`, it means the drift detection operation is complete and you can check the results.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Set up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):** First, you need to set up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) on your local machine. This will allow you to interact with AWS services using Python. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:** Next, you need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a file at ~/.aws/credentials. At the command line, type:

```python
aws configure
```

Then follow the prompts to input your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

3. **Create a Python Script to Detect Drift:** Now, you can create a Python script that uses Boto3 to detect drift in your AWS CloudFormation stacks. Here's a basic example:

```python
import boto3

# Create a client
client = boto3.client('cloudformation')

# Detect drift in a stack
response = client.detect_stack_drift(
    StackName='MyStack'
)

print(response)
```

This script creates a CloudFormation client, then uses the `detect_stack_drift` method to detect drift in a stack named 'MyStack'. The response from AWS will be printed to the console.

4. **Interpret the Response:** The response from AWS will include a `StackDriftStatus` field, which will tell you whether the stack has drifted from its expected configuration. The possible values are `DRIFTED`, `NOT_CHECKED`, `IN_SYNC`, or `UNKNOWN`. If the status is `DRIFTED`, it means that one or more of the stack's resources have drifted.

Remember to replace 'MyStack' with the name of your actual stack. Also, this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to detect drift in the specified stack.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
AWS CloudFormation Drift Detection is a feature that helps you identify resources that have drifted away from their expected configurations. Once you have identified the resources that have drifted, you can use the AWS CLI to remediate the drift.

Here are the steps to remediate AWS CloudFormation Drift Detection using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the stack that has drifted by running the following command:

```
aws cloudformation detect-stack-drift --stack-name <stack-name>
```

2. Once you have identified the resources that have drifted, you can generate a drift report by running the following command:

```
aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource-drifts --stack-name <stack-name>
```

3. Review the drift report to identify the resources that have drifted and the expected and actual configurations.

4. To remediate the drift, update the stack with the expected configuration by running the following command:

```
aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name <stack-name> --template-body file://<path-to-template> --parameters file://<path-to-parameters>
```

Replace `<path-to-template>` and `<path-to-parameters>` with the file paths to the updated CloudFormation template and parameters file.

5. Wait for the stack update to complete by running the following command:

```
aws cloudformation wait stack-update-complete --stack-name <stack-name>
```

6. Verify that the stack has been remediated by running the following command:

```
aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources --stack-name <stack-name>
```

This will show you the current configuration of the resources in the stack. If the resources have been remediated, the expected and actual configurations should match.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate AWS CloudFormation drift detection using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the required libraries: boto3, json

```python
import boto3
import json
```

2. Create a boto3 client for AWS CloudFormation:

```python
client = boto3.client('cloudformation')
```

3. Get the list of stacks:

```python
stacks = client.list_stacks(StackStatusFilter=['CREATE_COMPLETE', 'UPDATE_COMPLETE'])['StackSummaries']
```

4. Loop through the stacks and check for drift:

```python
for stack in stacks:
    stack_drift = client.detect_stack_drift(StackName=stack['StackName'])
    if stack_drift['StackDriftStatus'] == 'DRIFTED':
        print('Stack {} has drifted'.format(stack['StackName']))
```

5. If a stack has drifted, remediate it by updating the stack:

```python
response = client.update_stack(StackName=stack['StackName'], UsePreviousTemplate=True)
print('Stack {} has been remediated'.format(stack['StackName']))
```

Note: Make sure to test the script thoroughly before running it in a production environment.
