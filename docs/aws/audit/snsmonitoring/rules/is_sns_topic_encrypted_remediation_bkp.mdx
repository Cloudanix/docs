How to enable Server-Side Encryption (SSE) for your Amazon SNS topics?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the SNS service by selecting "SNS" from the services menu.
3. In the SNS dashboard, click on "Topics" in the left navigation pane.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "SNS Topics Should Be Encrypted" Policy.)
4. Select the SNS topic for which you want to enable server-side encryption by clicking on its name.
5. In the topic details page, click on the "Edit" button.
6. Scroll down to the "Server-side encryption" section.
7. Select the encryption option you want to enable. You have two options:
   - "Enable AWS managed CMK" to use an AWS managed customer master key (CMK) for encryption. Select this option if you want AWS to manage the encryption keys for you.
   - "Enable customer managed CMK" to use a customer managed CMK for encryption. Select this option if you want to have more control over the encryption keys.
8. If you selected the "Enable customer managed CMK" option, choose the customer managed CMK from the dropdown menu.
9. Click on the "Save changes" button to apply the encryption settings to the SNS topic.
10. The server-side encryption will be enabled for the SNS topic, and any messages published to the topic will be encrypted using the specified encryption key.
11. Test the encryption by publishing a message to the topic and verifying that it is encrypted when received by subscribers.
12. Repeat these steps for any other SNS topics that you want to enable server-side encryption for.
