### Remediation

How to implement the required permissions to secure any exposed SNS topics?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using an account with administrative privileges.
2. Open the Amazon SNS console by navigating to the SNS service.
3. Select the exposed SNS topic for which you want to implement permissions.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "SNS Topics Should Not Be Exposed" Policy.)
4. In the topic details page, click on the "Edit" button.
5. Scroll down to the "Access policy" section and click on the "Advanced security settings" link.
6. In the advanced security settings, you can configure the required permissions to secure the exposed SNS topic. The following are some steps you can take:
   - Restrict access to specific AWS accounts: Modify the existing access policy or create a new access policy that allows access only to specific AWS accounts. Remove any wildcard or public access permissions and specify the specific AWS accounts that should have access to the topic.
   - Implement IAM user or role-based access control: Modify the access policy to grant permissions only to specific IAM users or roles. Remove any overly permissive access permissions and grant access only to the necessary users or roles.
   - Enable cross-account access with explicit permissions: If you need to allow access to the topic from another AWS account, use the "AWS account ID" condition in the access policy to specify the allowed accounts explicitly.
   - Restrict access based on IP addresses: If you want to limit access to the topic from specific IP addresses or CIDR blocks, you can modify the access policy to include the "aws:SourceIp" condition.
7. Once you have made the necessary changes to the access policy, click on the "Save changes" button to apply the new permissions.
