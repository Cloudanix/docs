### Remediation

How to implement the required permissions to secure the exposed SNS topics?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using an account with administrative privileges.
2. Open the SNS (Simple Notification Service) console by navigating to the SNS service.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "SNS Topics Should Not Allow Global Publishing" Policy.)
3. Select the SNS topic that you want to secure or create a new topic.
4. In the topic details page, click on the "Access policy" tab.
5. Click on the "Edit" button to modify the access policy for the topic.
6. In the access policy editor, you can define the required permissions to secure the topic. Here are some common permissions you may want to consider:
   - Limit access to specific AWS accounts: Add "Principal" elements specifying the AWS account IDs that are allowed to publish or subscribe to the topic. For example:
   
     ```json
     "Principal": {
       "AWS": [
         "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root",
         "arn:aws:iam::987654321098:user/my-user"
       ]
     }
     ```

   - Restrict access by IP address or CIDR range: Add "Condition" elements with the "IpAddress" or "SourceIp" condition key. For example:
   
     ```json
     "Condition": {
       "IpAddress": {
         "aws:SourceIp": "192.0.2.0/24"
       }
     }
     ```

   - Allow specific actions: Use the "Action" element to specify the allowed actions. For example, to only allow publishing messages, use:
   
     ```json
     "Action": [
       "sns:Publish"
     ]
     ```

   - Deny access to other accounts or entities: Add a "Deny" statement to explicitly deny access to certain AWS accounts or entities. For example:
   
     ```json
     "Effect": "Deny",
     "Principal": {
       "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::987654321098:user/other-user"
     },
     "Action": [
       "sns:Publish"
     ]
     ```
7. Once you have defined the required permissions in the access policy, click on the "Save changes" button to apply the policy.
