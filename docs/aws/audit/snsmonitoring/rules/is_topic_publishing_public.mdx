### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon SNS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home.

2. In the navigation pane, choose 'Topics'. This will display a list of all the SNS topics in your account.

3. Select the SNS topic you want to check. In the 'Details' section, look for the 'Access policy' field.

4. In the 'Access policy' field, check if the 'Principal' is set to '*'. If it is, this means the SNS topic allows global publishing.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the SNS topics.

2. Once the AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can list all the SNS topics in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws sns list-topics
   ```
   This command will return a list of all SNS topics in your account.

3. For each SNS topic, you can get the topic attributes which include the policy by running the following command:

   ```
   aws sns get-topic-attributes --topic-arn <TopicARN>
   ```
   Replace `<TopicARN>` with the ARN of the topic you want to check. This command will return the attributes of the specified SNS topic.

4. To check if the SNS topic allows global publishing, you need to look at the `Policy` attribute in the output of the previous command. If the `Policy` attribute contains a statement with `"Effect": "Allow"` and `"Principal": "*"`, it means the SNS topic allows global publishing. You can use a tool like `jq` to parse the JSON output and check for these values.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can configure credentials by using the AWS CLI or by directly inserting your access keys into the script (not recommended for security reasons).

```python
import boto3

aws_access_key_id = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'
aws_secret_access_key = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id,
    aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key
)
```

3. Write the Python script: Now you can write a Python script that checks if SNS Topics allow global publishing. The script will use the `list_topics` method to get all the SNS topics and then use the `get_topic_attributes` method to get the policy of each topic. If the policy allows global publishing, the script will print a warning message.

```python
sns = session.client('sns')

response = sns.list_topics()

for topic in response['Topics']:
    attributes = sns.get_topic_attributes(TopicArn=topic['TopicArn'])
    policy = json.loads(attributes['Attributes']['Policy'])
    for statement in policy['Statement']:
        if statement['Principal'] == {'AWS': '*'} and statement['Action'] == 'SNS:Publish' and statement['Effect'] == 'Allow':
            print(f"Warning: The SNS topic {topic['TopicArn']} allows global publishing.")
```

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run the script. If there are any SNS topics that allow global publishing, you will see a warning message in the console. If there are no such topics, the script will not print anything.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the SNS topic global publishing misconfiguration in AWS:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the SNS service.
2. Click on the SNS topic that needs to be remediated.
3. In the topic details page, click on the "Access Policy" tab.
4. Click on the "Edit" button to modify the access policy.
5. In the access policy editor, remove the following statement:

```
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "SNS:Publish",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:*:*:*"
}
```

6. Click on the "Save Changes" button to save the updated access policy.
7. Verify that the access policy no longer allows global publishing by checking that the `Principal` is no longer set to `"*"`.
8. Repeat these steps for any other SNS topics that need to be remediated.

That's it! By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the SNS topic global publishing misconfiguration in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of SNS Topics allowing global publishing in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your system.

2. Run the following command to list all the SNS topics in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws sns list-topics
   ```

3. Identify the ARN of the SNS topic that needs to be remediated.

4. Run the following command to update the SNS topic policy to disallow global publishing:

   ```
   aws sns set-topic-attributes --topic-arn <topic-arn> --attribute-name Policy --attribute-value '{"Version":"2008-10-17","Id":"__default_policy_ID","Statement":[{"Effect":"Deny","Principal":"*","Action":"SNS:Publish","Resource":"<topic-arn>","Condition":{"StringEquals":{"AWS:SourceOwner":"<aws-account-id>"}}}]}'
   ```

   Replace `<topic-arn>` with the ARN of the SNS topic identified in step 3 and `<aws-account-id>` with your AWS account ID.

5. Verify that the SNS topic policy has been updated successfully by running the following command:

   ```
   aws sns get-topic-attributes --topic-arn <topic-arn> --attribute-names Policy
   ```

   This command should return the updated policy that disallows global publishing.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for all the SNS topics in your AWS account that allow global publishing.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of SNS topics allowing global publishing in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration in AWS where SNS Topics should not allow global publishing, you can follow the below steps using Python:

1. Create an AWS SNS client using the Boto3 library in Python.

```python
import boto3

sns_client = boto3.client('sns')
```

2. Get the list of all SNS topics using the `list_topics()` method.

```python
response = sns_client.list_topics()
topics = response['Topics']
```

3. For each topic, check if it has the `Policy` attribute set. If it does, retrieve the policy using the `get_topic_attributes()` method.

```python
for topic in topics:
    topic_arn = topic['TopicArn']
    response = sns_client.get_topic_attributes(TopicArn=topic_arn)
    policy = response.get('Attributes', {}).get('Policy')
```

4. If the policy exists, parse it using the `json` module and check if it allows global publishing. If it does, update the policy to disallow global publishing using the `set_topic_attributes()` method.

```python
import json

if policy:
    policy_json = json.loads(policy)
    if 'Statement' in policy_json:
        for statement in policy_json['Statement']:
            if (statement.get('Effect') == 'Allow' and 
                statement.get('Principal') == '*'):
                policy_json['Statement'].remove(statement)
        new_policy = json.dumps(policy_json)
        sns_client.set_topic_attributes(TopicArn=topic_arn, 
                                         AttributeName='Policy', 
                                         AttributeValue=new_policy)
```

5. Once all the policies have been updated, the misconfiguration has been remediated.

Note: Make sure to have the appropriate AWS credentials and permissions set up for the Python script to access and modify SNS topics.
