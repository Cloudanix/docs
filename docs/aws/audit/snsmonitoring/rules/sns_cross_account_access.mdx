How to update SNS topics policy to allow cross account access from trusted entities?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using an account with appropriate permissions.
2. Open the Amazon SNS console by navigating to the SNS service.
3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Topics" and select the topic for which you want to update the policy.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "SNS Topics Should Not Have Cross Account Access" Policy.)
4. In the topic details page, click on the "Edit topic policy" button.
5. In the policy editor, update the policy document to allow cross-account access from the trusted entity. The policy document should include the necessary statements to grant permissions to the trusted account or accounts.
   For example, you can use the following policy statement to allow cross-account access from a specific AWS account:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_ID:root"
         },
         "Action": "SNS:Publish",
         "Resource": "TOPIC_ARN"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Replace `TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_ID` with the AWS account ID of the trusted account, and `TOPIC_ARN` with the ARN of the SNS topic.
6. After updating the policy document, click on the "Update policy" button to save the changes.
