### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent SNS Topics from allowing global subscribe in AWS using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to SNS Dashboard:**
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - In the search bar, type "SNS" and select "Simple Notification Service" from the list of services.

2. **Select the SNS Topic:**
   - In the SNS dashboard, click on "Topics" in the left-hand navigation pane.
   - Find and select the SNS topic you want to configure.

3. **Edit Access Policy:**
   - Once you have selected the topic, click on the "Actions" button and choose "Edit topic policy."
   - Review the existing policy and ensure that it does not include a wildcard (`*`) for the `Principal` element in the `Subscribe` action. This wildcard allows any AWS account to subscribe to the topic.

4. **Restrict Access:**
   - Modify the policy to specify only the AWS accounts or IAM roles that should have permission to subscribe to the topic.
   - Save the changes by clicking the "Save changes" button.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your SNS topics do not allow global subscribe permissions, thereby enhancing the security of your AWS environment.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent SNS Topics from allowing global subscribe permissions using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **List SNS Topics**:
   First, identify the SNS topics in your AWS account.
   ```sh
   aws sns list-topics
   ```

2. **Get Topic Attributes**:
   For each SNS topic, retrieve the current access policy to review and modify it.
   ```sh
   aws sns get-topic-attributes --topic-arn <topic-arn>
   ```

3. **Modify the Access Policy**:
   Update the access policy to restrict global subscribe permissions. Create a JSON file (e.g., `sns-policy.json`) with the appropriate policy that restricts global access. Here is an example policy that denies global subscribe permissions:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Deny",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action": "SNS:Subscribe",
         "Resource": "<topic-arn>",
         "Condition": {
           "StringNotEquals": {
             "aws:PrincipalOrgID": "<your-org-id>"
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Set the Updated Policy**:
   Apply the updated policy to the SNS topic.
   ```sh
   aws sns set-topic-attributes --topic-arn <topic-arn> --attribute-name Policy --attribute-value file://sns-policy.json
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your SNS topics do not allow global subscribe permissions, thereby enhancing the security of your AWS environment.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent SNS Topics from allowing global subscribe permissions using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**:
   Initialize the Boto3 client for SNS. This will allow you to interact with the SNS service.
   ```python
   import boto3

   sns_client = boto3.client('sns')
   ```

3. **Retrieve SNS Topics**:
   Retrieve the list of SNS topics in your AWS account.
   ```python
   response = sns_client.list_topics()
   topics = response['Topics']
   ```

4. **Check and Update Topic Policies**:
   For each SNS topic, retrieve its policy, check for global subscribe permissions, and update the policy to remove such permissions if they exist.
   ```python
   import json

   for topic in topics:
       topic_arn = topic['TopicArn']
       
       # Get the current policy of the topic
       policy_response = sns_client.get_topic_attributes(TopicArn=topic_arn)
       policy = json.loads(policy_response['Attributes'].get('Policy', '{}'))
       
       # Check if the policy allows global subscribe
       statements = policy.get('Statement', [])
       for statement in statements:
           if statement.get('Effect') == 'Allow' and 'sns:Subscribe' in statement.get('Action', []):
               principal = statement.get('Principal', {})
               if principal == '*' or principal.get('AWS') == '*':
                   # Remove or modify the statement to prevent global subscribe
                   statements.remove(statement)
       
       # Update the policy if changes were made
       if statements != policy.get('Statement', []):
           policy['Statement'] = statements
           sns_client.set_topic_attributes(
               TopicArn=topic_arn,
               AttributeName='Policy',
               AttributeValue=json.dumps(policy)
           )
   ```

This script will ensure that no SNS topic in your AWS account allows global subscribe permissions by checking and updating the topic policies accordingly.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon SNS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Topics". This will display a list of all the SNS topics in your account.

3. Select the SNS topic you want to check. In the "Details" section, look for the "Access policy" field. This field contains the policy that determines who can publish messages to the topic and who can subscribe to the topic.

4. Check the "Principal" field in the policy. If it is set to "*", this means that the topic allows global subscribe, which is a misconfiguration. The "Principal" field should be set to specific AWS accounts or AWS services that need to publish or subscribe to the topic.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the SNS topics.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the SNS topics in your account using the following command:
   ```
   aws sns list-topics
   ```
   This command will return a list of all SNS topics in your account.

3. For each SNS topic, you can get the topic attributes using the following command:
   ```
   aws sns get-topic-attributes --topic-arn <TopicARN>
   ```
   Replace `<TopicARN>` with the ARN of the SNS topic. This command will return the attributes of the specified SNS topic.

4. Check the `Policy` attribute of each SNS topic. If the `Policy` attribute contains a statement with `"Effect": "Allow"` and `"Principal": "*"`, it means that the SNS topic allows global subscribe. This is a misconfiguration and should be fixed. You can use a Python script to automate this process. Here is a simple example:
   ```python
   import json
   import subprocess

   # Get the list of all SNS topics
   topics = json.loads(subprocess.check_output(['aws', 'sns', 'list-topics']))['Topics']

   for topic in topics:
       # Get the attributes of each SNS topic
       attributes = json.loads(subprocess.check_output(['aws', 'sns', 'get-topic-attributes', '--topic-arn', topic['TopicArn']]))['Attributes']
       
       # Check the policy of each SNS topic
       policy = json.loads(attributes['Policy'])
       for statement in policy['Statement']:
           if statement['Effect'] == 'Allow' and statement['Principal'] == '*':
               print(f"The SNS topic {topic['TopicArn']} allows global subscribe.")
   ```
   This script will print the ARNs of all SNS topics that allow global subscribe.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing Python scripts to interact with AWS, you need to install the necessary libraries. The primary library you need is boto3, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to interact with AWS services. You can set them up in your environment variables:

   ```python
   import os
   os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] = 'your_access_key'
   os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] = 'your_secret_access_key'
   ```

3. Write a Python script to list all SNS topics and their policies: You can use the `list_topics` method to get all SNS topics and then use the `get_topic_attributes` method to get the policy of each topic. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   sns = boto3.client('sns')

   # List all SNS topics
   response = sns.list_topics()
   topics = response['Topics']

   for topic in topics:
       # Get the policy of each topic
       topic_arn = topic['TopicArn']
       response = sns.get_topic_attributes(TopicArn=topic_arn)
       policy = response['Attributes']['Policy']
       print(f'Topic ARN: {topic_arn}\nPolicy: {policy}\n')
   ```

4. Analyze the policies: The policy of each SNS topic is a JSON string. You can convert it to a Python dictionary using the `json.loads` method and then check if it allows global subscribe. If the "Principal" in the policy is "*", it means the topic allows global subscribe. Here is how you can modify the above script to detect such topics:

   ```python
   import boto3
   import json

   sns = boto3.client('sns')

   # List all SNS topics
   response = sns.list_topics()
   topics = response['Topics']

   for topic in topics:
       # Get the policy of each topic
       topic_arn = topic['TopicArn']
       response = sns.get_topic_attributes(TopicArn=topic_arn)
       policy = json.loads(response['Attributes']['Policy'])

       # Check if the topic allows global subscribe
       for statement in policy['Statement']:
           if statement['Principal'] == '*':
               print(f'Topic ARN: {topic_arn} allows global subscribe\n')
   ```
This script will print the ARNs of all SNS topics that allow global subscribe.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Open the Amazon SNS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose Topics.
3. Select the SNS topic that you want to remediate.
4. Choose the Access policy tab.
5. In the Access policy editor, locate the statement that grants global subscribe permissions. It should look like this:

```
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "SNS:Subscribe",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyTopic",
  "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
      "AWS:SourceOwner": "123456789012"
    }
  }
}
```

6. Remove the `"Principal": "*"` line from the statement to restrict subscriptions to only AWS accounts that you explicitly specify.
7. Choose Save changes to update the access policy for the SNS topic.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration by removing global subscribe permissions from the SNS topic.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "SNS Topics Should Not Allow Global Subscribe" in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to list all the SNS topics in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws sns list-topics
   ```

3. Identify the SNS topic(s) that have global subscription enabled.

4. Run the following command to update the policy of the identified SNS topic(s) to disallow global subscription:

   ```
   aws sns set-topic-attributes --topic-arn <topic-arn> --attribute-name Policy --attribute-value '{"Version":"2008-10-17","Id":"__default_policy_ID","Statement":[{"Effect":"Deny","Principal":{"AWS":"*"},"Action":"SNS:Subscribe","Resource":"<topic-arn>"}]}'
   ```

   Replace `<topic-arn>` with the ARN of the identified SNS topic.

5. Verify that the policy has been updated successfully by running the following command:

   ```
   aws sns get-topic-attributes --topic-arn <topic-arn> --attribute-names Policy
   ```

   Replace `<topic-arn>` with the ARN of the identified SNS topic.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for all the SNS topics that have global subscription enabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "SNS Topics Should Not Allow Global Subscribe" in AWS using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "SNS Topics Should Not Allow Global Subscribe" in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to get a list of all the SNS topics in your AWS account using the boto3 library in Python. You can use the following code snippet to achieve this:

```
import boto3

sns = boto3.client('sns')
response = sns.list_topics()
topics = response['Topics']
```

2. Once you have the list of all SNS topics, you can iterate through each topic and check if it allows global subscriptions. To do this, you need to get the policy of the SNS topic using the `get_topic_attributes` method and then check if the policy allows global subscriptions. You can use the following code snippet to achieve this:

```
for topic in topics:
    topic_arn = topic['TopicArn']
    attributes = sns.get_topic_attributes(TopicArn=topic_arn)
    policy = attributes['Attributes']['Policy']
    if 'AllowEveryoneToSubscribe' in policy:
        # Remove the global subscription permission
        policy = policy.replace('"AllowEveryoneToSubscribe": "true"', '"AllowEveryoneToSubscribe": "false"')
        # Update the policy
        sns.set_topic_attributes(TopicArn=topic_arn, AttributeName='Policy', AttributeValue=policy)
```

3. Finally, you need to test the remediation by checking if the SNS topics still allow global subscriptions. You can use the same code snippet in step 2 to check the policy of each SNS topic and make sure that the "AllowEveryoneToSubscribe" parameter is set to "false".

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "SNS Topics Should Not Allow Global Subscribe" in AWS using Python.
