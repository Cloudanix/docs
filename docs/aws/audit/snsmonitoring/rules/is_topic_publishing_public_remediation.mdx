How to implement the required permissions to secure the exposed SNS topics?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the left navigation panel, select Topics. Then Select the AWS SNS topic that you want to reconfigure.
  (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource).

- Step 2: Click the Actions button from the dashboard top menu and select Edit topic policy.

- Step 3: Inside the Edit topic policy dialog box, perform one of the following actions:
  A: Select the Basic View tab to update the access policy with the basic editor and within Allow these users to publish messages to this topic section, set the following:
  a. Select Only me (topic owner) to limit all the publish requests to the topic owner only.
  b. Select Only these AWS users and provide valid AWS account IDs to limit message publishing to those specified AWS accounts only.
  B: Select the Advanced View tab and paste your own custom policy document to update the SNS topic permissions based on your requirements. Make sure that you replace the Principal element value (i.e "AWS": "_") with specific (trusted) AWS users, e.g. replace "Principal": \{ "AWS" : "_" \} with "Principal": \{ "AWS" : "IAM_USER_ARN" \}, or use the existing Principal elements together with Condition clauses to filter the user access for publishing. You can create custom SNS policies using the AWS Policy Generator available at https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html

- Step 4: Click Update policy to apply the new permissions.
