### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon SNS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home.

2. In the navigation pane, choose 'Topics'. This will display a list of all the SNS topics in your account.

3. Click on the ARN of the topic you want to check. This will open the details page for that topic.

4. In the 'Topic policy' section, check the 'Principal' and 'Action' fields. If the 'Principal' is set to '*' (which means everyone) and the 'Action' is set to 'SNS:Publish', it means the SNS topic is exposed.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all SNS topics: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the SNS topics in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws sns list-topics
   ```
   This command will return a list of all SNS topics along with their ARNs (Amazon Resource Names).

3. Get the policy of each SNS topic: For each SNS topic, you need to check its policy to see if it's exposed. You can do this by running the following command for each topic ARN:

   ```
   aws sns get-topic-attributes --topic-arn <Topic-ARN>
   ```
   Replace `<Topic-ARN>` with the ARN of the SNS topic you want to check. This command will return the attributes of the specified SNS topic, including its policy.

4. Check the policy: The policy of the SNS topic will be returned in JSON format. You need to check if the policy allows the "sns:Publish" action for the "*" principal, which means that the topic is exposed. If the policy contains the following statement, then the SNS topic is exposed:

   ```
   {
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Principal": "*",
     "Action": "sns:Publish"
   }
   ```
   If you find this statement in the policy of any SNS topic, then that topic is misconfigured and exposed.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   You need to install and configure Boto3 to interact with AWS services. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials either by setting environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional), or by using the AWS CLI command `aws configure`.

2. List all SNS topics:
   Use the `list_topics` method to retrieve all SNS topics. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   sns = boto3.client('sns')
   response = sns.list_topics()
   topics = response['Topics']
   ```

3. Check the policy of each SNS topic:
   For each SNS topic, get the policy and check if it is exposed. If the policy allows the `"sns:Publish"` action for `"Principal": "*"`, then the topic is exposed. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   for topic in topics:
       arn = topic['TopicArn']
       attrs = sns.get_topic_attributes(TopicArn=arn)
       policy = json.loads(attrs['Attributes']['Policy'])
       for statement in policy['Statement']:
           if statement['Effect'] == 'Allow' and statement['Principal'] == '*':
               if 'sns:Publish' in statement['Action']:
                   print(f"Exposed SNS Topic: {arn}")
   ```

4. Run the script:
   Save the script in a file, for example `check_sns.py`, and run it using Python:
   ```
   python check_sns.py
   ```
   The script will print the ARNs of all exposed SNS topics. If no output is produced, then no exposed SNS topics were found.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the SNS Topics Should Not Be Exposed issue in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to your AWS console.
2. Open the SNS service.
3. Click on the topic that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Access policy" tab.
5. Review the policy to ensure that it only allows access to the necessary users and roles.
6. If the policy allows public access, click on the "Edit" button.
7. Update the policy to restrict access to only the necessary users and roles.
8. Click on the "Save changes" button to save the updated policy.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the SNS Topics Should Not Be Exposed issue in AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "SNS Topics Should Not Be Exposed" in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the exposed SNS topics in your AWS account using the following AWS CLI command:
```
aws sns list-topics
```

2. Once you have identified the exposed SNS topics, you can remove the public access policy from them using the following AWS CLI command:
```
aws sns set-topic-attributes --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyTopic --attribute-name Policy --attribute-value ""
```
Note: Replace the topic ARN with the ARN of the exposed SNS topic in your AWS account.

3. You can also restrict access to the SNS topic by updating the access policy to allow only authorized AWS accounts or IAM users to access it. You can use the following AWS CLI command to update the access policy:
```
aws sns set-topic-attributes --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyTopic --attribute-name Policy --attribute-value '{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/MyUser" }, "Action": "sns:Publish", "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyTopic" } ] }'
```
Note: Replace the topic ARN and IAM user ARN with the ARNs of the exposed SNS topic and authorized IAM user in your AWS account.

4. Finally, you can also enable SNS encryption using AWS KMS to ensure that the data in the SNS topic is encrypted at rest and in transit. You can use the following AWS CLI command to enable SNS encryption:
```
aws sns set-topic-attributes --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyTopic --attribute-name KmsMasterKeyId --attribute-value "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
```
Note: Replace the topic ARN and KMS key ARN with the ARNs of the SNS topic and KMS key in your AWS account.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "SNS Topics Should Not Be Exposed" in your AWS account using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "SNS Topics Should Not Be Exposed" in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Create an AWS Lambda function with the following code:

```python
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    sns = boto3.client('sns')
    topics = sns.list_topics()['Topics']
    for topic in topics:
        topic_arn = topic['TopicArn']
        response = sns.remove_permission(
            TopicArn=topic_arn,
            Label='Everyone'
        )
        print(response)
```

Step 2: Save and deploy the Lambda function to your AWS account.

Step 3: Create an AWS CloudWatch Event Rule that triggers the Lambda function on a schedule or based on a specific event.

Step 4: Test the Lambda function to ensure that it removes the "Everyone" permission from all SNS topics in your AWS account.

This code will remove the "Everyone" permission from all SNS topics in your AWS account, which will prevent unauthorized access to your SNS topics.
