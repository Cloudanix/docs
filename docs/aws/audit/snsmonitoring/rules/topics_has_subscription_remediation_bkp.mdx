### Remediation

How to remediate if SNS topics don't have subscriptions?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify SNS Topics:
   - Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the SNS service.
   - Go to the "Topics" section and review the list of existing topics.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "SNS Topics Should Have Subscription" Policy.)
   - Identify the topics that do not have any subscriptions.
2. Review Topic Configuration:
   - Access Topic Details:
     - Select each topic without subscriptions to access its configuration.
   - Verify Topic Purpose:
     - Validate the purpose and necessity of each topic.
     - Ensure that there are no pending or unfinished tasks associated with the topics.
3. Delete Unnecessary Topics:
   - Delete Unneeded Topics:
     - If you determine that a topic is no longer needed, select the topic and click on the "Delete" button.
     - Confirm the deletion when prompted.
4. Create Subscriptions:
   - Assess Subscription Requirements:
     - Determine the appropriate subscriptions needed for each topic based on their purpose and intended recipients.
   - Create Subscriptions:
     - Select each topic that requires subscriptions and click on the "Create subscription" button.
     - Configure the subscription details, such as the protocol (e.g., email, SMS, HTTP, etc.) and endpoint (e.g., email address, phone number, endpoint URL, etc.).
     - Repeat the process for each topic that requires a subscription.
