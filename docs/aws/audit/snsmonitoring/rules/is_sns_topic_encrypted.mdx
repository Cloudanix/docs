<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent SNS Topics from being unencrypted in AWS using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Customer Master Key (CMK) in AWS KMS:**
   First, you need to create a CMK in AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to use for encrypting your SNS topics.

   ```sh
   aws kms create-key --description "Key for SNS Topic Encryption" --key-usage ENCRYPT_DECRYPT --origin AWS_KMS
   ```

2. **Get the Key ID or ARN of the CMK:**
   After creating the CMK, you need to retrieve its Key ID or ARN to use it in the SNS topic configuration.

   ```sh
   aws kms list-keys
   ```

3. **Create an SNS Topic with Server-Side Encryption (SSE):**
   When creating an SNS topic, specify the KMS Key ID or ARN to enable encryption.

   ```sh
   aws sns create-topic --name MyEncryptedTopic --attributes KmsMasterKeyId=<Your-KMS-Key-ID-or-ARN>
   ```

4. **Update an Existing SNS Topic to Enable Encryption:**
   If you have an existing SNS topic, you can update it to enable encryption using the KMS Key ID or ARN.

   ```sh
   aws sns set-topic-attributes --topic-arn <Your-SNS-Topic-ARN> --attribute-name KmsMasterKeyId --attribute-value <Your-KMS-Key-ID-or-ARN>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your SNS topics are encrypted using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To ensure that Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) topics are encrypted, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to enforce encryption settings. Below are the steps to prevent SNS topics from being unencrypted using a Python script:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by creating a `~/.aws/credentials` file.

3. **Create a Python Script to Enforce Encryption**:
   Write a Python script that will check existing SNS topics and ensure they are encrypted. If they are not, the script will update the topic to enable encryption.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon SNS
   sns_client = boto3.client('sns')

   # Function to enforce encryption on SNS topics
   def enforce_encryption_on_sns_topics():
       # List all SNS topics
       response = sns_client.list_topics()
       topics = response.get('Topics', [])

       for topic in topics:
           topic_arn = topic['TopicArn']
           
           # Get the attributes of the topic
           attributes = sns_client.get_topic_attributes(TopicArn=topic_arn)
           kms_master_key_id = attributes['Attributes'].get('KmsMasterKeyId')

           # If the topic is not encrypted, encrypt it
           if not kms_master_key_id:
               print(f"Encrypting SNS topic: {topic_arn}")
               sns_client.set_topic_attributes(
                   TopicArn=topic_arn,
                   AttributeName='KmsMasterKeyId',
                   AttributeValue='alias/aws/sns'  # Use the default AWS managed key for SNS
               )
           else:
               print(f"SNS topic {topic_arn} is already encrypted.")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       enforce_encryption_on_sns_topics()
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to ensure all your SNS topics are encrypted.
   ```bash
   python enforce_sns_encryption.py
   ```

This script will list all SNS topics in your AWS account, check if they are encrypted, and if not, it will apply encryption using the default AWS managed key for SNS (`alias/aws/sns`). You can modify the `AttributeValue` to use a custom KMS key if needed.

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Simple Notification Service (SNS) dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu, then typing "SNS" in the search box and selecting "Simple Notification Service".
3. In the SNS dashboard, select "Topics" from the left-hand navigation pane. This will display a list of all the SNS topics in your AWS account.
4. For each topic, check the "Encryption" column. If the column is blank or shows "Disabled", then the SNS topic is not encrypted. If it shows "Enabled", then the topic is encrypted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to list all the SNS topics in your AWS account. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws sns list-topics
```

This command will return a list of all SNS topics in your AWS account.

2. Once you have the list of SNS topics, you can check the encryption status of each topic. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws sns get-topic-attributes --topic-arn <TopicARN>
```

Replace `<TopicARN>` with the ARN of the SNS topic you want to check. This command will return the attributes of the specified SNS topic.

3. In the output of the above command, look for the `KmsMasterKeyId` attribute. If this attribute is present and has a value, it means that the SNS topic is encrypted.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each SNS topic in your AWS account. If any SNS topic does not have the `KmsMasterKeyId` attribute or if this attribute does not have a value, it means that the SNS topic is not encrypted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so. You can install it using pip:
```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials:
```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Use the SNS client from the session to get all the SNS topics:
```python
sns = session.client('sns')
response = sns.list_topics()
```

4. Iterate over the topics and check if they are encrypted. If the 'KmsMasterKeyId' key is not present in the topic attributes, the topic is not encrypted:
```python
for topic in response['Topics']:
    topic_arn = topic['TopicArn']
    topic_attributes = sns.get_topic_attributes(TopicArn=topic_arn)['Attributes']
    if 'KmsMasterKeyId' not in topic_attributes:
        print(f'Topic {topic_arn} is not encrypted.')
```
This script will print the ARNs of all unencrypted SNS topics.
