How to encrypt Amazon SNS topic data with your own KMS CMK?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using an account with administrative privileges.
2. Open the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) console by navigating to the KMS service.
3. Create a new KMS CMK or use an existing one that you want to use for encrypting SNS topic data. Ensure that the CMK is enabled and has appropriate permissions.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "SNS Topics Should Be Encrypted Using KMS CMKs" Policy.)
4. Note down the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the KMS CMK that you want to use.
5. Open the Amazon SNS console by navigating to the SNS service.
6. Select the SNS topic for which you want to enable encryption.
7. In the topic details page, click on the "Edit" button.
8. Scroll down to the "Server-side encryption" section and select the option "Enable encryption using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)".
9. In the "AWS KMS key ARN" field, enter the ARN of the KMS CMK that you want to use for encryption.
10. Click on the "Save changes" button to apply the encryption settings to the SNS topic.
