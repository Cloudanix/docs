### More Info:

SNS Topics should be encrypted with Customer managed keys (CMK) instead of AWS managed keys in order to have a more granular control over the SNS data-at-rest encryption and decryption process.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

HIPAA, HITRUST, NISTCSF, PCIDSS

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration in AWS:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon SNS console.
3. Click on the SNS topic that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Encryption" tab.
5. Select "Enable encryption" option.
6. Select the KMS key that you want to use to encrypt the topic.
7. Click on "Update" to save the changes.

After following these steps, your SNS topic will be encrypted using the KMS CMKs.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the SNS topics that are not encrypted using KMS CMKs by running the following command:
```
aws sns list-topics --query "Topics[?KmsMasterKeyId == null].TopicArn" --output text
```

2. For each topic identified in step 1, create a new KMS CMK or use an existing one.

3. Enable server-side encryption for the SNS topic by updating its properties with the following command:
```
aws sns set-topic-attributes --topic-arn <topic-arn> --attribute-name KmsMasterKeyId --attribute-value <kms-key-id>
```
Replace `<topic-arn>` with the ARN of the SNS topic and `<kms-key-id>` with the ARN of the KMS CMK created in step 2.

4. Verify that the SNS topic is now encrypted using KMS CMKs by running the following command:
```
aws sns list-topics --query "Topics[?KmsMasterKeyId != null].TopicArn" --output text
```
This command should return the ARN of the SNS topic that was just updated.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all the SNS topics that were identified in step 1.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of SNS topics not being encrypted using KMS CMKs in AWS.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of SNS Topics not being encrypted using KMS CMKs in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to identify the SNS topic(s) that are not encrypted using KMS CMKs. You can use the AWS CLI or Boto3 library in Python to list all the SNS topics and their encryption status.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create an SNS client
   sns = boto3.client('sns')

   # List all SNS topics
   response = sns.list_topics()

   # Check encryption status for each topic
   for topic_arn in response['Topics']:
       topic_attributes = sns.get_topic_attributes(TopicArn=topic_arn['TopicArn'])
       if 'KmsMasterKeyId' not in topic_attributes['Attributes']:
           print(f"SNS topic {topic_arn['TopicArn']} is not encrypted using KMS CMKs")
   ```

2. Once you have identified the SNS topic(s) that are not encrypted using KMS CMKs, you can update their encryption settings using the `set_topic_attributes()` method in Boto3.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create an SNS client
   sns = boto3.client('sns')

   # Update encryption settings for a specific topic
   topic_arn = 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic'
   response = sns.set_topic_attributes(
       TopicArn=topic_arn,
       AttributeName='KmsMasterKeyId',
       AttributeValue='arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abcd1234-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab'
   )

   print(f"Encryption settings updated for SNS topic {topic_arn}")
   ```

   Note: Replace the `topic_arn` and `AttributeValue` with the appropriate values for your AWS account.

3. Finally, you can verify that the SNS topic(s) are now encrypted using KMS CMKs by running the first code snippet again and checking the encryption status for each topic.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create an SNS client
   sns = boto3.client('sns')

   # List all SNS topics
   response = sns.list_topics()

   # Check encryption status for each topic
   for topic_arn in response['Topics']:
       topic_attributes = sns.get_topic_attributes(TopicArn=topic_arn['TopicArn'])
       if 'KmsMasterKeyId' not in topic_attributes['Attributes']:
           print(f"SNS topic {topic_arn['TopicArn']} is not encrypted using KMS CMKs")
       else:
           print(f"SNS topic {topic_arn['TopicArn']} is encrypted using KMS CMKs")
   ```

   This should return a list of all SNS topics and their encryption status.
