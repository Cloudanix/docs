### Remediation

How to create a new subscription using HTTPS?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using an account with appropriate permissions.
2. Open the Amazon SNS console by navigating to the SNS service.
3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Topics" and select the topic to which you want to create the subscription.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "AWS SNS Subscription Should Not Use HTTP As Delivery Protocol" Policy.)
4. In the topic details page, click on the "Create subscription" button.
5. In the "Create subscription" wizard, select "HTTPS" as the protocol for the subscription.
6. Enter the endpoint URL for the HTTPS subscription. This should be the URL of the server or endpoint that will receive the notifications. Make sure the endpoint is accessible over HTTPS.
7. (Optional) If you want to encrypt the message payload using a client-side certificate, you can provide the certificate ARN in the "Certificate" field.
8. Click on the "Create subscription" button to create the HTTPS subscription.
9. The endpoint server or service will receive a confirmation request to validate the subscription. Follow the necessary steps on the endpoint side to confirm the subscription.
