1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Simple Notification Service (SNS) dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu, then typing "SNS" in the search box and selecting "Simple Notification Service".
3. In the SNS dashboard, select "Topics" from the left-hand navigation pane. This will display a list of all the SNS topics available within your current AWS region.
4. For each topic in the list, check the "KMS master key" column. If the column displays "Default", it means that the SNS topic is not encrypted with a customer-managed KMS key, indicating a potential misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to list all the SNS topics in your AWS account. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

   ```
   aws sns list-topics
   ```
   This command will return a list of all SNS topics in your AWS account.

2. Once you have the list of SNS topics, you can check the encryption status of each topic. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

   ```
   aws sns get-topic-attributes --topic-arn <TopicARN>
   ```
   Replace `<TopicARN>` with the ARN of the SNS topic you want to check. This command will return the attributes of the specified SNS topic.

3. From the returned attributes, check the `KmsMasterKeyId` attribute. If this attribute is not present or is set to `alias/aws/sns`, then the SNS topic is not encrypted with a KMS CMK.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each SNS topic in your AWS account.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) on your local system. This will allow you to interact with AWS services including SNS.

```python
pip install boto3
aws configure
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials.

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Create a client for SNS and list all the SNS topics.

```python
sns = session.client('sns')
response = sns.list_topics()
```

4. Iterate over the list of topics and check if they are encrypted using KMS CMKs. If the 'KmsMasterKeyId' attribute is not present or not set, then the SNS topic is not encrypted using KMS CMKs.

```python
for topic in response['Topics']:
    topic_attributes = sns.get_topic_attributes(TopicArn=topic['TopicArn'])
    if 'KmsMasterKeyId' not in topic_attributes['Attributes']:
        print(f"SNS Topic {topic['TopicArn']} is not encrypted using KMS CMKs.")
```

This script will print out the ARNs of all SNS topics that are not encrypted using KMS CMKs.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration in AWS:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon SNS console.
3. Click on the SNS topic that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Encryption" tab.
5. Select "Enable encryption" option.
6. Select the KMS key that you want to use to encrypt the topic.
7. Click on "Update" to save the changes.

After following these steps, your SNS topic will be encrypted using the KMS CMKs.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the SNS topics that are not encrypted using KMS CMKs by running the following command:
```
aws sns list-topics --query "Topics[?KmsMasterKeyId == null].TopicArn" --output text
```

2. For each topic identified in step 1, create a new KMS CMK or use an existing one.

3. Enable server-side encryption for the SNS topic by updating its properties with the following command:
```
aws sns set-topic-attributes --topic-arn <topic-arn> --attribute-name KmsMasterKeyId --attribute-value <kms-key-id>
```
Replace `<topic-arn>` with the ARN of the SNS topic and `<kms-key-id>` with the ARN of the KMS CMK created in step 2.

4. Verify that the SNS topic is now encrypted using KMS CMKs by running the following command:
```
aws sns list-topics --query "Topics[?KmsMasterKeyId != null].TopicArn" --output text
```
This command should return the ARN of the SNS topic that was just updated.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all the SNS topics that were identified in step 1.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of SNS topics not being encrypted using KMS CMKs in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of SNS Topics not being encrypted using KMS CMKs in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to identify the SNS topic(s) that are not encrypted using KMS CMKs. You can use the AWS CLI or Boto3 library in Python to list all the SNS topics and their encryption status.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create an SNS client
   sns = boto3.client('sns')

   # List all SNS topics
   response = sns.list_topics()

   # Check encryption status for each topic
   for topic_arn in response['Topics']:
       topic_attributes = sns.get_topic_attributes(TopicArn=topic_arn['TopicArn'])
       if 'KmsMasterKeyId' not in topic_attributes['Attributes']:
           print(f"SNS topic {topic_arn['TopicArn']} is not encrypted using KMS CMKs")
   ```

2. Once you have identified the SNS topic(s) that are not encrypted using KMS CMKs, you can update their encryption settings using the `set_topic_attributes()` method in Boto3.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create an SNS client
   sns = boto3.client('sns')

   # Update encryption settings for a specific topic
   topic_arn = 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic'
   response = sns.set_topic_attributes(
       TopicArn=topic_arn,
       AttributeName='KmsMasterKeyId',
       AttributeValue='arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abcd1234-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab'
   )

   print(f"Encryption settings updated for SNS topic {topic_arn}")
   ```

   Note: Replace the `topic_arn` and `AttributeValue` with the appropriate values for your AWS account.

3. Finally, you can verify that the SNS topic(s) are now encrypted using KMS CMKs by running the first code snippet again and checking the encryption status for each topic.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create an SNS client
   sns = boto3.client('sns')

   # List all SNS topics
   response = sns.list_topics()

   # Check encryption status for each topic
   for topic_arn in response['Topics']:
       topic_attributes = sns.get_topic_attributes(TopicArn=topic_arn['TopicArn'])
       if 'KmsMasterKeyId' not in topic_attributes['Attributes']:
           print(f"SNS topic {topic_arn['TopicArn']} is not encrypted using KMS CMKs")
       else:
           print(f"SNS topic {topic_arn['TopicArn']} is encrypted using KMS CMKs")
   ```

   This should return a list of all SNS topics and their encryption status.
