How to update the access control policies attached to the SNS topics that are publicly accessible?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the left navigation panel, select Topics. Select the AWS SNS topic that you want to reconfigure.
  (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource).

- Step 2: Click the Actions button from the dashboard top menu and select Edit topic policy.

- Step 3: Inside the Edit topic policy dialog box, perform one of the following:
  A: Select the Basic View tab to update the access policy with the basic editor and within Allow these users to subscribe to this topic section, set the following:
  a. Select Only me (topic owner) to limit all the subscription requests to the topic owner only.
  b. Select Only these AWS users and provide valid AWS account IDs to limit subscription to those specified AWS accounts only.
  c. Select Only users with endpoints that match and type valid endpoints (email addresses, application URLs, etc) to limit subscribing only to the specified endpoints.
  d. In the Using these delivery protocols section, select any delivery protocols required for subscription requests.
  B: Select the Advanced View tab and paste your own custom policy document to update the topic permissions based on your requirements. Make sure that you replace the Principal element value (i.e "AWS": "_") with specific (trusted) AWS users, e.g. replace "Principal": { "AWS" : "_" } with "Principal": { "AWS" : "IAM_USER_ARN" }, or use the existing Principal elements together with Condition clauses to filter the user access. You can create custom SNS policies using the AWS Policy Generator available at https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html

- Step 4: Click Update policy to apply for the new topic permissions.
