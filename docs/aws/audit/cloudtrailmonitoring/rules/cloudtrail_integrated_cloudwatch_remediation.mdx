1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the CloudTrail service. On the CloudTrail home page, click on "Trails" in the left navigation pane.
3. In the Trails page, select the trail that you want to check. In the details pane, look for the "CloudWatch Logs" section.
4. If the "Log group" and "Log role ARN" fields are populated, it means that CloudTrail events are being monitored by CloudWatch Logs. If these fields are not populated, it indicates a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. **Check the existing CloudTrail trails:**
   First, you need to check the existing CloudTrail trails. You can do this by using the AWS CLI command `describe-trails`. This command will return a list of trail ARNs (Amazon Resource Names) and their respective settings.

   Command:
   ```
   aws cloudtrail describe-trails
   ```

2. **Check the CloudWatch Logs for each trail:**
   For each trail returned by the previous command, you need to check if it has a CloudWatch Logs log group associated with it. This can be done by checking the `CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn` field in the trail's settings.

   You can use the `get-trail-status` command to get the status of a specific trail. Replace `<TrailName>` with the name of the trail you want to check.

   Command:
   ```
   aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name <TrailName>
   ```

3. **Check the CloudWatch Logs log group:**
   If a trail has a CloudWatch Logs log group associated with it, you need to check if the log group is receiving log events from CloudTrail. This can be done by checking the `lastEventReceived` field in the log group's settings.

   You can use the `describe-log-groups` command to get the settings of a specific log group. Replace `<LogGroupName>` with the name of the log group you want to check.

   Command:
   ```
   aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name <LogGroupName>
   ```

4. **Check the CloudWatch Logs metric filters:**
   Finally, you need to check if the log group has any metric filters that match CloudTrail events. This can be done by checking the `filterPattern` field in the metric filter's settings.

   You can use the `describe-metric-filters` command to get the metric filters of a specific log group. Replace `<LogGroupName>` with the name of the log group you want to check.

   Command:
   ```
   aws logs describe-metric-filters --log-group-name <LogGroupName>
   ```
   
If any of these checks fail, it means that CloudTrail events are not being monitored by CloudWatch Logs.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Import necessary libraries and establish a session**: To start with, you need to import the necessary libraries in your Python script. Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. 

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import BotoCoreError, ClientError
```
Then, establish a session using your AWS credentials.

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    aws_session_token='SESSION_TOKEN',
)
```

2. **Create a CloudTrail client**: After establishing a session, create a CloudTrail client to interact with the service.

```python
cloudtrail = session.client('cloudtrail')
```

3. **List all trails and check for CloudWatch Logs integration**: Now, list all trails and check if they are integrated with CloudWatch Logs. If the "CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn" attribute is not present, it means that the trail is not monitored by CloudWatch Logs.

```python
def check_trail_monitoring():
    response = cloudtrail.describe_trails()
    for trail in response['trailList']:
        if 'CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn' not in trail:
            print(f"Trail {trail['Name']} is not monitored by CloudWatch Logs")
```

4. **Call the function**: Finally, call the function to check the monitoring status of all trails.

```python
check_trail_monitoring()
```

This script will print the names of all trails that are not monitored by CloudWatch Logs. If no such trails are found, it means that all trails are properly monitored.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudTrail Events Should Be Monitored By CloudWatch Logs" in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudTrail service.

2. Select the trail for which you want to enable CloudWatch Logs monitoring.

3. Click on the "Edit" button in the "CloudWatch Logs" section.

4. Select the option "Yes" for "Enable CloudWatch Logs".

5. Choose a CloudWatch Logs log group to which you want to send the CloudTrail events.

6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

7. Verify that the CloudWatch Logs integration is working by checking the log group for the CloudTrail events.

By following these steps, you will have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "CloudTrail Events Should Be Monitored By CloudWatch Logs" in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudTrail Events Should Be Monitored By CloudWatch Logs" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to create a new CloudWatch Logs group:

   ```
   aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name my-log-group-name
   ```

   Replace `my-log-group-name` with the name you want to give to your CloudWatch Logs group.

3. Run the following command to create a new CloudWatch Logs stream:

   ```
   aws logs create-log-stream --log-group-name my-log-group-name --log-stream-name my-log-stream-name
   ```

   Replace `my-log-group-name` with the name of the CloudWatch Logs group you created in step 2, and replace `my-log-stream-name` with the name you want to give to your CloudWatch Logs stream.

4. Run the following command to enable CloudTrail log file validation:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail update-trail --name my-trail-name --enable-log-file-validation
   ```

   Replace `my-trail-name` with the name of the CloudTrail trail you want to enable log file validation for.

5. Run the following command to configure CloudTrail to send events to your CloudWatch Logs group:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail update-trail --name my-trail-name --cloud-watch-logs-log-group-arn arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:my-log-group-name --cloud-watch-logs-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-cloudtrail-role
   ```

   Replace `my-trail-name` with the name of the CloudTrail trail you want to configure, replace `arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:my-log-group-name` with the ARN of the CloudWatch Logs group you created in step 2, and replace `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-cloudtrail-role` with the ARN of the IAM role you want to use for CloudTrail.

   Note: You need to have the required permissions to create CloudWatch Logs group, stream and IAM role.

6. Verify that CloudTrail events are being sent to your CloudWatch Logs group by checking the logs in the CloudWatch Logs console.

   Congratulations! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "CloudTrail Events Should Be Monitored By CloudWatch Logs" for AWS using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS, you can use the following steps in Python:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```
import boto3
```

2. Create a CloudWatch Logs client:

```
cloudwatch_logs = boto3.client('logs')
```

3. Get a list of all the existing CloudTrail logs:

```
cloudtrail_logs = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
logs = cloudtrail_logs.describe_trails()
```

4. For each CloudTrail log, check if it is already being monitored by CloudWatch Logs:

```
for log in logs['trailList']:
    log_name = log['Name']
    response = cloudwatch_logs.describe_log_groups(logGroupNamePrefix=log_name)
    if not response['logGroups']:
        # Create a new log group for the CloudTrail log
        cloudwatch_logs.create_log_group(logGroupName=log_name)
    # Create a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter for the CloudTrail log
    cloudwatch_logs.put_subscription_filter(
        logGroupName=log_name,
        filterName='CloudTrailFilter',
        filterPattern='',
        destinationArn=''
    )
```

5. Replace the `destinationArn` parameter with the ARN of the CloudWatch Logs destination you want to use.

6. Save the Python script and run it to remediate the misconfiguration.

This script will create a new CloudWatch Logs log group for each CloudTrail log that is not already being monitored, and then create a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter for that log group. This will ensure that all CloudTrail events are monitored by CloudWatch Logs.
