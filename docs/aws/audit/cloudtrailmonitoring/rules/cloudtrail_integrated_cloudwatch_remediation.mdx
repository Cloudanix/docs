### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the CloudTrail service. On the CloudTrail home page, click on "Trails" in the left navigation pane.
3. In the Trails page, select the trail that you want to examine. In the trail details pane, look for the "CloudWatch Logs" section.
4. Check if the "Log group" field is populated and the "Log group ARN" is displayed. If these fields are empty, it means that CloudTrail events are not being monitored by CloudWatch Logs for the selected trail.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs.

2. Once AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can use the following command to list all the trails in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail describe-trails
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the trails.

3. For each trail, check if it is integrated with CloudWatch Logs. You can do this by checking the "CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn" field in the output of the previous command. If this field is empty or not present, then the trail is not monitored by CloudWatch Logs.

4. To further confirm, you can use the following command to get the status of a specific trail:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name <trail_name>
   ```
   Replace `<trail_name>` with the name of the trail you want to check. In the output, check the "IsLogging" field. If it is set to "false", then the trail is not being monitored by CloudWatch Logs.

#### Using Python

1. **Import necessary libraries and establish a session**: To start with, you need to import the necessary libraries in your Python script. Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. 

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import BotoCoreError, ClientError
```
Then, establish a session using your AWS credentials.

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

2. **Create a CloudTrail client**: After establishing a session, create a CloudTrail client to interact with the service.

```python
cloudtrail = session.client('cloudtrail')
```

3. **List all trails and check for CloudWatch Logs integration**: Now, list all the trails and check if they are integrated with CloudWatch Logs. If the `GetTrailStatus` response includes a `LatestCloudWatchLogsDeliveryTime`, then CloudTrail events are being monitored by CloudWatch Logs.

```python
trails = cloudtrail.describe_trails()
for trail in trails['trailList']:
    status = cloudtrail.get_trail_status(Name=trail['Name'])
    if 'LatestCloudWatchLogsDeliveryTime' not in status:
        print(f"Trail {trail['Name']} is not monitored by CloudWatch Logs")
```

4. **Handle exceptions**: It's important to handle exceptions in your script to avoid runtime errors. You can catch `BotoCoreError` and `ClientError` exceptions, which cover most of the exceptions that can be thrown by Boto3.

```python
try:
    # Your code here
except BotoCoreError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
except ClientError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This script will help you detect if CloudTrail events are being monitored by CloudWatch Logs. If a trail is not monitored, it will print a message with the trail name.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudTrail Events Should Be Monitored By CloudWatch Logs" in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudTrail service.

2. Select the trail for which you want to enable CloudWatch Logs monitoring.

3. Click on the "Edit" button in the "CloudWatch Logs" section.

4. Select the option "Yes" for "Enable CloudWatch Logs".

5. Choose a CloudWatch Logs log group to which you want to send the CloudTrail events.

6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

7. Verify that the CloudWatch Logs integration is working by checking the log group for the CloudTrail events.

By following these steps, you will have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "CloudTrail Events Should Be Monitored By CloudWatch Logs" in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudTrail Events Should Be Monitored By CloudWatch Logs" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to create a new CloudWatch Logs group:

   ```
   aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name my-log-group-name
   ```

   Replace `my-log-group-name` with the name you want to give to your CloudWatch Logs group.

3. Run the following command to create a new CloudWatch Logs stream:

   ```
   aws logs create-log-stream --log-group-name my-log-group-name --log-stream-name my-log-stream-name
   ```

   Replace `my-log-group-name` with the name of the CloudWatch Logs group you created in step 2, and replace `my-log-stream-name` with the name you want to give to your CloudWatch Logs stream.

4. Run the following command to enable CloudTrail log file validation:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail update-trail --name my-trail-name --enable-log-file-validation
   ```

   Replace `my-trail-name` with the name of the CloudTrail trail you want to enable log file validation for.

5. Run the following command to configure CloudTrail to send events to your CloudWatch Logs group:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail update-trail --name my-trail-name --cloud-watch-logs-log-group-arn arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:my-log-group-name --cloud-watch-logs-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-cloudtrail-role
   ```

   Replace `my-trail-name` with the name of the CloudTrail trail you want to configure, replace `arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:my-log-group-name` with the ARN of the CloudWatch Logs group you created in step 2, and replace `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-cloudtrail-role` with the ARN of the IAM role you want to use for CloudTrail.

   Note: You need to have the required permissions to create CloudWatch Logs group, stream and IAM role.

6. Verify that CloudTrail events are being sent to your CloudWatch Logs group by checking the logs in the CloudWatch Logs console.

   Congratulations! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "CloudTrail Events Should Be Monitored By CloudWatch Logs" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS, you can use the following steps in Python:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```
import boto3
```

2. Create a CloudWatch Logs client:

```
cloudwatch_logs = boto3.client('logs')
```

3. Get a list of all the existing CloudTrail logs:

```
cloudtrail_logs = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
logs = cloudtrail_logs.describe_trails()
```

4. For each CloudTrail log, check if it is already being monitored by CloudWatch Logs:

```
for log in logs['trailList']:
    log_name = log['Name']
    response = cloudwatch_logs.describe_log_groups(logGroupNamePrefix=log_name)
    if not response['logGroups']:
        # Create a new log group for the CloudTrail log
        cloudwatch_logs.create_log_group(logGroupName=log_name)
    # Create a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter for the CloudTrail log
    cloudwatch_logs.put_subscription_filter(
        logGroupName=log_name,
        filterName='CloudTrailFilter',
        filterPattern='',
        destinationArn=''
    )
```

5. Replace the `destinationArn` parameter with the ARN of the CloudWatch Logs destination you want to use.

6. Save the Python script and run it to remediate the misconfiguration.

This script will create a new CloudWatch Logs log group for each CloudTrail log that is not already being monitored, and then create a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter for that log group. This will ensure that all CloudTrail events are monitored by CloudWatch Logs.
