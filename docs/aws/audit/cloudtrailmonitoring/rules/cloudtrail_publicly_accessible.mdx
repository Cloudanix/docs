AWS CloudTrail logging buckets should not be publicly accessible. Using an overly permissive or insecure set of permissions for your CloudTrail logging S3 buckets could provide malicious users access to your AWS account log data which can increase exponentially the risk of unauthorized access.

### Risk Level

Critical

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

GDPR, HIPAA, CISAWS, CBP, AWSWAF, HITRUST, SOC2, NISTCSF, PCIDSS

### Remediation

How to remove public access to CloudTrail logging bucket?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Amazon S3 service by searching for "S3" in the AWS services search bar and selecting "S3" from the results.
3. In the S3 management console, you will see a list of your S3 buckets.
4. Identify the bucket(s) that are used for CloudTrail logging and are currently publicly accessible.
   (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "CloudTrail Logging Buckets Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" Policy.)
5. Click on the name of the bucket that you want to remediate.
6. In the bucket details page, navigate to the "Permissions" tab.
7. Under the "Access control list (ACL)" section, review the permissions assigned to the bucket.
8. Remove any permissions that grant public access by following these steps:
   - Click on the "Edit" button next to the permission you want to modify.
   - In the "Grantee" section, select the entry that represents public access (typically "Everyone" or "All users").
   - Click on the "Remove" button to remove the public access permission.
   - Repeat this process for all public access permissions.
9. Next, navigate to the "Bucket policy" tab.
10. Review the bucket policy, if any, to ensure there are no policies that grant public access.
   - If there is a bucket policy, click on the "Edit" button next to the policy.
   - Remove any statements or conditions that allow public access.
   - Click on the "Save changes" button to update the bucket policy.
11. Once you have removed public access permissions and modified the bucket policy, confirm that the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.
12. Repeat these steps for any other CloudTrail logging buckets that have public access.
