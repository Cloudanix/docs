### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/.

2. In the navigation pane, click on "Trails". 

3. In the Trails page, select the trail you want to check. 

4. In the details pane, under "S3", check the "Log file SSE-KMS encryption" field. If it is set to "No", then the trail is not recording both regional and global events.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by following the instructions provided in the AWS CLI User Guide.

2. List all trails: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the trails in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail describe-trails
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with the details of all the trails in your AWS account.

3. Check if the trail is recording both regional and global events: In the JSON output, look for the "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents" and "IsMultiRegionTrail" attributes. If the "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents" attribute is set to true, it means that the trail is recording global events. If the "IsMultiRegionTrail" attribute is set to true, it means that the trail is recording events from all regions.

4. Verify the configuration: If both "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents" and "IsMultiRegionTrail" are set to true for all trails, it means that all trails are correctly configured to record both regional and global events. If not, it indicates a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing Python scripts to interact with AWS, you need to install the necessary libraries. The primary library you need is boto3, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to interact with AWS services. You can set them in your environment variables:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key'
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_key'
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check CloudTrail configuration: The following Python script uses boto3 to interact with AWS CloudTrail and check if trails are recording both regional and global events:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_trail_configuration():
       client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
       response = client.describe_trails()
       
       for trail in response['trailList']:
           if not trail['IncludeGlobalServiceEvents']:
               print(f"Trail {trail['Name']} does not record global events")
           if not trail['IsMultiRegionTrail']:
               print(f"Trail {trail['Name']} does not record events in all regions")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_trail_configuration()
   ```
   
   This script first creates a client for AWS CloudTrail. It then calls the describe_trails method to get a list of all trails. For each trail, it checks the IncludeGlobalServiceEvents and IsMultiRegionTrail properties. If IncludeGlobalServiceEvents is False, the trail does not record global events. If IsMultiRegionTrail is False, the trail does not record events in all regions.

4. Run the Python script: You can run the Python script from the command line:

   ```bash
   python check_trail_configuration.py
   ```
   
   If there are any trails that do not record both regional and global events, their names will be printed to the console.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Trails Should Record Both Regional And Global Events" for AWS using AWS console, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudTrail service.

2. Select the trail that you want to update.

3. Click on the "Edit" button.

4. In the "Event selectors" section, make sure that "All" is selected under "Data events".

5. Under "Management events", select "Global services" and "Regional services".

6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

7. Verify that the trail is now recording both regional and global events by checking the "Event history" tab for the trail.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Trails Should Record Both Regional And Global Events" for AWS using AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt and ensure that you have AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS account credentials.

2. Run the following command to create a trail with the required settings:

```
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <trail-name> --s3-bucket-name <bucket-name> --include-global-service-events
```

Replace `<trail-name>` with a name for your trail and `<bucket-name>` with the name of the S3 bucket where you want to store your trail logs.

3. If you already have a trail created, you can update it to include global service events using the following command:

```
aws cloudtrail update-trail --name <trail-name> --include-global-service-events
```

Replace `<trail-name>` with the name of your existing trail.

4. Verify that your trail is recording both regional and global events by running the following command:

```
aws cloudtrail describe-trails --trail-name-list <trail-name>
```

This command will return the details of your trail, including the settings for recording regional and global events.

By following these steps, you will have remediated the misconfiguration and ensured that your AWS trail is recording both regional and global events.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Trails Should Record Both Regional And Global Events" for AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudTrail service.

2. Select the trail that needs to be updated and click on "Edit".

3. In the "Event selectors" section, click on "Add event selector".

4. In the "Create event selector" page, select "All events" under "Event selector type".

5. Select the regions for which you want to record events. You can select individual regions or select "All regions" to record events from all regions.

6. Select "Global services" to record events from global services.

7. Click on "Add event selector" to save the changes.

8. To automate this process using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).

9. Install Boto3 using the command "pip install boto3".

10. Write a Python script that uses the Boto3 library to update the CloudTrail trail.

11. Use the "update_trail" method of the "cloudtrail" client to update the trail.

12. Set the "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents" parameter to "True" to record events from global services.

13. Set the "EventSelectors" parameter to include all regions.

14. Save the script and run it to update the trail.

Here is a sample code to update a CloudTrail trail using Python and Boto3:

```
import boto3

# Create a CloudTrail client
client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')

# Update the trail
response = client.update_trail(
    Name='my-trail',
    IncludeGlobalServiceEvents=True,
    EventSelectors=[
        {
            'ReadWriteType': 'All',
            'IncludeManagementEvents': True,
            'DataResources': [
                {
                    'Type': 'AWS::S3::Object',
                    'Values': [
                        'arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*'
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

Note: Replace "my-trail" with the name of your trail and "my-bucket" with the name of your S3 bucket. Also, modify the "EventSelectors" parameter to include all regions.
