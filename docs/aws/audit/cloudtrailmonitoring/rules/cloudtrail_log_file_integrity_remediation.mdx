   ```sh
   aws cloudtrail update-trail --name <trail_name> --enable-log-file-validation
   ```

3. **Verify the Configuration:**
   After creating or updating the trail, verify that the File Integrity Validation is enabled by describing the trail:
   ```sh
   aws cloudtrail describe-trails --trail-name-list <trail_name>
   ```

   Look for the `LogFileValidationEnabled` field in the output and ensure it is set to `true`.

4. **Enable CloudTrail Logging:**
   Ensure that logging is enabled for the CloudTrail to start capturing events with file integrity validation:
   ```sh
   aws cloudtrail start-logging --name <trail_name>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that the File Integrity Validation feature is enabled for your CloudTrail using the AWS CLI.

Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by directly configuring the `~/.aws/credentials` file.

### Step 3: Create a Python Script
Create a Python script to enable File Integrity Validation for your CloudTrail trails.

```python
import boto3

# Initialize a session using Amazon CloudTrail
client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')

# List all trails
response = client.describe_trails()

# Iterate through each trail and enable File Integrity Validation
for trail in response['trailList']:
    trail_name = trail['Name']
    client.update_trail(
        Name=trail_name,
        EnableLogFileValidation=True
    )
    print(f"File Integrity Validation enabled for trail: {trail_name}")
```

### Step 4: Run the Script
Execute the script to ensure that File Integrity Validation is enabled for all your CloudTrail trails.

```bash
python enable_file_integrity_validation.py
```

### Summary
1. **Install Boto3**: Ensure the Boto3 library is installed.
2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**: Configure your AWS credentials.
3. **Create a Python Script**: Write a script to enable File Integrity Validation for all CloudTrail trails.
4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to apply the changes.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudTrail service. 

2. In the CloudTrail dashboard, click on "Trails" in the left navigation pane. This will display a list of all the trails in your AWS account.

3. Click on the name of the trail you want to check. This will open the trail's details page.

4. In the trail's details page, look for the "File integrity validation" section. If the status is "Yes", then the file integrity validation feature is enabled for the trail. If the status is "No", then the feature is not enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all trails: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the trails in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail describe-trails
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the trails.

3. Check File Integrity Validation Feature: For each trail, check if the `LogFileValidationEnabled` attribute is set to `true`. This attribute indicates whether the file integrity validation feature is enabled for the trail. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name TrailName
   ```
   Replace `TrailName` with the name of your trail. If the `LogFileValidationEnabled` attribute is set to `true`, the file integrity validation feature is enabled for the trail.

4. Repeat the process: Repeat step 3 for each trail in your AWS account. If any trail has the `LogFileValidationEnabled` attribute set to `false`, it means the file integrity validation feature is not enabled for that trail, indicating a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. This can be done using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and set up AWS credentials: In your Python script, you need to import the Boto3 library and set up your AWS credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key). You can do this using the AWS CLI or by manually setting them in your script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Set AWS credentials
   aws_access_key_id = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'
   aws_secret_access_key = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
   region_name = 'us-west-2' # or your preferred region

   # Create a session using your credentials
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id,
       aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key,
       region_name=region_name
   )
   ```

3. Create a CloudTrail client and list trails: Using the session you created, you can create a CloudTrail client and list all trails in your account:

   ```python
   # Create CloudTrail client
   cloudtrail = session.client('cloudtrail')

   # List all trails
   response = cloudtrail.describe_trails()

   for trail in response['trailList']:
       print(trail['Name'])
   ```

4. Check if File Integrity Validation is enabled: For each trail, you can check if File Integrity Validation is enabled by checking the 'LogFileValidationEnabled' attribute:

   ```python
   for trail in response['trailList']:
       if 'LogFileValidationEnabled' in trail:
           if trail['LogFileValidationEnabled']:
               print(f"File Integrity Validation is enabled for trail {trail['Name']}")
           else:
               print(f"File Integrity Validation is NOT enabled for trail {trail['Name']}")
       else:
           print(f"File Integrity Validation is NOT enabled for trail {trail['Name']}")
   ```

This script will print out the names of all trails in your AWS account and whether File Integrity Validation is enabled for each one.
