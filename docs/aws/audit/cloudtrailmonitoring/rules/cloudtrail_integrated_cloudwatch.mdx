How to integrate Cloudwatch and CloudTrail?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the CloudWatch service.
3. In the CloudWatch dashboard, click on "Events" in the left navigation pane.
4. Click on "Create rule" to define a new rule for capturing CloudTrail events.
5. In the rule configuration page, under "Event Source," select "Event pattern."
6. Click on "Edit" to define the event pattern.
7. In the event pattern editor, you can specify the specific CloudTrail events you want to capture. You can define filters based on event source, event name, or other event attributes. For example, you can capture all management events or specific API calls.
   (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "CloudTrail Events Should Be Monitored By CloudWatch Logs" Policy.)
8. After defining the event pattern, click on "Add target" to specify the target for the captured events.
9. In the target configuration, select "CloudWatch Logs" as the target.
10. Choose an existing CloudWatch Logs log group or create a new one to store the CloudTrail logs.
11. Configure any additional settings for the target, such as IAM role, permissions, or batch size.
12. Review the rule configuration and click on "Create rule" to create the CloudWatch Events rule.
13. Once the rule is created, CloudWatch will start capturing the specified CloudTrail events and storing them in the specified CloudWatch Logs log group.
14. To view the captured CloudTrail logs, navigate to the CloudWatch Logs service.
15. In the CloudWatch Logs dashboard, select the log group where the CloudTrail logs are stored.
16. You can now view and search the CloudTrail logs within the log group. You can also set up CloudWatch metric filters, alarms, or custom visualizations based on the CloudTrail logs.
