### More Info:

Your CloudTrail logs should be encrypted at rest using server-side encryption provided by AWS KMSâ€“Managed Keys (SSE-KMS) to enhance the security of your CloudTrail bucket

How to enable encryption for CloudTrail logs?

#### Using AWS Console

To enable encryption for CloudTrail logs in AWS, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an S3 bucket: If you don't already have an S3 bucket for storing your CloudTrail logs, create a new bucket or use an existing one. Make sure the bucket is in the same AWS Region where you want to enable CloudTrail.

2. Enable S3 bucket encryption: Enable server-side encryption for the S3 bucket. You can choose to use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage the encryption keys or use Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).

3. Create a KMS key (optional): If you choose to use KMS for encryption, create a new KMS key or use an existing one. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to use the key.

4. Enable CloudTrail encryption: Go to the CloudTrail service in the AWS Management Console.

5. Select your trail: Choose the CloudTrail trail for which you want to enable encryption.

6. Edit the trail settings: Click on the "Edit" button to modify the trail settings.

7. Enable log file encryption: Under the "Storage location" section, enable the option for "Encrypt log files." If you're using KMS, select the KMS key you created or want to use. If you're using SSE-S3, this step is not necessary.

8. Save the trail settings: Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Once encryption is enabled for your CloudTrail logs, all the log files generated by CloudTrail will be encrypted using the specified encryption method (either KMS or SSE-S3). Make sure you have the necessary permissions and access controls in place to manage the encryption keys and access the encrypted logs.
