### Remediation

How to disable API tracking/logging for AWS global services in the subsequent single region trails?

#### Using AWS Console

- In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Duplicate Entries Should Be Avoided In CloudTrail Logs" Policy.

- Step 1: Run update-trail command (OSX/Linux/UNIX) using the name of the Amazon CloudTrail trail that you want to reconfigure and the name of the associated region as identifier parameters, to update the selected trail configuration and disable tracking global service events in order to avoid duplication:
  aws cloudtrail update-trail
  --region us-east-1
  --name cc-main-trail
  --no-include-global-service-events
  --no-is-multi-region-trail

- Step 2: The command output should return the update-trail command request metadata:
  \{
  "Name": "cc-main-trail",
  "S3BucketName": "cc-trail-s3bucket"
  "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents": false,
  "IsMultiRegionTrail": false,
  "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:123456789012:trail/cc-main-trail",
  "LogFileValidationEnabled": false,
  ...
  \}

- Step 3: Change the AWS region by updating the --region command parameter value and repeat step no. 1 and 2 for other regions with active trails enabled. Ensure that only a single region trail records global service events to avoid any duplicate entries within your Amazon CloudTrail aggregated log.
