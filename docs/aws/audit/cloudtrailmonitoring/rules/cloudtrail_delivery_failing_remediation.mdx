### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudTrail service. 

2. In the CloudTrail dashboard, click on "Trails" in the left navigation pane. This will display a list of all the trails in your AWS account.

3. Click on the name of the trail you want to check. This will open the trail's details page.

4. In the trail's details page, check the "Last log file delivery" field. This field shows the time and date of the last successful delivery of log files. If the delivery was successful, the field will show a green checkmark. If the delivery failed, the field will show a red exclamation mark.

#### Using CLI

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. **List Trails**: The first step to check if log files are being delivered without any failures is to list all the trails in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following command: `aws cloudtrail describe-trails`. This command will return a list of all trails along with their configurations.

3. **Get Trail Status**: For each trail returned by the previous command, you need to check its status. You can do this by running the following command: `aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name <trail_name>`. Replace `<trail_name>` with the name of the trail you want to check. This command will return the status of the trail including whether the log file validation is enabled, the time of the last log file delivery, and whether there were any delivery errors.

4. **Check for Delivery Failures**: In the output of the previous command, look for the `LatestDeliveryError` field. If this field is not present or is empty, it means that the log files are being delivered without any failures. If this field contains an error message, it means that there was a failure in delivering the log files.

#### Using Python

1. **Import necessary libraries and establish a session**: First, you need to import the necessary libraries in your Python script. You will need the boto3 library, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. After importing the libraries, establish a session using your AWS credentials.

```python
import boto3
import json

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

2. **Create a CloudTrail client**: After establishing a session, create a CloudTrail client. This client will allow you to interact with the CloudTrail service and fetch the necessary information.

```python
client = session.client('cloudtrail')
```

3. **Fetch and analyze CloudTrail trails**: Now, fetch all the trails in your AWS account and analyze them. You need to check if the "LogFileValidationEnabled" attribute is set to True. If it's not, it means that the log files are not being delivered without any failures.

```python
response = client.describe_trails()

for trail in response['trailList']:
    if not trail['LogFileValidationEnabled']:
        print(f"Trail {trail['Name']} is not delivering log files without any failures.")
```

4. **Handle exceptions**: It's always a good practice to handle exceptions in your scripts. In this case, you might want to handle the case where the CloudTrail service is not available or the credentials are not valid.

```python
try:
    response = client.describe_trails()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This script will print the names of all the trails that are not delivering log files without any failures.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Log files should be delivered without any failures" for AWS using AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudWatch service.

2. Click on "Logs" in the left-hand menu and select the log group that is experiencing the delivery failure.

3. Click on the "Actions" drop-down menu and select "Stream to Amazon Elasticsearch Service".

4. In the "Stream to Amazon Elasticsearch Service" dialog box, select the Elasticsearch domain that you want to stream the log data to.

5. Choose the appropriate IAM role that has permission to stream the log data to the Elasticsearch domain.

6. Configure the log stream settings as required and click on "Start Streaming".

7. Once the log stream is successfully started, CloudWatch will begin delivering log data to the Elasticsearch domain without any failures.

8. You can monitor the log stream status and troubleshoot any issues using the CloudWatch Logs console.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Log files should be delivered without any failures" for AWS using AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Log files Should Be Delivered Without Any Failures" in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or terminal.

2. Run the following command to create a new S3 bucket to store the logs:

   ```
   aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <bucket-name> --region <region> --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=<region>
   ```

   Replace `<bucket-name>` with your desired bucket name and `<region>` with the region in which you want to create the bucket.

3. Run the following command to enable access logging for your S3 bucket:

   ```
   aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --grant-read uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery --grant-write uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery --grant-read-acp uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery --grant-write-acp uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery --grant-full-control uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery
   ```

   Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket you created in step 2.

4. Run the following command to create a new CloudWatch Logs group:

   ```
   aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name <log-group-name>
   ```

   Replace `<log-group-name>` with your desired name for the log group.

5. Run the following command to create a new CloudWatch Logs stream:

   ```
   aws logs create-log-stream --log-group-name <log-group-name> --log-stream-name <log-stream-name>
   ```

   Replace `<log-group-name>` with the name of the log group you created in step 4 and `<log-stream-name>` with your desired name for the log stream.

6. Run the following command to create a new CloudWatch Logs subscription filter:

   ```
   aws logs put-subscription-filter --log-group-name <log-group-name> --filter-name <filter-name> --filter-pattern "" --destination-arn arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>
   ```

   Replace `<log-group-name>` with the name of the log group you created in step 4, `<filter-name>` with your desired name for the filter, and `<bucket-name>` with the name of the S3 bucket you created in step 2.

7. Verify that the logs are being delivered to the S3 bucket by checking the contents of the bucket. You should see log files being created and updated in real-time.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Log files Should Be Delivered Without Any Failures" in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Log files Should Be Delivered Without Any Failures" for AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Create an S3 bucket to store the log files.

```
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'

s3.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
```

Step 2: Create an IAM role with permissions to write to the S3 bucket.

```
import boto3

iam = boto3.client('iam')

role_name = 'your-role-name'

assume_role_policy_document = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "logs.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}

response = iam.create_role(
    RoleName=role_name,
    AssumeRolePolicyDocument=json.dumps(assume_role_policy_document)
)

policy_document = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

iam.put_role_policy(
    RoleName=role_name,
    PolicyName='your-policy-name',
    PolicyDocument=json.dumps(policy_document)
)
```

Step 3: Create a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter to deliver the log files to the S3 bucket.

```
import boto3

logs = boto3.client('logs')

log_group_name = 'your-log-group-name'
filter_name = 'your-filter-name'
destination_arn = 'arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name'

response = logs.put_subscription_filter(
    logGroupName=log_group_name,
    filterName=filter_name,
    filterPattern='',
    destinationArn=destination_arn,
    roleArn='arn:aws:iam::your-account-id:role/your-role-name'
)
```

Note: Replace the placeholders (your-bucket-name, your-role-name, your-policy-name, your-log-group-name, your-filter-name, and your-account-id) with your own values.

These steps will remediate the misconfiguration "Log files Should Be Delivered Without Any Failures" for AWS using Python.
