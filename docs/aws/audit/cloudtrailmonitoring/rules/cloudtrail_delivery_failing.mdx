How to ensure CloudTrail logs are delivered without failure?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
   (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Log files Should Be Delivered Without Any Failures" Policy.)
3. Click on "Trails" in the left navigation pane.
4. Select the trail for which you want to ensure log delivery.
5. In the trail details page, under "Trail details," check the status of the trail. It should be "Enabled" indicating that the trail is active.
6. Ensure that the S3 bucket specified for log delivery is properly configured and accessible. Verify that the bucket exists and has the necessary permissions to receive the CloudTrail logs.
7. Check the CloudTrail event history for any delivery errors or issues. In the trail details page, click on the "Event history" tab and review the events for any failures related to log delivery.
8. Monitor the CloudTrail S3 bucket for new log files. You can periodically check the bucket to ensure that new log files are being generated and delivered. You can also set up S3 bucket notifications or configure CloudWatch Events to trigger notifications or alerts in case of log delivery failures.
9. Review the CloudTrail delivery logs for any error messages or warnings. CloudTrail provides detailed delivery logs that can help you troubleshoot any issues with log delivery. You can access the delivery logs in the S3 bucket specified for log delivery.
10. Enable CloudTrail log file validation to ensure the integrity of log files. Log file validation helps to detect any tampering or modification of the log files during transit. You can enable log file validation in the trail settings.
11. Monitor CloudTrail metrics and alarms. CloudTrail provides various metrics and alarms in CloudWatch that can help you monitor the status and health of log delivery. Set up appropriate CloudWatch alarms to notify you of any log delivery failures or issues.
