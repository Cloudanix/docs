### Remediation

#### Using Console

Here are the steps to remediate the issue of "CloudTrail Logging Buckets Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Login to your AWS account using your credentials.
2. Go to the AWS S3 console.
3. Locate the S3 bucket where your CloudTrail logs are stored.
4. Select the bucket and click on the "Permissions" tab.
5. Under the "Public access" section, check if the "Block public access" setting is enabled. If not, enable it.
6. Click on the "Edit" button next to "Block public access".
7. Enable all four settings under "Block public access" as follows:
   - Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs)
   - Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs)
   - Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies
   - Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies
8. Click on the "Save changes" button.
9. Verify that the "Block public access" settings are enabled and that the bucket is no longer publicly accessible.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of "CloudTrail Logging Buckets Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" in AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of publicly accessible CloudTrail logging buckets in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the S3 buckets available in your AWS account:

```
aws s3api list-buckets
```

3. Identify the CloudTrail logging bucket that is publicly accessible.

4. Run the following command to update the bucket policy for the identified CloudTrail logging bucket:

```
aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> --policy file://policy.json
```

Note: Replace `<bucket-name>` with the actual name of the bucket.

5. Create a policy.json file with the following content:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DenyPublicBucketAccess",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringNotEquals": {
                    "aws:PrincipalOrgID": "<your-organization-ID>"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Note: Replace `<bucket-name>` with the actual name of the bucket and `<your-organization-ID>` with your AWS organization ID.

6. Save the policy.json file.

7. Run the following command to verify that the bucket policy has been updated:

```
aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
```

Note: Replace `<bucket-name>` with the actual name of the bucket.

8. Verify that the CloudTrail logging bucket is no longer publicly accessible.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of publicly accessible CloudTrail logging buckets in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of publicly accessible CloudTrail logging buckets in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Create a boto3 client for S3:

```python
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
```

3. Get a list of all S3 buckets:

```python
response = s3.list_buckets()
buckets = [bucket['Name'] for bucket in response['Buckets']]
```

4. For each bucket, check if it is a CloudTrail logging bucket:

```python
for bucket in buckets:
    try:
        response = s3.get_bucket_tagging(Bucket=bucket)
        tags = response['TagSet']
        for tag in tags:
            if tag['Key'] == 'aws:cloudtrail:arn':
                # This is a CloudTrail logging bucket
                # Check if it is publicly accessible
                response = s3.get_bucket_acl(Bucket=bucket)
                grants = response['Grants']
                for grant in grants:
                    if 'URI' in grant['Grantee'] and grant['Grantee']['URI'] == 'http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers':
                        # The bucket is publicly accessible
                        # Remove the public access
                        s3.put_bucket_acl(Bucket=bucket, ACL='private')
    except ClientError as e:
        if e.response['Error']['Code'] == 'NoSuchTagSet':
            # This bucket does not have any tags
            pass
```

5. Run the script to remediate the issue.

Note: Make sure you have appropriate AWS credentials configured before running the script. Also, this script only checks for CloudTrail logging buckets that have a specific tag. If your CloudTrail logging buckets are not tagged, you will need to modify the script accordingly.
