How to enable MFA Delete protection for CloudTrail logging bucket via AWS CLI?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine, if you haven't already. You can find the installation instructions in the AWS CLI User Guide.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "CloudTrail Logging Bucket Should Use MFA Delete Feature" Policy.)
2. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
3. Run the following command to enable MFA Delete protection for the CloudTrail logging bucket:
   ```
   aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket <bucket-name> --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled --mfa "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:mfa/<mfa-serial-number> <mfa-verification-code>"
   ```
   Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of your CloudTrail logging bucket.
   Replace `<account-id>` with your AWS account ID.
   Replace `<mfa-serial-number>` with the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the MFA device associated with your AWS account.
   Replace `<mfa-verification-code>` with the current verification code from your MFA device.
   Note: MFA Delete protection requires versioning to be enabled for the bucket. This command enables both versioning and MFA Delete protection.
4. After executing the command, AWS will enable MFA Delete protection for the CloudTrail logging bucket. The bucket will now require MFA authentication to delete objects.
Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute the `put-bucket-versioning` command on the CloudTrail logging bucket. You should also have the appropriate IAM permissions to manage MFA Delete protection and access to the MFA device associated with your AWS account.
