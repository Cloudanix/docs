### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/.

2. In the navigation pane, click on "Trails". 

3. In the Trails page, select the trail for which you want to check the configuration.

4. In the details pane, under "Apply trail to all regions", check if it is set to "Yes". If it is set to "No", then CloudTrail is not enabled for all regions, indicating a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```

   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all trails: Once AWS CLI is configured, you can list all trails in your AWS account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail describe-trails
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object that contains information about all trails in your AWS account.

3. Check if CloudTrail is enabled for all regions: To check if CloudTrail is enabled for all regions, you need to look at the "IsMultiRegionTrail" attribute in the JSON object returned by the previous command. If the value of this attribute is "true", then CloudTrail is enabled for all regions. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail describe-trails --query "trailList[*].IsMultiRegionTrail"
   ```

4. Verify the output: If the output of the above command is "true" for all trails, then CloudTrail is enabled for all regions. If any trail has the value "false", then CloudTrail is not enabled for all regions for that particular trail.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and create a session: In your Python script, you need to import the necessary libraries and create a session using your AWS credentials.

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ```

3. Check CloudTrail configuration: Now, you can use the Boto3 library to check the CloudTrail configuration. You need to create a CloudTrail client and then use the `describe_trails` method to get information about all the trails. Then, you can check the `IsMultiRegionTrail` attribute of each trail to see if it is enabled for all regions.

   ```python
   cloudtrail = session.client('cloudtrail')

   response = cloudtrail.describe_trails()

   for trail in response['trailList']:
       if not trail['IsMultiRegionTrail']:
           print(f"CloudTrail {trail['Name']} is not enabled for all regions.")
   ```

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run the script to check the CloudTrail configuration. If there are any trails that are not enabled for all regions, they will be printed out. If all trails are enabled for all regions, nothing will be printed.

   ```bash
   python check_cloudtrail.py
   ```
   
Please replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your actual AWS access key and secret key.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudTrail Must Be Enabled For All Regions" for AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the AWS CloudTrail service homepage.
3. Click on the "Trails" option from the left-hand menu.
4. Select the trail that you want to modify from the list of trails.
5. Click on the "Edit" button.
6. In the "Management events" section, select "All" from the "Apply trail to all regions" dropdown.
7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

This configuration change will enable CloudTrail for all regions in your AWS account.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudTrail Must Be Enabled For All Regions" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to enable CloudTrail in all regions:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail describe-trails --query 'trailList[*].HomeRegion' --output text | xargs -I {} aws cloudtrail update-trail --name {} --is-multi-region-trail
   ```

   This command will use the `describe-trails` operation to get a list of all CloudTrail trails in your account, and then use the `update-trail` operation to enable multi-region support for each trail.

3. Wait for the command to complete and verify that CloudTrail is now enabled for all regions. You can do this by going to the CloudTrail console and checking that there is at least one trail with multi-region support enabled.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "CloudTrail Must Be Enabled For All Regions" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "CloudTrail Must Be Enabled For All Regions" misconfiguration for AWS using Python, you can use the boto3 library to enable CloudTrail in all regions.

Here are the steps to remediate the misconfiguration:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create a boto3 client for CloudTrail:

```python
cloudtrail_client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
```

3. Get a list of all regions using the boto3 client for EC2:

```python
ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
regions = [region['RegionName'] for region in ec2_client.describe_regions()['Regions']]
```

4. Loop through each region and enable CloudTrail:

```python
for region in regions:
    try:
        cloudtrail_client.create_trail(
            Name='my-trail',
            S3BucketName='my-bucket',
            IncludeGlobalServiceEvents=True,
            IsMultiRegionTrail=True,
            EnableLogFileValidation=True,
            CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn='arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:my-log-group:*',
            CloudWatchLogsRoleArn='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-log-role',
            Tags=[
                {
                    'Key': 'my-key',
                    'Value': 'my-value'
                },
            ]
        )
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error enabling CloudTrail in {region}: {e}")
```

This code will create a CloudTrail trail in each region with the specified settings. If a trail already exists in a region, it will throw an error which will be caught and printed to the console.

Note: You will need to replace the S3BucketName, CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn, CloudWatchLogsRoleArn, and Tags values with your own values.
