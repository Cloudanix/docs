<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "CloudTrail Must Be Enabled For All Regions" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to enable CloudTrail in all regions:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail describe-trails --query 'trailList[*].HomeRegion' --output text | xargs -I {} aws cloudtrail update-trail --name {} --is-multi-region-trail
   ```

   This command will use the `describe-trails` operation to get a list of all CloudTrail trails in your account, and then use the `update-trail` operation to enable multi-region support for each trail.

3. Wait for the command to complete and verify that CloudTrail is now enabled for all regions. You can do this by going to the CloudTrail console and checking that there is at least one trail with multi-region support enabled.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "CloudTrail Must Be Enabled For All Regions" for AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the "CloudTrail Must Be Enabled For All Regions" misconfiguration for AWS using Python, you can use the boto3 library to enable CloudTrail in all regions.

Here are the steps to remediate the misconfiguration:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create a boto3 client for CloudTrail:

```python
cloudtrail_client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
```

3. Get a list of all regions using the boto3 client for EC2:

```python
ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
regions = [region['RegionName'] for region in ec2_client.describe_regions()['Regions']]
```

4. Loop through each region and enable CloudTrail:

```python
for region in regions:
    try:
        cloudtrail_client.create_trail(
            Name='my-trail',
            S3BucketName='my-bucket',
            IncludeGlobalServiceEvents=True,
            IsMultiRegionTrail=True,
            EnableLogFileValidation=True,
            CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn='arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:my-log-group:*',
            CloudWatchLogsRoleArn='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-log-role',
            Tags=[
                {
                    'Key': 'my-key',
                    'Value': 'my-value'
                },
            ]
        )
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error enabling CloudTrail in {region}: {e}")
```

This code will create a CloudTrail trail in each region with the specified settings. If a trail already exists in a region, it will throw an error which will be caught and printed to the console.

Note: You will need to replace the S3BucketName, CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn, CloudWatchLogsRoleArn, and Tags values with your own values.
