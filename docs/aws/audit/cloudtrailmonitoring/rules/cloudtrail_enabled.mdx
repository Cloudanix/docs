1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the CloudTrail service by selecting "CloudTrail" from the services menu.
3. In the CloudTrail dashboard, click on the "Trails" tab.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "CloudTrail Must Be Enabled For All Regions" Policy.)
4. Click on the "Create trail" button to create a new CloudTrail trail.
5. In the "Create trail" page, provide a name for the trail in the "Trail name" field.
6. Specify the S3 bucket where you want to store the CloudTrail logs in the "S3 bucket" field. If you don't have an existing S3 bucket, you can create one by clicking on the "Create a new S3 bucket" button.
7. Under the "Apply trail to all regions" section, select the checkbox to enable the trail for all regions.
8. In the "Management events" section, choose the specific management events you want to log. You can select the desired options based on your requirements.
9. Optionally, you can configure advanced settings such as data events, event selectors, and storage settings as per your needs.
10. Scroll down to the "Create trail" button and click on it to create the trail.
11. AWS will start creating the trail for all regions. It may take a few minutes for the trail creation process to complete.
12. Once the trail creation is successful, CloudTrail logging will be enabled for all AWS regions, and the logs will be stored in the specified S3 bucket.
