To ensure that AWS CloudTrail records both regional and global events using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to CloudTrail Console:**
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Open the CloudTrail console by searching for "CloudTrail" in the AWS services search bar and selecting it.

2. **Select or Create a Trail:**
   - If you already have a trail, select it from the list of trails.
   - If you do not have a trail, click on "Create trail" to set up a new one.

3. **Configure Trail Settings:**
   - In the trail settings, ensure that the "Management events" section is expanded.
   - Check the box for "Read/Write events" to include both read and write management events.

4. **Enable Global Events:**
   - Scroll down to the "Advanced" section.
   - Ensure that the option "Include global services events" is checked. This ensures that global service events (like IAM) are recorded in addition to regional events.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your CloudTrail configuration captures both regional and global events, providing comprehensive logging for your AWS environment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To ensure that AWS CloudTrail records both regional and global events using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create or Update a CloudTrail Trail:**
   Ensure you have a CloudTrail trail that is configured to log both management and data events. If you don't have a trail, create one. If you already have a trail, you can update it.

   ```sh
   aws cloudtrail create-trail --name my-trail --s3-bucket-name my-bucket
   ```

2. **Enable Logging for Global Services:**
   Update the trail to include global service events (e.g., IAM, STS, CloudFront).

   ```sh
   aws cloudtrail update-trail --name my-trail --include-global-service-events
   ```

3. **Enable Multi-Region Trail:**
   Ensure the trail is configured to log events from all regions.

   ```sh
   aws cloudtrail update-trail --name my-trail --is-multi-region-trail
   ```

4. **Start Logging:**
   Start logging for the trail to ensure that events are being recorded.

   ```sh
   aws cloudtrail start-logging --name my-trail
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your CloudTrail is configured to record both regional and global events.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To ensure that AWS CloudTrail records both regional and global events using Python scripts, you can use the `boto3` library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Install Boto3 Library**:
   Ensure you have the `boto3` library installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**:
   Initialize the `boto3` client for CloudTrail.

3. **Create or Update CloudTrail**:
   Create a new CloudTrail or update an existing one to ensure it records both regional and global events.

4. **Verify Configuration**:
   Verify that the CloudTrail configuration includes both regional and global events.

Here is a Python script to achieve this:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize a session using Amazon CloudTrail
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'  # Specify your region
)

# Initialize CloudTrail client
cloudtrail_client = session.client('cloudtrail')

# Define the trail name
trail_name = 'your-trail-name'

# Create or update the CloudTrail to record both regional and global events
try:
    response = cloudtrail_client.update_trail(
        Name=trail_name,
        IncludeGlobalServiceEvents=True
    )
    print(f"Successfully updated trail {trail_name} to include global service events.")
except cloudtrail_client.exceptions.TrailNotFoundException:
    response = cloudtrail_client.create_trail(
        Name=trail_name,
        S3BucketName='your-s3-bucket-name',  # Specify your S3 bucket name
        IncludeGlobalServiceEvents=True,
        IsMultiRegionTrail=True
    )
    print(f"Successfully created trail {trail_name} with global service events included.")

# Verify the configuration
trail_status = cloudtrail_client.get_trail_status(Name=trail_name)
if trail_status['IsLogging']:
    print(f"Trail {trail_name} is logging.")
else:
    print(f"Trail {trail_name} is not logging.")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Install Boto3 Library**:
   - Ensure you have the `boto3` library installed to interact with AWS services.

2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**:
   - Initialize a session and CloudTrail client using your AWS credentials and region.

3. **Create or Update CloudTrail**:
   - Use `update_trail` to modify an existing trail to include global service events.
   - If the trail does not exist, use `create_trail` to create a new trail with the required settings.

4. **Verify Configuration**:
   - Check the trail status to ensure it is logging events.

This script ensures that your CloudTrail is configured to record both regional and global events, preventing the misconfiguration.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/.

2. In the navigation pane, click on "Trails". 

3. In the Trails page, select the trail you want to check. 

4. In the details pane, under "S3", check the "Log file SSE-KMS encryption" field. If it is set to "Yes", then the trail is recording both regional and global events. If it is set to "No", then the trail is not recording global events.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access CloudTrail.

2. Once AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can use the following command to list all the trails:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail describe-trails
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the trails.

3. To check if a trail is recording both regional and global events, you need to look at the 'IncludeGlobalServiceEvents' and 'IsMultiRegionTrail' fields in the output. If 'IncludeGlobalServiceEvents' is true, it means the trail is recording global events. If 'IsMultiRegionTrail' is true, it means the trail is recording events from all regions.

4. You can use the following command to filter the output and check these fields for all trails:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail describe-trails --query 'trailList[*].[Name,IncludeGlobalServiceEvents,IsMultiRegionTrail]'
   ```
   This command will return a list of all trails with their names and the values of 'IncludeGlobalServiceEvents' and 'IsMultiRegionTrail'. If any trail has 'false' for either of these fields, it means it is not recording both regional and global events.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing Python scripts to interact with AWS, you need to install the necessary libraries. The primary library you need is boto3, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to interact with AWS services. You can set them in your environment variables:

   ```python
   import os
   os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] = 'your_access_key'
   os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check if CloudTrail is recording both regional and global events: 

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_cloudtrail_recording():
       client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
       response = client.describe_trails()
       for trail in response['trailList']:
           if 'IsMultiRegionTrail' in trail:
               if trail['IsMultiRegionTrail']:
                   print(f"Trail {trail['Name']} is recording both regional and global events.")
               else:
                   print(f"Trail {trail['Name']} is not recording both regional and global events.")
           else:
               print(f"Trail {trail['Name']} does not have the 'IsMultiRegionTrail' attribute.")

   check_cloudtrail_recording()
   ```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using any Python interpreter. The script will print out the names of all trails and whether they are recording both regional and global events. If a trail does not have the 'IsMultiRegionTrail' attribute, it means that it is not configured to record events in all regions.
