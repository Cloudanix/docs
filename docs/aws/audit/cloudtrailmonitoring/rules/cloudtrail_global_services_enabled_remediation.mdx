<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt and ensure that you have AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS account credentials.

2. Run the following command to create a trail with the required settings:

```
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <trail-name> --s3-bucket-name <bucket-name> --include-global-service-events
```

Replace `<trail-name>` with a name for your trail and `<bucket-name>` with the name of the S3 bucket where you want to store your trail logs.

3. If you already have a trail created, you can update it to include global service events using the following command:

```
aws cloudtrail update-trail --name <trail-name> --include-global-service-events
```

Replace `<trail-name>` with the name of your existing trail.

4. Verify that your trail is recording both regional and global events by running the following command:

```
aws cloudtrail describe-trails --trail-name-list <trail-name>
```

This command will return the details of your trail, including the settings for recording regional and global events.

By following these steps, you will have remediated the misconfiguration and ensured that your AWS trail is recording both regional and global events.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Trails Should Record Both Regional And Global Events" for AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudTrail service.

2. Select the trail that needs to be updated and click on "Edit".

3. In the "Event selectors" section, click on "Add event selector".

4. In the "Create event selector" page, select "All events" under "Event selector type".

5. Select the regions for which you want to record events. You can select individual regions or select "All regions" to record events from all regions.

6. Select "Global services" to record events from global services.

7. Click on "Add event selector" to save the changes.

8. To automate this process using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).

9. Install Boto3 using the command "pip install boto3".

10. Write a Python script that uses the Boto3 library to update the CloudTrail trail.

11. Use the "update_trail" method of the "cloudtrail" client to update the trail.

12. Set the "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents" parameter to "True" to record events from global services.

13. Set the "EventSelectors" parameter to include all regions.

14. Save the script and run it to update the trail.

Here is a sample code to update a CloudTrail trail using Python and Boto3:

```
import boto3

# Create a CloudTrail client
client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')

# Update the trail
response = client.update_trail(
    Name='my-trail',
    IncludeGlobalServiceEvents=True,
    EventSelectors=[
        {
            'ReadWriteType': 'All',
            'IncludeManagementEvents': True,
            'DataResources': [
                {
                    'Type': 'AWS::S3::Object',
                    'Values': [
                        'arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*'
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

Note: Replace "my-trail" with the name of your trail and "my-bucket" with the name of your S3 bucket. Also, modify the "EventSelectors" parameter to include all regions.
