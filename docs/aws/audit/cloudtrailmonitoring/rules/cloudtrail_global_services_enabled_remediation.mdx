<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/.

2. In the navigation pane, click on "Trails". 

3. In the Trails page, select the trail you want to check. 

4. In the details pane, under "S3", check the "Log file SSE-KMS encryption" field. If it is set to "Yes", then the trail is recording both regional and global events. If it is set to "No", then the trail is not recording global events.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access CloudTrail.

2. Once AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can use the following command to list all the trails:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail describe-trails
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the trails.

3. To check if a trail is recording both regional and global events, you need to look at the 'IncludeGlobalServiceEvents' and 'IsMultiRegionTrail' fields in the output. If 'IncludeGlobalServiceEvents' is true, it means the trail is recording global events. If 'IsMultiRegionTrail' is true, it means the trail is recording events from all regions.

4. You can use the following command to filter the output and check these fields for all trails:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail describe-trails --query 'trailList[*].[Name,IncludeGlobalServiceEvents,IsMultiRegionTrail]'
   ```
   This command will return a list of all trails with their names and the values of 'IncludeGlobalServiceEvents' and 'IsMultiRegionTrail'. If any trail has 'false' for either of these fields, it means it is not recording both regional and global events.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing Python scripts to interact with AWS, you need to install the necessary libraries. The primary library you need is boto3, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to interact with AWS services. You can set them in your environment variables:

   ```python
   import os
   os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] = 'your_access_key'
   os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check if CloudTrail is recording both regional and global events: 

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_cloudtrail_recording():
       client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
       response = client.describe_trails()
       for trail in response['trailList']:
           if 'IsMultiRegionTrail' in trail:
               if trail['IsMultiRegionTrail']:
                   print(f"Trail {trail['Name']} is recording both regional and global events.")
               else:
                   print(f"Trail {trail['Name']} is not recording both regional and global events.")
           else:
               print(f"Trail {trail['Name']} does not have the 'IsMultiRegionTrail' attribute.")

   check_cloudtrail_recording()
   ```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using any Python interpreter. The script will print out the names of all trails and whether they are recording both regional and global events. If a trail does not have the 'IsMultiRegionTrail' attribute, it means that it is not configured to record events in all regions.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Trails Should Record Both Regional And Global Events" for AWS using AWS console, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudTrail service.

2. Select the trail that you want to update.

3. Click on the "Edit" button.

4. In the "Event selectors" section, make sure that "All" is selected under "Data events".

5. Under "Management events", select "Global services" and "Regional services".

6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

7. Verify that the trail is now recording both regional and global events by checking the "Event history" tab for the trail.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Trails Should Record Both Regional And Global Events" for AWS using AWS console.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt and ensure that you have AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS account credentials.

2. Run the following command to create a trail with the required settings:

```
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <trail-name> --s3-bucket-name <bucket-name> --include-global-service-events
```

Replace `<trail-name>` with a name for your trail and `<bucket-name>` with the name of the S3 bucket where you want to store your trail logs.

3. If you already have a trail created, you can update it to include global service events using the following command:

```
aws cloudtrail update-trail --name <trail-name> --include-global-service-events
```

Replace `<trail-name>` with the name of your existing trail.

4. Verify that your trail is recording both regional and global events by running the following command:

```
aws cloudtrail describe-trails --trail-name-list <trail-name>
```

This command will return the details of your trail, including the settings for recording regional and global events.

By following these steps, you will have remediated the misconfiguration and ensured that your AWS trail is recording both regional and global events.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Trails Should Record Both Regional And Global Events" for AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudTrail service.

2. Select the trail that needs to be updated and click on "Edit".

3. In the "Event selectors" section, click on "Add event selector".

4. In the "Create event selector" page, select "All events" under "Event selector type".

5. Select the regions for which you want to record events. You can select individual regions or select "All regions" to record events from all regions.

6. Select "Global services" to record events from global services.

7. Click on "Add event selector" to save the changes.

8. To automate this process using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).

9. Install Boto3 using the command "pip install boto3".

10. Write a Python script that uses the Boto3 library to update the CloudTrail trail.

11. Use the "update_trail" method of the "cloudtrail" client to update the trail.

12. Set the "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents" parameter to "True" to record events from global services.

13. Set the "EventSelectors" parameter to include all regions.

14. Save the script and run it to update the trail.

Here is a sample code to update a CloudTrail trail using Python and Boto3:

```
import boto3

# Create a CloudTrail client
client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')

# Update the trail
response = client.update_trail(
    Name='my-trail',
    IncludeGlobalServiceEvents=True,
    EventSelectors=[
        {
            'ReadWriteType': 'All',
            'IncludeManagementEvents': True,
            'DataResources': [
                {
                    'Type': 'AWS::S3::Object',
                    'Values': [
                        'arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*'
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

Note: Replace "my-trail" with the name of your trail and "my-bucket" with the name of your S3 bucket. Also, modify the "EventSelectors" parameter to include all regions.
