How to enable Object lock feature in CloudTrail?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
2. Find and select the S3 bucket used for storing CloudTrail logs.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Object Lock Feature Should Be Enabled" Policy.)
3. Click on the "Properties" tab in the bucket details view.
4. Scroll down to the "Object lock" section and click on the "Edit" button.
5. In the "Object lock" dialog, select the "Enable object lock" option.
6. Choose the desired Object Lock retention mode based on your requirements:
   - "Governance" mode allows you to set retention periods and provides flexibility for object deletion by authorized users.
   - "Compliance" mode enforces a write-once-read-many (WORM) policy, ensuring objects are locked and cannot be deleted or modified until the retention period expires.
7. Set the desired retention period for the Object Lock feature. This defines the duration for which the objects in the bucket will remain locked.
8. Optionally, specify a default retention period for new objects or specify individual retention periods for specific objects.
9. Click the "Save" button to enable the Object Lock feature for the bucket.
