How to reconfigure Amazon CloudTrail trail to use the designated S3 bucket?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: Sign in to your Cloud Conformity console, access CloudTrail S3 Bucket rule settings and copy the name of the Amazon S3 bucket configured to receive and store CloudTrail data.

- Step 2: Inside AWS Console, Go to CloudTrail dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/.

- Step 3: In the navigation panel, select Trails. Choose the CloudTrail trail that you want to reconfigure.
  (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource) then click on its identifier to access the trail configuration page.

- Step 4: On the selected trail configuration page, click the Edit icon available next to the Storage location section to reconfigure the target bucket associated with the trail.

- Step 5: Select Yes next to Create a new S3 bucket, and within S3 bucket box type the name of the designated bucket, defined in the conformity rule settings and copied at step no. 1. (Optional) You can also specify a prefix for the log files in the Log file prefix box.

- Step 6: Click Save to apply the changes. Once the target bucket is created, Amazon CloudTrail service will begin to deliver trail data to the designated bucket and the Last log file delivered attribute value set for the selected trail will be updated.
