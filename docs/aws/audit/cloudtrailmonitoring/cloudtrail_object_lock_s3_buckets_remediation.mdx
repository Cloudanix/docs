How to enable Object lock feature in CloudTrail?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: Choose Create bucket from the console top menu to create a new Amazon S3 bucket. On the Create bucket setup page, perform the following operations:
  A: For General configuration:
  a. Provide a unique name for your new S3 bucket in the Bucket name box.
  b. From the AWS Region dropdown list, select the AWS cloud region where the new S3 bucket will be created (must match the region of the associated bucket).
  c. Choose bucket under Copy settings from existing bucket, select the source (associated) S3 bucket, and Choose bucket.

  B: For Block Public Access settings for bucket, select Block all public access to ensure that all public access to this bucket and its objects is blocked. For more details about this feature, see this conformity rule.

  C: For Bucket Versioning, choose Enable to enable bucket versioning for the new bucket. Amazon S3 Object Lock requires S3 object versioning.

  D: (Optional) For Tags, use the Add tag button to create and apply user-defined tags to the S3 bucket. You can track storage cost and other criteria by tagging your bucket.

  E: For Default encryption, select Enable under Server-side encryption, and choose one of the encryption key types available, based on your requirements. For more details about Amazon S3 Server-Side Encryption (SSE), see this conformity rule.

  F: For Advanced settings, choose Enable under Object Lock to enable the Object Lock feature. To confirm, check the box marked: I acknowledge that enabling Object Lock will permanently allow objects in this bucket to be locked.

  G: Choose Create bucket to create your new Amazon S3 bucket.

- Step 2: Click on the name of the newly created Amazon S3 bucket. Select the Properties tab from the console menu to access the bucket properties.

- Step 3: In the Object Lock section, choose Edit to configure the feature settings available for the S3 objects that are uploaded without Object Lock configuration.

- Step 4: Within the Object Lock configuration section, choose Enable under Default retention and select one of the following default retention modes. These retention modes apply different levels of protection to the objects within the selected bucket:
  A: Select Governance so that users cannot overwrite or delete an S3 object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions (e.g. root account). Governance mode enables you to protect objects against deletion by most users while still allowing you to grant some users permission to alter the retention settings or delete the object if required. In the Default retention period box, enter the number of days required to protect an object version. Click Save changes to apply the changes.

  B: Select Compliance so that a protected object version cannot be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root account user. Once an S3 object is locked in Compliance mode, its retention mode cannot be reconfigured and its retention period cannot be shortened. This retention mode ensures that an object version can't be overwritten or deleted for the duration of the retention period, specified in the Default retention period box. Click Save changes to apply the configuration changes.

- Step 5: Go to the Amazon CloudTrail console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/.

- Step 6: In the navigation panel, under CloudTrail, choose Trails. Click on the name of the Amazon CloudTrail trail that you want to reconfigure.

- Step 7: In the General details section choose Edit to change the configuration settings available for the selected trail.

- Step 8: On the Edit trail configuration page, choose Browse under Trail log bucket name, select the newly created S3 bucket, and click Choose. (Optional) You can also specify a prefix for the log files in the Prefix â€“ optional box. Choose Save changes to apply the changes. Once the configuration changes are applied, Amazon CloudTrail service will begin to deliver trail data to the associated S3 bucket, which is now protected with the Object Lock feature.
