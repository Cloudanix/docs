How to update Amazon ElasticSearch clusters permissions to allow cross-account access from trusted entities?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: Click on the ES domain you want to reconfigure (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource). On the selected domain description page, click the Modify access policy button from the dashboard menu to access the domain policy.

- Step 2: On the Modify the access policy for DOMAIN NAME page, in the Add or edit the access policy section, replace the existing (untrusted) AWS identifier(s) defined as the Principal element value(s) with the trusted one(s), available on Cloud Conformity console.

- Step 3: In the Change your access policy dialog box, click OK to update the policy. Then click Submit.

- Step 4: The Elasticsearch domain status should change from Active to Processing. The status should return to Active before your modified access policy takes effect.
