### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Elasticsearch service. 

2. In the Elasticsearch dashboard, click on "Reserved Instances" in the left-hand navigation pane. 

3. In the Reserved Instances page, you will see a list of all your reserved instances. Look for the "Status" column in the list. 

4. Check the status of each reserved instance. If any of them have the status "Payment Pending", it means that the payment for that reserved instance is not yet complete.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instances" command to list all the Elasticsearch reserved instances. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws es describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instances
   ```

3. This command will return a JSON output with details about all the Elasticsearch reserved instances. You need to check the "State" field in the output. If the value of the "State" field is "payment-pending", it means that the payment for the reserved instance is pending.

4. To filter out the instances with payment pending status, you can use the "jq" command-line JSON processor. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws es describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instances | jq '.ReservedElasticsearchInstances[] | select(.State=="payment-pending")'
   ```

This command will return the details of the Elasticsearch reserved instances that have the status "payment-pending".

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the boto3 library. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Configure AWS credentials: Before you can interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a credentials file at ~/.aws/credentials. At a minimum, the credentials file should specify the access key and secret access key. To specify these for the default profile, you can use the following format:

```python
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

3. Write a Python script to check the status of Elasticsearch Reserved Instances:

```python
import boto3

def check_es_reserved_instance_status():
    client = boto3.client('es')

    response = client.describe_reserved_elasticsearch_instances()

    for instance in response['ReservedElasticsearchInstances']:
        if instance['State'] == 'payment-pending':
            print(f"Elasticsearch Reserved Instance {instance['ReservedElasticsearchInstanceId']} has status Payment Pending")

check_es_reserved_instance_status()
```

This script will print out the IDs of any Elasticsearch Reserved Instances that have a status of Payment Pending.

4. Run the Python script: You can run the script using any Python interpreter. Make sure to replace YOUR_ACCESS_KEY and YOUR_SECRET_KEY with your actual AWS access key and secret access key. If any Elasticsearch Reserved Instances have a status of Payment Pending, their IDs will be printed out.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance Payment Pending misconfiguration in AWS:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Elasticsearch service.

2. Click on the "Reserved instances" tab in the left-hand menu.

3. Locate the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance with the "Payment Pending" status.

4. Click on the "Actions" button for that instance.

5. Select "Modify Reserved Instance" from the dropdown menu.

6. In the "Modify Reserved Instance" dialog box, select the "Apply RI upfront" option.

7. Choose the payment option that you prefer, either "All Upfront" or "Partial Upfront".

8. Review the details of the reservation and click "Purchase".

9. Wait for the payment to be processed. Once the payment is processed, the instance status will change from "Payment Pending" to "Active".

That's it! You have successfully remediated the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance Payment Pending misconfiguration in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance with a payment pending status in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Check the status of your Elasticsearch Reserved Instance by running the following command:

   ```
   aws es describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instances
   ```

3. Identify the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance with a payment pending status.

4. Modify the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance by running the following command:

   ```
   aws es modify-reserved-elasticsearch-instances --reserved-elasticsearch-instance-id <your-reserved-instance-id> --payment-option AllUpfront
   ```

   Note: Replace `<your-reserved-instance-id>` with the ID of the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance that has a payment pending status.

5. Verify that the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance status has changed to active by running the following command:

   ```
   aws es describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instances
   ```

6. If the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance status has not changed to active, contact AWS Support for further assistance.

By following these steps, you can remediate the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance with a payment pending status in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance with status "Payment Pending" in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDKs and libraries in your Python script, such as `boto3` and `botocore`.

2. Create an AWS client for Elasticsearch using the `boto3.client()` method.

```python
import boto3

es = boto3.client('es')
```

3. Use the `describe_reserved_elasticsearch_instances()` method to get the details of all the reserved Elasticsearch instances in your AWS account.

```python
reserved_instances = es.describe_reserved_elasticsearch_instances()
```

4. Loop through the reserved instances and check for the ones with the status "Payment Pending".

```python
for instance in reserved_instances['ReservedElasticsearchInstances']:
    if instance['State'] == 'payment-pending':
        # remediation steps go here
```

5. To remediate the instance, you can modify the payment option for the reserved instance using the `modify_reserved_elasticsearch_instance()` method.

```python
es.modify_reserved_elasticsearch_instance(
    ReservedElasticsearchInstanceId='instance-id',
    PaymentOption='AllUpfront'
)
```

6. Once the payment option is modified, check the status of the reserved instance again using the `describe_reserved_elasticsearch_instances()` method to ensure that the status has been updated.

```python
reserved_instances = es.describe_reserved_elasticsearch_instances()

for instance in reserved_instances['ReservedElasticsearchInstances']:
    if instance['ReservedElasticsearchInstanceId'] == 'instance-id':
        if instance['State'] != 'payment-pending':
            print('Reserved instance status updated successfully')
```

7. Finally, test the remediation by verifying the status of the reserved instance in the AWS Management Console or by using the `describe_reserved_elasticsearch_instances()` method again.

Note: Make sure that you have the necessary permissions to modify reserved Elasticsearch instances in your AWS account.
