### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the Elasticsearch free storage space issue in AWS, follow these steps:

1. Login to your AWS console and navigate to the Elasticsearch service.

2. Select the Elasticsearch domain that you want to remediate.

3. Click on the "Modify" button.

4. Scroll down to the "EBS Volume" section.

5. Increase the "EBS Volume Size" to provide more storage space.

6. Click on the "Save Changes" button.

7. Wait for the Elasticsearch domain to update and the new storage space to be available.

8. Verify that the Elasticsearch domain now has free storage space by checking the Elasticsearch dashboard or running a query.

Note: Increasing the EBS Volume Size will result in additional charges on your AWS bill.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the Elasticsearch misconfiguration of not having free storage space in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or use the AWS CLI in the AWS Management Console.

2. Run the following command to list all the Elasticsearch domains in your AWS account:

```
aws es list-domain-names
```

3. Identify the Elasticsearch domain that has the misconfiguration of not having free storage space.

4. Run the following command to update the Elasticsearch domain configuration and set the storage type to EBS and the EBS volume size to a value greater than the current storage usage:

```
aws es update-elasticsearch-domain-config --domain-name <domain-name> --ebs-options EBSEnabled=true,VolumeSize=<new-volume-size>
```

Replace `<domain-name>` with the name of the Elasticsearch domain and `<new-volume-size>` with the desired EBS volume size in gigabytes.

5. Wait for the Elasticsearch domain to be updated. This may take several minutes.

6. Run the following command to verify that the Elasticsearch domain has free storage space:

```
aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain --domain-name <domain-name> --query 'DomainStatus.EBSOptions.VolumeSize'
```

This command should return a value greater than the current storage usage.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 for any other Elasticsearch domains that have the misconfiguration of not having free storage space.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the Elasticsearch misconfiguration of not having free storage space in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the Elasticsearch misconfiguration of not having free storage space in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary Python modules:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Initialize a boto3 Elasticsearch client:

```python
es = boto3.client('es')
```

3. Get the Elasticsearch domain name:

```python
domain_name = 'your_domain_name'
```

4. Get the Elasticsearch domain configuration:

```python
domain_config = es.describe_elasticsearch_domain(DomainName=domain_name)
```

5. Get the current storage space usage:

```python
storage_used = domain_config['DomainStatus']['EBSOptions']['VolumeSize'] - domain_config['DomainStatus']['EBSOptions']['FreeSpace']
```

6. Get the maximum storage space limit:

```python
storage_limit = domain_config['DomainStatus']['EBSOptions']['VolumeSize']
```

7. Calculate the required free storage space:

```python
required_free_space = int(storage_limit * 0.2) # 20% of total storage limit
```

8. If the current storage space usage is greater than or equal to the required free storage space, then increase the storage limit:

```python
if storage_used >= required_free_space:
    new_storage_limit = storage_limit + required_free_space
    es.update_elasticsearch_domain_config(DomainName=domain_name, EBSOptions={'EBSEnabled': True, 'VolumeSize': new_storage_limit})
```

9. Print a message indicating whether the storage limit was increased:

```python
if storage_used >= required_free_space:
    print(f"The storage limit for Elasticsearch domain {domain_name} has been increased to {new_storage_limit} GB.")
else:
    print(f"The Elasticsearch domain {domain_name} has sufficient free storage space.")
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the Elasticsearch misconfiguration of not having free storage space in AWS using Python.
