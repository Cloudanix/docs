title: Elasticsearch Should Have Free Storage Space
---

### More Info:

Scale up any Amazon ElasticSearch (ES) clusters that appear to run low on disk space to help mitigate any issues.

### Risk Level

High

### Remediation

How to remediate if ElasticSearch clusters are running out of free storage space

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon Elasticsearch service.
   (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Elasticsearch Should Have Free Storage Space" Policy.)
3. Select the Elasticsearch domain for which you want to address the storage space issue.
4. In the domain details page, go to the "Indices" tab.
5. Review the indices listed and identify any indices that are consuming a significant amount of storage space.
6. Determine if there are any unnecessary or unused indices that can be deleted to free up storage space. Carefully evaluate the impact of deleting indices before proceeding.
7. Delete any unnecessary indices by clicking on the index name and selecting the "Delete index" option. Confirm the deletion when prompted.
8. If you need to retain the data but reduce the storage space, consider using index shrinking or reindexing techniques to optimize the data storage.
9. Analyze the indexing and search patterns of your Elasticsearch cluster. Identify any sources of excessive indexing or inefficient queries that may be contributing to rapid storage consumption.
10. Optimize your indexing and search processes to reduce unnecessary data ingestion and improve query performance. Consider implementing index lifecycle policies (ILM) to manage data retention and rollover strategies effectively.
11. Monitor the storage utilization of your Elasticsearch cluster regularly. Set up CloudWatch alarms to alert you when the storage space reaches a critical threshold.
12. Consider scaling up your Elasticsearch cluster by adding more data nodes or increasing the instance size to accommodate higher storage requirements.
13. If your cluster is using Amazon EBS volumes for storage, consider resizing the volumes to increase the available storage capacity.
14. Review and optimize the Elasticsearch index settings, such as shard configuration, to ensure efficient storage utilization.
15. If necessary, consider archiving or offloading older data to a different storage solution, such as Amazon S3 or Amazon Glacier, to free up space in your Elasticsearch cluster.
