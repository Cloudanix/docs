How to encrypt an existing AWS ElasticSearch domain?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Amazon Elasticsearch Service by selecting "Elasticsearch Service" from the services menu.
3. In the Amazon Elasticsearch Service dashboard, click on the name of the Elasticsearch domain that you want to enable encryption for.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "ElasticSearch Domains Should Be Encrypted" Policy.)
4. In the domain details page, click on the "Actions" button and select "Modify domain."
5. Scroll down to the "Encryption" section and click on the "Edit" button.
6. In the encryption settings, select the "Enable" option to enable encryption.
7. Choose the encryption key management service (KMS) key that you want to use for encryption. You can select an existing KMS key or create a new one.
8. If you choose to create a new KMS key, provide the necessary details and follow the instructions to create the key. Otherwise, select an existing KMS key from the dropdown list.
9. Once you have selected the KMS key, click on the "Save changes" button to enable encryption for the Elasticsearch domain.
10. AWS will start applying the encryption settings to the domain. This process may take a few minutes to complete.
11. After the encryption settings are successfully applied, the Elasticsearch domain will be encrypted using the specified KMS key.
