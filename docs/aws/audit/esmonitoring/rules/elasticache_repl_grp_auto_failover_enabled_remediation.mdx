### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the ElastiCache dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Redis" to open the Redis dashboard.

3. In the list of Redis clusters, choose the name of the cluster that you want to examine.

4. In the details pane, under the "Details" tab, look for the "Automatic Failover" field. If the value of this field is "disabled", then the automatic failover feature is not enabled for the selected Redis cluster.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all ElastiCache clusters: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all your ElastiCache clusters:

   ```
   aws elasticache describe-cache-clusters --show-cache-node-info
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with information about all your ElastiCache clusters.

3. Check the 'Automatic Failover' status: In the JSON output, look for the 'AutomaticFailover' field. This field indicates whether or not automatic failover is enabled for the ElastiCache cluster. If the value of this field is 'enabled', then automatic failover is enabled. If the value is 'disabled', then automatic failover is not enabled.

4. Repeat the process for all clusters: You need to repeat steps 2 and 3 for all your ElastiCache clusters. If you find any cluster with 'AutomaticFailover' set to 'disabled', then it means that automatic failover is not enabled for that cluster.

#### Using Python

To check if Automatic Failover is enabled for AWS ElastiCache clusters using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to directly interact with AWS services, including ElastiCache. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the Boto3 library in Python:**
   Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using pip:
   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set up AWS credentials and region for Boto3:**
   You can set AWS credentials by creating the credentials file yourself. By default, its location is at `~/.aws/credentials`. At a minimum, the credentials file should look like this:
   ```python
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```
   Then, configure your default region by editing the AWS config file. By default, its location is at `~/.aws/config`:
   ```python
   [default]
   region=us-east-1
   ```

3. **Create a Python script to interact with AWS ElastiCache:**
   Use the Boto3 library to create a client for AWS ElastiCache and then use the `describe_replication_groups` method to retrieve information about the ElastiCache clusters. Check the `AutomaticFailover` field for each cluster. If it's set to 'enabled', then Automatic Failover is enabled. If it's set to 'disabled', then Automatic Failover is not enabled.
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a client for ElastiCache
   elasticache = boto3.client('elasticache')

   # Describe all replication groups
   response = elasticache.describe_replication_groups()

   # Iterate over each replication group
   for group in response['ReplicationGroups']:
       # Check if Automatic Failover is enabled
       if group['AutomaticFailover'] != 'enabled':
           print(f"Automatic Failover is not enabled for the cluster: {group['ReplicationGroupId']}")
   ```

4. **Run the Python script:**
   Execute the Python script. If there are any ElastiCache clusters with Automatic Failover not enabled, they will be printed out. If no output is returned, it means that Automatic Failover is enabled for all ElastiCache clusters.

Please note that this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to access and list the ElastiCache clusters. If you don't, you'll need to adjust your IAM policies accordingly.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Elasticache Automatic Failover not being enabled for AWS ElastiCache using the AWS Management Console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Access AWS Management Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console at https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to ElastiCache Dashboard**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top left corner of the console and select "ElastiCache" under the "Database" section.

3. **Select Redis Cluster**: In the ElastiCache dashboard, select the Redis cluster for which you want to enable automatic failover.

4. **Modify the Cluster**: Click on the name of the Redis cluster to access its details. In the cluster details page, click on the "Modify" button at the top.

5. **Enable Automatic Failover**: Scroll down to the "Advanced Redis settings" section in the modify cluster settings page. Look for the "Automatic Failover" option and set it to "Enabled".

6. **Review and Apply Changes**: Review the other settings to ensure they are correct. Once you have confirmed that automatic failover is enabled and other settings are as desired, click on the "Modify" button at the bottom of the page.

7. **Monitor the Cluster**: After modifying the cluster settings, monitor the cluster to ensure that the changes have been successfully applied. You can do this by checking the cluster status in the ElastiCache dashboard.

By following these steps, you have successfully enabled automatic failover for your AWS ElastiCache Redis cluster, helping to ensure high availability and reliability for your cache system.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Elasticache Automatic Failover not being enabled for AWS ElastiCache using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Automatic Failover for ElastiCache Cluster**:
   
   Run the following AWS CLI command to modify the ElastiCache cluster to enable automatic failover:
   ```
   aws elasticache modify-replication-group --replication-group-id <your-replication-group-id> --automatic-failover-enabled
   ```

   Replace `<your-replication-group-id>` with the ID of your ElastiCache replication group.

2. **Verify Automatic Failover Configuration**:

   To confirm that the automatic failover has been enabled successfully, describe the ElastiCache replication group using the following command:
   ```
   aws elasticache describe-replication-groups --replication-group-id <your-replication-group-id>
   ```

   Ensure that the `AutomaticFailover` parameter is set to `enabled` in the output.

3. **Monitor and Test Failover**:

   It is recommended to monitor the ElastiCache cluster after enabling automatic failover to ensure that it functions as expected. You can simulate a failover scenario to test the automatic failover capability.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of Elasticache Automatic Failover not being enabled for AWS ElastiCache using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Elasticache Automatic Failover not being enabled for AWS Elasticache using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:
   
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Use the following Python script to enable Automatic Failover for your Elasticache cluster:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the Elasticache client
elasticache_client = boto3.client('elasticache')

# Specify the cluster identifier of your Elasticache cluster
cluster_id = 'your-cluster-id'

# Enable Automatic Failover for the specified cluster
response = elasticache_client.modify_replication_group(
    ReplicationGroupId=cluster_id,
    AutomaticFailoverEnabled=True
)

print("Automatic Failover has been enabled for the Elasticache cluster.")
```

3. Replace `'your-cluster-id'` with the actual identifier of your Elasticache cluster.

4. Run the Python script. It will enable Automatic Failover for the specified Elasticache cluster.

By following these steps and running the Python script, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Elasticache Automatic Failover not being enabled for your AWS Elasticache cluster.
