### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon Elasticsearch Service dashboard.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Domains". This will display a list of all Elasticsearch domains that are currently available in your AWS account.

3. Select the Elasticsearch domain that you want to examine, then choose the "Storage" tab from the dashboard bottom panel.

4. In the "EBS Volume Type" field, check the type of SSD used. If it's not set to "General Purpose SSD (gp2)", then the Elasticsearch is not using General Purpose SSD.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by following the instructions provided in the AWS CLI User Guide.

2. List all Elasticsearch domains: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the Elasticsearch domains in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws es list-domain-names
   ```
   This command will return a list of all Elasticsearch domain names.

3. Describe Elasticsearch domain: For each domain name returned in the previous step, use the following AWS CLI command to get detailed information about the domain:

   ```
   aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain --domain-name <your-domain-name>
   ```
   Replace `<your-domain-name>` with the name of your Elasticsearch domain. This command will return a JSON object that contains detailed information about the domain.

4. Check the EBS volume type: In the JSON object returned in the previous step, look for the `EBSOptions` field. This field contains information about the EBS volume associated with the Elasticsearch domain. Check the `VolumeType` field under `EBSOptions`. If the value of `VolumeType` is not `gp2`, then the Elasticsearch domain is not using General Purpose SSD.
   
   Here is an example of what the `EBSOptions` field might look like:

   ```
   "EBSOptions": {
       "EBSEnabled": true,
       "VolumeType": "standard",
       "VolumeSize": 10
   }
   ```
   In this example, the `VolumeType` is `standard`, which means the Elasticsearch domain is not using General Purpose SSD.

#### Using Python

1. Import the necessary libraries: You will need the boto3 library, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. 

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create a session using your AWS credentials. You can configure credentials by using AWS CLI or manually through your script.

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION_NAME'
)
```

3. Now, create an Elasticsearch client using the session.

```python
es_client = session.client('es')
```

4. Now, you can list all the Elasticsearch domains and check their EBS options. If the EBS volume type is not gp2, then it's a misconfiguration.

```python
response = es_client.list_domain_names()
for domain in response['DomainNames']:
    domain_name = domain['DomainName']
    domain_config = es_client.describe_elasticsearch_domain(DomainName=domain_name)
    ebs_options = domain_config['DomainStatus']['EBSOptions']
    if ebs_options['EBSEnabled']:
        if ebs_options['VolumeType'] != 'gp2':
            print(f"Domain {domain_name} is misconfigured. It's using {ebs_options['VolumeType']} instead of General Purpose SSD(gp2).")
```

This script will print all the Elasticsearch domains that are misconfigured.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the Elasticsearch misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AWS console.
2. Navigate to the Elasticsearch service and select the Elasticsearch domain that is misconfigured.
3. Click on the "Modify" button to modify the domain.
4. In the "EBS Options" section, select "General Purpose SSD" as the volume type for your Elasticsearch domain.
5. Click on the "Save Changes" button to save the changes to your Elasticsearch domain.

After completing these steps, your Elasticsearch domain will be using the recommended "General Purpose SSD" volume type. This will help optimize your Elasticsearch performance and ensure that it is running smoothly in your AWS environment.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the Elasticsearch misconfiguration "Elasticsearch should use General Purpose SSD" for AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to get the list of Elasticsearch domains in your AWS account:

   `aws es list-domain-names`

2. Identify the Elasticsearch domain that needs to be remediated.

3. Run the following command to update the Elasticsearch domain configuration to use General Purpose SSD:

   `aws es update-elasticsearch-domain-config --domain-name <domain-name> --ebs-options EBSEnabled=true,VolumeType=gp2`

   Replace `<domain-name>` with the name of the Elasticsearch domain that needs to be remediated.

4. Verify that the Elasticsearch domain configuration has been updated by running the following command:

   `aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain --domain-name <domain-name>`

   Replace `<domain-name>` with the name of the Elasticsearch domain that was remediated.

5. Verify that the Elasticsearch domain is now using General Purpose SSD by checking the value of the `EBSOptions.VolumeType` parameter in the output of the above command. It should be set to `gp2`.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the Elasticsearch misconfiguration "Elasticsearch should use General Purpose SSD" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Elasticsearch should use General Purpose SSD misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using pip install boto3 command.

2. Create an EC2 client using boto3.client('ec2') method.

3. Use the describe_volumes() method of the EC2 client to get the list of all the volumes in your AWS account.

4. Loop through the list of volumes and check if the volume is attached to an Elasticsearch instance.

5. If the volume is attached to an Elasticsearch instance, check the volume type.

6. If the volume type is not "gp2" (General Purpose SSD), modify the volume type to "gp2" using the modify_volume() method of the EC2 client.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 for all the Elasticsearch instances in your AWS account.

Here's the Python code to remediate the Elasticsearch should use General Purpose SSD misconfiguration in AWS:

```
import boto3

# Create an EC2 client
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Get the list of all the volumes in your AWS account
volumes = ec2.describe_volumes()

# Loop through the list of volumes
for volume in volumes['Volumes']:
    # Check if the volume is attached to an Elasticsearch instance
    if 'Tags' in volume:
        for tag in volume['Tags']:
            if tag['Key'] == 'Name' and tag['Value'].startswith('elasticsearch-'):
                # Check the volume type
                if volume['VolumeType'] != 'gp2':
                    # Modify the volume type to "gp2"
                    ec2.modify_volume(VolumeId=volume['VolumeId'], VolumeType='gp2')
``` 

Note: This code assumes that your Elasticsearch instances are named with a prefix "elasticsearch-". You can modify the code based on your naming convention.
