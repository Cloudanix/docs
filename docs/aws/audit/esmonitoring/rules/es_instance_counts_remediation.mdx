How to ensure ElasticSearch instance count does not reach limit quota?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the Amazon Elasticsearch Service console.
3. Navigate to the "Elasticsearch Domains" page.
   (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Elasticsearch Instance Count" Policy.)
4. Review the list of Elasticsearch domains in your account and identify the domains that are approaching or have reached the instance count limit.
5. Determine the desired instance count for each domain based on your workload requirements and organizational policies.
6. If an Elasticsearch domain has reached its instance count limit and needs to be increased, select the domain and click on the "Modify cluster" button.
7. In the "Instance count" section, increase the number of instances to the desired value.
8. Review and adjust other configuration settings as needed, such as the instance type, storage volume type, and networking settings.
9. Click on the "Next" button.
10. Review the summary of the changes you are going to make to the Elasticsearch domain.
11. If everything looks correct, click on the "Submit" button to apply the changes.
12. Wait for the modification to complete. This process may take some time depending on the size of your cluster.
