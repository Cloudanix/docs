How to enable Dedicated Master for ElasticSearch clusters?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon Elasticsearch service.
   (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Elasticsearch Clusters Should Have Dedicated Master Enabled" Policy.)
3. Select the Elasticsearch domain for which you want to enable Dedicated Master nodes.
4. In the domain details page, click on the "Modify cluster" button.
5. In the "Master nodes" section, select the option "Dedicated master nodes".
6. Choose the desired instance type for the dedicated master nodes. You can select an instance type that suits your requirements for performance and availability.
7. Specify the number of dedicated master nodes you want to provision. It is recommended to have at least three dedicated master nodes for high availability.
8. If you want to use a dedicated VPC for your Elasticsearch domain, you can select the VPC from the "VPC options" section. Otherwise, the default VPC will be used.
9. Review the other configuration settings and make any necessary adjustments.
10. Click on the "Next" button.
11. Review the summary of the changes you are going to make to your Elasticsearch domain.
12. If everything looks correct, click on the "Submit" button to apply the changes.
13. Wait for the modification to complete. This process may take some time depending on the size of your cluster.
