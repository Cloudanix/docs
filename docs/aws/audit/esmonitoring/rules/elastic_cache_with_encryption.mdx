### More Info:

Ensure that your AWS ElastiCache Redis clusters are encrypted in order to meet security and compliance requirements (keep Personally Identifiable Information safe). Data encryption helps prevent unauthorized users from reading sensitive data available on your Redis clusters and their associated cache storage systems. This includes data saved to persistent media, known as data at-rest, and data that can be intercepted as it travels through the network, between clients and cache servers, known as data in-transit.

### Risk Level
