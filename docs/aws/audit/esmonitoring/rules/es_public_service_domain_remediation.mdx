### Remediation

How to relaunch and configure your Elasticsearch cluster(s) within an AWS VPC?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Amazon VPC service by selecting "VPC" from the services menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "ElasticSearch Domains Should Be Launched With Private VPC Endpoints" Policy.)
3. In the Amazon VPC dashboard, click on "Subnets" in the left navigation pane.
4. Identify the subnet where your Elasticsearch domain is currently deployed. Note down the subnet ID for reference.
5. In the left navigation pane, click on "Subnet associations" under "Route Tables."
6. Identify the route table associated with the subnet where your Elasticsearch domain is deployed. Note down the route table ID for reference.
7. In the left navigation pane, click on "Route Tables."
8. Search for the route table identified in the previous step using the route table ID.
9. Click on the route table to view its details.
10. In the "Routes" tab, check if there is a route with a destination of "0.0.0.0/0" or any other public route pointing to an internet gateway. This indicates that the subnet is public.
11. To remediate this, you have two options:
    a. Option 1: Create a new private subnet
        - Navigate to the "Subnets" page in the VPC dashboard.
        - Click on "Create subnet" and provide the necessary details.
        - Make sure to select the desired VPC, choose a different availability zone, and specify the CIDR block for the new private subnet.
        - Once the subnet is created, note down its subnet ID for reference.

    b. Option 2: Modify the existing subnet to make it private
        - In the "Subnets" page, select the public subnet where the Elasticsearch domain is deployed.
        - Click on the "Actions" button and choose "Modify subnet attributes."
        - Uncheck the option for "Auto-assign public IPv4 address."
        - Click on "Save" to apply the changes.
12. Once you have a private subnet, associate the new or modified subnet with the appropriate route table:
    - In the "Subnet associations" tab of the route table, click on "Edit subnet associations."
    - Select the private subnet you created or modified in the previous steps.
    - Click on "Save" to associate the subnet with the route table.
13. Now, you need to update the Elasticsearch domain to use the newly created or modified private subnet:
    - Navigate to the Amazon Elasticsearch Service dashboard.
    - Click on the name of the Elasticsearch domain that you want to update.
    - In the domain details page, click on the "Actions" button and select "Modify domain."
    - In the "Network configuration" section, choose the private subnet you created or modified in the previous steps.
    - Click on "Save changes" to update the domain.
14. AWS will start applying the changes to the Elasticsearch domain. This process may take a few minutes to complete.
15. After the changes are successfully applied, the Elasticsearch domain will be running in a private subnet, ensuring that it is not publicly accessible.
