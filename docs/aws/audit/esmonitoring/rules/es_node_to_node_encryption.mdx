title: ElasticSearch Domains Should Have Node To Node Encryption
---

### More Info:

ElasticSearch domain traffic should be encrypted in transit between nodes. ElasticSearch domains should use node-to-node encryption to ensure data in transit remains encrypted using TLS 1.2.

### Risk Level

High

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

HIPAA, GDPR, APRA, MAS, NIST

### Remediation

How to enable node-to-node encryption for your existing Amazon ElasticSearch domains?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Amazon Elasticsearch Service by selecting "Elasticsearch Service" from the services menu.
3. In the Amazon Elasticsearch Service dashboard, click on the name of the Elasticsearch domain that you want to enable node-to-node encryption for.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "ElasticSearch Domains Should Have Node To Node Encryption" Policy.)
4. In the domain details page, click on the "Actions" button and select "Modify domain."
5. Scroll down to the "Node-to-node encryption" section and click on the "Edit" button.
6. In the node-to-node encryption settings, select the "Enable" option to enable node-to-node encryption.
7. Choose the encryption key management service (KMS) key that you want to use for encryption. You can select an existing KMS key or create a new one.
8. If you choose to create a new KMS key, provide the necessary details and follow the instructions to create the key. Otherwise, select an existing KMS key from the dropdown list.
9. Once you have selected the KMS key, click on the "Save changes" button to enable node-to-node encryption for the Elasticsearch domain.
10. AWS will start applying the encryption settings to the domain. This process may take a few minutes to complete.
11. After the node-to-node encryption settings are successfully applied, communication between Elasticsearch nodes within the domain will be encrypted using the specified KMS key.
