How to ensure all active Amazon Elasticsearch (ES) Reserved Instance purchases should be reviewed every 7 days to make sure that no unwanted RI purchase has been placed recently?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify Reserved Instances (RIs): Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs to list all the active Amazon Elasticsearch Reserved Instances in your AWS account.
   (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Elasticsearch Reserved Instance Recent Purchases Should Be Reviewed" Policy.)
2. Review Purchase History: Check the purchase history of the Reserved Instances to determine the purchase date and verify if any unwanted RI purchase has been made recently. You can find the purchase history in the Billing and Cost Management console under the "Reserved Instances" section.
3. Set Up Regular Review Schedule: Establish a regular review schedule to check the active Amazon Elasticsearch Reserved Instances every 7 days. This can be done by creating a recurring reminder in your calendar or setting up a reminder notification through AWS Budgets or a third-party monitoring tool.
4. Validate the Need for RIs: During the review, evaluate the utilization and workload requirements of your Amazon Elasticsearch cluster. Ensure that the existing Reserved Instances align with your current needs and that no unwanted or unnecessary RIs are active.
5. Modify or Release RIs: If you find any unwanted Reserved Instances during the review, take appropriate action. You can modify the attributes of existing RIs, such as changing the instance type or availability zone, to better match your requirements. If the RI is no longer needed, you can release it to free up the capacity.
6. Keep Documentation: Maintain documentation of the review process, including the date of review, findings, and any actions taken. This documentation will help track the review history and provide evidence of compliance.
7. Automate the Review Process (Optional): For larger environments or to streamline the process, consider automating the review process using AWS Config rules or custom scripts. This can help automate the identification of unwanted RIs and ensure regular reviews without manual intervention.
