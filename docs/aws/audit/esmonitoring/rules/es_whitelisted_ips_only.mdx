### Remediation

How to access ES from whitelisted IPs only?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Amazon Elasticsearch Service by selecting "Elasticsearch Service" from the services menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Elasticsearch Domains Should Be Accessible Only From Whitelisted IP Addresses" Policy.)
3. In the Amazon Elasticsearch Service dashboard, select the Elasticsearch domain for which you want to configure access.
4. In the domain details page, click on the "Actions" button and select "Modify access policy."
5. In the access policy editor, update the policy to allow access only from the whitelisted IP addresses. Here's an example of an access policy that allows access from a single IP address:
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Action": "es:*",
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "192.0.2.0/24" 
        }
      },
      "Resource": "arn:aws:es:us-west-2:123456789012:domain/example-domain/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
Replace the `192.0.2.0/24` with the actual IP address or IP range that you want to allow access from. You can also add multiple IP addresses or ranges as needed.
6. Review the modified access policy to ensure that it accurately reflects the desired IP whitelisting configuration.
7. Click on "Submit" to apply the updated access policy to the Elasticsearch domain.
8. AWS will apply the access policy changes to the Elasticsearch domain, which may take a few minutes to complete.
9. Once the changes are successfully applied, the Elasticsearch domain will only allow access from the whitelisted IP addresses specified in the access policy.
