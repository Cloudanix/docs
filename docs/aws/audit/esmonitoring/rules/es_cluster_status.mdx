How to ensure ElasticSearch cluster status is healthy

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon Elasticsearch service.
   (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "ElasticSearch Cluster Status Should Be Healthy" Policy.)
3. Select the Elasticsearch domain for which you want to check the cluster status.
4. In the domain details page, you will find information about the cluster, including the "Cluster health" status.
5. The cluster health status can have one of the following values:
   - Green: Indicates that all primary and replica shards are active.
   - Yellow: Indicates that all primary shards are active, but some replica shards are not available.
   - Red: Indicates that some primary shards are not active, indicating a problem with the cluster.
6. If the cluster health status is "Green," it means that the cluster is healthy. If it is "Yellow" or "Red," there may be issues with the cluster that need attention.
7. Click on the "Indices" tab to see detailed information about the indices in your cluster.
8. Check the status of each index. Ideally, all indices should have a status of "Green."
9. If any indices have a status of "Yellow" or "Red," it indicates that there are issues with the index, such as missing replicas or unassigned shards.
10. To investigate and troubleshoot any issues with the cluster or indices, you can click on the index name to view more details and access relevant logs and metrics.
11. Use the available Elasticsearch management tools and APIs to further diagnose and resolve any issues with the cluster.
