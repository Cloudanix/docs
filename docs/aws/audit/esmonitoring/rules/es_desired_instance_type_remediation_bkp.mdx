### Remediation

How to ensure ElasticSearch instances provisioned in your AWS account have the desired instance type established by your organization based on the workload deployed?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Determine the desired instance types for your Elasticsearch instances based on your workload requirements. Consider factors such as performance, storage capacity, and cost.
2. Identify the existing Elasticsearch domains in your AWS account.
   (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Elasticsearch Should Use The Desired Instance Type" Policy.)
3. For each Elasticsearch domain, follow these steps:
   a. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   b. Navigate to the Amazon Elasticsearch service.
   c. Select the Elasticsearch domain you want to modify.   
   d. In the domain details page, click on the "Modify cluster" button.   
   e. In the "Instance types" section, select the desired instance type(s) for your Elasticsearch nodes. You can specify different instance types for the data nodes, master nodes, and search nodes, depending on your configuration.   
   f. Review and adjust other configuration settings as needed, such as the number of instances, storage options, and networking settings.   
   g. Click on the "Next" button.   
   h. Review the summary of the changes you are going to make to your Elasticsearch domain.   
   i. If everything looks correct, click on the "Submit" button to apply the changes.   
   j. Wait for the modification to complete. This process may take some time depending on the size of your cluster.
