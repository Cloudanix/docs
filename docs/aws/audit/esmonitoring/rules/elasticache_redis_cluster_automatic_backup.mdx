### More Info:

This rule checks if the Amazon ElastiCache Redis clusters have automatic backup turned on. The rule is NON_COMPLIANT if the SnapshotRetentionLimit for Redis cluster is less than the SnapshotRetentionPeriod parameter. For example: If the parameter is 15 then the rule is non-compliant if the snapshotRetentionPeriod is between 0-15.

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the ElastiCache dashboard by selecting "ElastiCache" under the "Database" category.
3. In the ElastiCache dashboard, you will see a list of all your ElastiCache clusters. Click on the name of the cluster you want to check.
4. In the cluster details page, look for the "Backup" section. Here, you can see the backup settings for the cluster. If the "Automatic Backup" is not enabled, it means the cluster is misconfigured.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by downloading the appropriate installer from the AWS website. Once installed, you can configure it by running `aws configure` and providing your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all ElastiCache clusters: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all your ElastiCache clusters:

   ```
   aws elasticache describe-cache-clusters --region your-region-name
   ```
   Replace 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region. This command will return a JSON output with details of all your ElastiCache clusters.

3. Extract the backup retention period: For each cluster, you can extract the 'SnapshotRetentionLimit' field which indicates the number of days for which ElastiCache will retain automatic snapshots. You can do this using a tool like 'jq' or a scripting language like Python.

   ```
   aws elasticache describe-cache-clusters --region your-region-name | jq '.CacheClusters[].SnapshotRetentionLimit'
   ```
   
4. Check the backup retention period: If the 'SnapshotRetentionLimit' is 0, it means that automatic backup is not enabled for that cluster. If it's greater than 0, it means that automatic backup is enabled and the value indicates the number of days for which backups are retained. You can use this information to identify any clusters that do not have automatic backup enabled.

#### Using Python

To check if ElastiCache clusters have automatic backup enabled using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the Boto3 library in Python:**
   Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:
   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create an AWS session using your credentials:**
   You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI. Here is an example:
   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ```

3. **Get the list of all ElastiCache clusters and their details:**
   Use the `describe_cache_clusters` method to get the details of all ElastiCache clusters.
   ```python
   client = session.client('elasticache')
   response = client.describe_cache_clusters()
   ```

4. **Check if automatic backup is enabled for each cluster:**
   The `SnapshotRetentionLimit` parameter in the response indicates the number of days for which ElastiCache retains automatic snapshots. If the value of `SnapshotRetentionLimit` is 0, automatic backup is not enabled for that cluster.
   ```python
   for cluster in response['CacheClusters']:
       if cluster['SnapshotRetentionLimit'] == 0:
           print(f"Automatic backup is not enabled for the cluster: {cluster['CacheClusterId']}")
   ```
This script will print the IDs of all ElastiCache clusters for which automatic backup is not enabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration for AWS ElastiCache clusters not having automatic backups enabled, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to ElastiCache Dashboard**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top, and then select "ElastiCache" under the "Database" category.

3. **Select the ElastiCache Cluster**: In the ElastiCache dashboard, select the ElastiCache cluster for which you want to enable automatic backups by clicking on the cluster ID.

4. **Modify Cluster Settings**: In the cluster details page, click on the "Modify" button at the top right corner.

5. **Enable Automatic Backups**: Scroll down to the "Backup" section in the Modify Cluster page. Check the box next to "Automatic backups" to enable automatic backups for the ElastiCache cluster.

6. **Configure Backup Retention Period**: Set the desired backup retention period. You can choose the number of days for which you want to retain the automatic backups.

7. **Save Changes**: Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Modify" button to save the changes.

8. **Monitor Backup Status**: Once the modifications are saved, monitor the status of the automatic backups in the ElastiCache dashboard to ensure that they are running as expected.

By following these steps, you have successfully enabled automatic backups for your AWS ElastiCache cluster, thereby remediating the misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Elasticache clusters not having automatic backups enabled for AWS Elasticache using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Enable automatic backups for the Elasticache cluster**:
   
   Run the following AWS CLI command to modify the Elasticache cluster's backup retention period and enable automatic backups:
   ```
   aws elasticache modify-cache-cluster --cache-cluster-id your-cluster-id --automatic-failover-enabled true --snapshot-retention-limit 7
   ```
   Replace `your-cluster-id` with the actual ID of the Elasticache cluster.

2. **Verify the configuration**:
   
   You can verify that automatic backups are enabled for the Elasticache cluster by describing the cluster using the following command:
   ```
   aws elasticache describe-cache-clusters --cache-cluster-id your-cluster-id
   ```
   Ensure that the `AutomaticFailoverEnabled` parameter is set to `true` and the `SnapshotRetentionLimit` is set to the desired value (in days).

3. **Monitor the backups**:
   
   After enabling automatic backups, monitor the backups to ensure they are being created as expected. You can do this by checking the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS CLI to list the backups:
   ```
   aws elasticache describe-snapshots --cache-cluster-id your-cluster-id
   ```
   This command will list all the snapshots associated with the Elasticache cluster.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Elasticache clusters not having automatic backups enabled for AWS Elasticache using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To enable automatic backups for an Amazon Elasticache cluster using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with the AWS API. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this misconfiguration:

1. Install Boto3:
   Make sure you have Boto3 installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials:
   Ensure that you have your AWS credentials set up with the necessary permissions to modify Elasticache clusters. You can set up your credentials using the AWS CLI or by setting environment variables.

3. Write Python script:
   Create a Python script with the following code to enable automatic backups for an Elasticache cluster:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize the Elasticache client
   elasticache_client = boto3.client('elasticache')

   # Specify the name of the Elasticache cluster to enable automatic backups
   cluster_name = 'your-cluster-name'

   # Enable automatic backups for the specified Elasticache cluster
   response = elasticache_client.modify_cache_cluster(
       CacheClusterId=cluster_name,
       AutomaticBackupRetentionDays=1,  # Set the retention period for automatic backups
       PreferredBackupWindow='07:00-09:00',  # Set the preferred backup window
       ApplyImmediately=True
   )

   print(f"Automatic backups enabled for Elasticache cluster: {cluster_name}")
   ```

4. Run the Python script:
   Save the Python script and run it. This script will enable automatic backups for the specified Elasticache cluster.

5. Verify:
   After running the script, you can verify in the AWS Management Console that automatic backups have been enabled for the Elasticache cluster.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not having automatic backups enabled for an AWS Elasticache cluster using Python and Boto3.
