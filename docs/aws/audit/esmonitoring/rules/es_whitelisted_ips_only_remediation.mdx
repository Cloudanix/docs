### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the Elasticsearch Domains Should Be Accessible Only From Whitelisted IP Addresses misconfiguration in AWS, follow these steps:

1. Login to your AWS console and navigate to the Elasticsearch service.

2. Select the Elasticsearch domain that you want to remediate.

3. Click on the "Modify access policy" button.

4. In the "Access policy" section, select the "Custom access policy" option.

5. Replace the existing policy with the following policy:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "es:*",
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": [
            "x.x.x.x/32",
            "y.y.y.y/32"
          ]
        }
      },
      "Resource": "arn:aws:es:us-west-2:123456789012:domain/my-domain/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

6. Replace the `x.x.x.x/32` and `y.y.y.y/32` with the IP addresses that you want to whitelist.

7. Click on the "Save changes" button to save the new access policy.

This will ensure that only the whitelisted IP addresses will be able to access the Elasticsearch domain.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Elasticsearch domains being accessible only from whitelisted IP addresses in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to get the Elasticsearch domain endpoint:

```
aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain --domain-name <your-domain-name> --output text --query 'DomainStatus.Endpoint'
```

3. Run the following command to get the current access policy of the Elasticsearch domain:

```
aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain --domain-name <your-domain-name> --output text --query 'DomainStatus.AccessPolicies'
```

4. Copy the output of the above command to a text editor and edit the access policy to allow access only from the whitelisted IP addresses.

5. Run the following command to update the access policy of the Elasticsearch domain:

```
aws es update-elasticsearch-domain-config --domain-name <your-domain-name> --access-policies <path-to-edited-access-policy-file>
```

Replace `<path-to-edited-access-policy-file>` with the path to the file containing the edited access policy.

6. Verify that the access policy has been updated by running the following command:

```
aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain --domain-name <your-domain-name> --output text --query 'DomainStatus.AccessPolicies'
```

The output should show the updated access policy.

7. Test the Elasticsearch domain to ensure that it is accessible only from the whitelisted IP addresses.

#### Using Python

To remediate this misconfiguration for AWS Elasticsearch domains, you can use the AWS Python SDK, Boto3. Here are the steps to remediate:

1. Install Boto3: You can install Boto3 using pip. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Create a Boto3 client for Elasticsearch: In your Python script, create a Boto3 client for Elasticsearch using the following code:

   ```python
   import boto3

   es_client = boto3.client('es')
   ```

3. Get the Elasticsearch domain configuration: Use the `describe_elasticsearch_domain_config` method of the Elasticsearch client to get the current domain configuration. Here is an example code:

   ```python
   domain_name = 'your-domain-name'

   response = es_client.describe_elasticsearch_domain_config(
       DomainName=domain_name
   )

   domain_config = response['DomainConfig']
   ```

4. Update the Elasticsearch domain access policy: Update the access policy of the Elasticsearch domain to allow access only from whitelisted IP addresses. You can use the `update_elasticsearch_domain_config` method of the Elasticsearch client to update the access policy. Here is an example code:

   ```python
   # Whitelist IP addresses
   ip_addresses = ['1.2.3.4', '5.6.7.8']

   # Create the access policy
   access_policy = {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "AWS": "*"
               },
               "Action": "es:*",
               "Condition": {
                   "IpAddress": {
                       "aws:SourceIp": ip_addresses
                   }
               },
               "Resource": "arn:aws:es:us-east-1:123456789012:domain/your-domain-name/*"
           }
       ]
   }

   # Update the Elasticsearch domain configuration
   es_client.update_elasticsearch_domain_config(
       DomainName=domain_name,
       ElasticsearchClusterConfig=domain_config['ElasticsearchClusterConfig'],
       EBSOptions=domain_config['EBSOptions'],
       SnapshotOptions=domain_config['SnapshotOptions'],
       AdvancedOptions=domain_config['AdvancedOptions'],
       AccessPolicies=json.dumps(access_policy)
   )
   ```

   In the above code, replace `ip_addresses` with a list of the IP addresses that should be whitelisted.

5. Verify the Elasticsearch domain configuration: Use the `describe_elasticsearch_domain_config` method of the Elasticsearch client to verify that the access policy has been updated. Here is an example code:

   ```python
   response = es_client.describe_elasticsearch_domain_config(
       DomainName=domain_name
   )

   access_policies = json.loads(response['DomainConfig']['AccessPolicies'])

   print(access_policies)
   ```

   The above code will print the updated access policy. Verify that the IP addresses in the access policy match the whitelisted IP addresses.

That's it! The Elasticsearch domain is now accessible only from the whitelisted IP addresses.
