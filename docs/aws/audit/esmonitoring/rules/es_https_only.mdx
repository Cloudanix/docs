### Remediation

How to ensure Elastic Search uses HTTPS only?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon Elasticsearch service.
3. Select the Elasticsearch domain for which you want to enable HTTPS.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "ElasticSearch Should Use HTTPS Only" Policy.)
4. In the domain details page, click on the "Configure" button in the "Node-to-Node Encryption" section.
5. Enable the "Enable encryption of data at rest" option to encrypt the data stored in Elasticsearch.
6. Under the "Advanced security options" section, select "Request Signing Only" for the "Fine-grained access control" option. This ensures that requests to Elasticsearch must be signed and authenticated.
7. In the "Encryption in transit" section, select the "Require HTTPS for all traffic" option.
8. Choose the appropriate certificate option. You can either use a custom certificate from ACM or upload your own certificate.
9. If you choose to use a custom certificate from ACM, select the appropriate certificate from the dropdown list.
10. If you choose to upload your own certificate, select the "Upload" option and provide the certificate and private key files.
11. Click on the "Save changes" button to apply the configuration.
12. After saving the changes, Elasticsearch will be accessible only through HTTPS, and all requests to Elasticsearch must be signed and authenticated.
