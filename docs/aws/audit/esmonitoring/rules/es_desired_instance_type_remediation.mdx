1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) dashboard.
3. In the navigation pane, choose "Domains".
4. Select the name of the Elasticsearch domain that you want to examine. In the "Overview" section, check the "Instance type" field. If the instance type is not the desired one, then the Elasticsearch is not using the desired instance type.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Elasticsearch service.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the `describe-elasticsearch-domain` command to get the configuration details of your Elasticsearch domain. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain --domain-name your_domain_name
   ```

   Replace `your_domain_name` with the name of your Elasticsearch domain.

3. The output of the above command will be in JSON format. You can find the instance type under the `ElasticsearchClusterConfig` field. The instance type will be listed under the `InstanceType` field.

4. To check if Elasticsearch is using the desired instance type, you can compare the value of the `InstanceType` field with your desired instance type. If they are not the same, then there is a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Import the necessary libraries: You will need the boto3 library, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc.

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create a session using your AWS credentials. You can configure credentials in the AWS credentials profile file on your local system. 

```python
session = boto3.Session(profile_name='my_profile')
es_client = session.client('es')
```

3. Now, you can list all the Elasticsearch domains and check their instance types. Here, we are checking if the instance type is 'm4.large.elasticsearch', you can replace it with your desired instance type.

```python
def check_es_instance_type():
    domains = es_client.list_domain_names()
    for domain in domains['DomainNames']:
        domain_name = domain['DomainName']
        domain_config = es_client.describe_elasticsearch_domain(DomainName=domain_name)
        instance_type = domain_config['DomainStatus']['ElasticsearchClusterConfig']['InstanceType']
        if instance_type != 'm4.large.elasticsearch':
            print(f"Domain {domain_name} is not using the desired instance type. Current instance type: {instance_type}")
```

4. Call the function to start the check.

```python
check_es_instance_type()
```

This script will print out the domains that are not using the desired instance type. You can modify the script according to your needs, for example, you can add an else statement to print out the domains that are using the desired instance type.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the Elasticsearch misconfiguration "Elasticsearch Should Use The Desired Instance Type" for AWS using the AWS console:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Elasticsearch Service.
2. Click on the Elasticsearch domain that you want to remediate.
3. In the navigation pane, click on the "Elasticsearch Version" link.
4. In the "Elasticsearch Version" page, click on the "Update" button.
5. In the "Update Elasticsearch Version" page, select the desired Elasticsearch version and instance type.
6. Click on the "Next" button.
7. In the "Instance Configuration" page, select the number of instances and the instance type.
8. Click on the "Next" button.
9. In the "Review" page, review the changes and click on the "Submit" button to apply the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, the Elasticsearch instance will be updated to use the desired instance type.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the Elasticsearch instance type misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI and check the current Elasticsearch instance type by running the following command:

   ```
   aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain --domain-name <your-domain-name> --output json
   ```

2. The output will show the current Elasticsearch instance type. Note down the instance type and determine the desired instance type.

3. Modify the Elasticsearch instance type by running the following command:

   ```
   aws es update-elasticsearch-domain-config --domain-name <your-domain-name> --elasticsearch-cluster-config InstanceType=<desired-instance-type>
   ```

   Replace `<your-domain-name>` with the name of your Elasticsearch domain and `<desired-instance-type>` with the desired instance type.

4. Wait for the Elasticsearch domain to update, which may take several minutes. You can check the status of the update by running the following command:

   ```
   aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain --domain-name <your-domain-name> --output json
   ```

5. Verify that the Elasticsearch instance type has been updated to the desired instance type.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the Elasticsearch instance type misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the Elasticsearch misconfiguration "Elasticsearch Should Use The Desired Instance Type" in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the desired instance type for Elasticsearch in your AWS account.

2. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update the Elasticsearch domain's instance type to the desired instance type.

Here is an example code snippet that you can use to update the Elasticsearch domain's instance type to the desired instance type:

```python
import boto3

# Define the desired Elasticsearch instance type
desired_instance_type = 'm5.large.elasticsearch'

# Connect to the Elasticsearch service using Boto3
es_client = boto3.client('es')

# Get the list of Elasticsearch domains in your AWS account
es_domains = es_client.list_domain_names()['DomainNames']

# Loop through each Elasticsearch domain and update its instance type to the desired instance type
for es_domain in es_domains:
    es_domain_name = es_domain['DomainName']
    es_domain_status = es_client.describe_elasticsearch_domain(DomainName=es_domain_name)['DomainStatus']
    current_instance_type = es_domain_status['ElasticsearchClusterConfig']['InstanceType']
    if current_instance_type != desired_instance_type:
        es_client.update_elasticsearch_domain_config(
            DomainName=es_domain_name,
            ElasticsearchClusterConfig={
                'InstanceType': desired_instance_type
            }
        )
        print(f"Updated Elasticsearch domain '{es_domain_name}' instance type from '{current_instance_type}' to '{desired_instance_type}'.")
    else:
        print(f"Elasticsearch domain '{es_domain_name}' instance type is already set to '{desired_instance_type}'.")
```

This code will loop through each Elasticsearch domain in your AWS account, check its current instance type, and update it to the desired instance type if it is not already set to that value. Note that you will need to have the appropriate AWS credentials configured to run this code.
