How to block anonymous access to your Amazon ElasticSearch domains?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Amazon Elasticsearch Service by selecting "Elasticsearch Service" from the services menu.
3. In the Amazon Elasticsearch Service dashboard, select the Elasticsearch domain for which you want to block anonymous access.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Elasticsearch Domains Should Not Be Publicly Exposed" Policy.)
4. In the domain details page, click on the "Modify access policy" button.
5. In the access policy editor, update the policy to deny anonymous access. Here's an example of an access policy that blocks anonymous access:
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "es:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:es:us-west-2:123456789012:domain/example-domain/*",
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
This access policy denies access to anyone (anonymous users) who tries to access the Elasticsearch domain over an insecure (non-HTTPS) connection. You can replace `us-west-2` and `123456789012` with the appropriate region and your AWS account ID, respectively. 
6. Review the modified access policy to ensure that it accurately reflects the desired configuration to block anonymous access.
7. Click on "Submit" to apply the updated access policy to the Elasticsearch domain.
8. AWS will apply the access policy changes to the Elasticsearch domain, which may take a few minutes to complete.
9. Once the changes are successfully applied, anonymous users attempting to access the Elasticsearch domain will be denied access.
