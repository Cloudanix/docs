3. Provide Account Information: Share your AWS account information with AWS Support, including the account ID and the region where your ElasticSearch instances are located. This will help them locate and identify the specific instances affected by the payment failure.
4. Work with AWS Support: Collaborate with the AWS Support team to resolve the payment issue. They will guide you through the necessary steps to remediate the failure, such as updating payment details, retrying the payment, or resolving any underlying billing issues.
5. Monitor Payment Status: After working with AWS Support to address the payment failure, monitor the payment status to ensure that it is successfully resolved. Check the AWS Management Console or your account billing information for updates on the payment status.
