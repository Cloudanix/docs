### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Elasticsearch service.
2. In the Elasticsearch dashboard, select the "Reserved Instances" option from the left-hand side menu.
3. In the Reserved Instances page, you will see a list of all your reserved instances. Look for the "Expiration Date" column in the list.
4. Check the dates in the "Expiration Date" column. If any of the dates are within the next 30 days, then those Elasticsearch Reserved Instances are set to expire soon.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by downloading the appropriate installer from the AWS CLI website. Once installed, you can configure it by running `aws configure` and providing your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all Elasticsearch Reserved Instances: Use the `es:describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instances` command to list all the reserved instances. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws es describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instances
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with details about all your Elasticsearch reserved instances.

3. Parse the output: You need to parse the output to find the instances that will expire in the next 30 days. You can do this using a tool like `jq`. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws es describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instances | jq -r '.ReservedElasticsearchInstances[] | select(.Duration == 31536000) | select(.State == "active") | .ReservedElasticsearchInstanceId'
   ```

   This command will return the IDs of the instances that will expire in the next 30 days.

4. Check the expiration date: For each instance ID returned by the previous command, you can check the exact expiration date using the `es:describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instance-offerings` command. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws es describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instance-offerings --reserved-elasticsearch-instance-offering-id <instance-id>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance you want to check. This command will return a JSON output with details about the instance, including the expiration date.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the boto3 library. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: Before you can interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a credentials file at ~/.aws/credentials. At a minimum, the credentials file should specify the access key and secret access key. To specify these for the default profile, you can use the following format:

   ```python
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check Elasticsearch Reserved Instance Lease Expiration:

   ```python
   import boto3
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Create a client
   client = boto3.client('es')

   # Get the current date
   current_date = datetime.now()

   # Get all reserved Elasticsearch instances
   response = client.describe_reserved_elasticsearch_instances()

   # Iterate over each reserved instance
   for reserved_instance in response['ReservedElasticsearchInstances']:
       # Get the end date of the lease
       end_date = reserved_instance['ReservedElasticsearchInstanceEndTime']

       # Calculate the difference between the current date and the end date
       difference = end_date - current_date

       # If the difference is less than or equal to 30 days, print a warning
       if difference <= timedelta(days=30):
           print(f"Warning: The lease for the reserved Elasticsearch instance {reserved_instance['ReservedElasticsearchInstanceId']} will expire in the next 30 days.")
   ```

4. Run the Python script: You can run the Python script from the command line using the Python interpreter:

   ```python
   python check_es_lease_expiration.py
   ```
   
This script will print a warning for each reserved Elasticsearch instance whose lease will expire in the next 30 days.

1. Login to your AWS console.
2. Go to the Elasticsearch service.
3. Click on the "Reserved Instances" option in the left-hand menu.
4. Identify the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance that is expiring in the next 30 days.
5. Click on the "Modify Reserved Instance" button.
6. Select the "Extend the term of this Reserved Instance" option.
7. Choose the desired term length for the extension.
8. Review the changes and click on the "Purchase" button to complete the reservation extension.

By following these steps, you will have successfully remediated the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance Lease Expiration in the next 30 days issue on AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance Lease Expiration issue in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.
2. Run the following command to list all the Elasticsearch Reserved Instances in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws es describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instances
   ```

3. Identify the Reserved Instance that has an expiration date within the next 30 days.
4. Run the following command to modify the Reserved Instance:

   ```
   aws es modify-reserved-elasticsearch-instance --reserved-elasticsearch-instance-id <Reserved Instance ID> --reserved-elasticsearch-instance-offering-id <New Offering ID>
   ```

   Replace `<Reserved Instance ID>` with the ID of the Reserved Instance that needs to be modified, and `<New Offering ID>` with the ID of the new Elasticsearch Reserved Instance offering that you want to use.

   Note: You can use the `aws es describe-elasticsearch-instance-type-offerings` command to list all the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance offerings available in your account.

5. Verify that the Reserved Instance has been modified by running the following command:

   ```
   aws es describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instances --reserved-elasticsearch-instance-id <Reserved Instance ID>
   ```

   Replace `<Reserved Instance ID>` with the ID of the Reserved Instance that you modified.

6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all the Elasticsearch Reserved Instances that have an expiration date within the next 30 days.

By following these steps, you can remediate the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance Lease Expiration issue in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance Lease Expiration in the next 30 days issue on AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK modules in Python:

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

2. Set up the AWS credentials and region:

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Create an Elasticsearch client:

```python
es_client = session.client('es')
```

4. Retrieve the list of Elasticsearch domains:

```python
domains = es_client.list_domain_names()['DomainNames']
```

5. Loop through each domain and check if there are any reserved instances expiring in the next 30 days:

```python
for domain in domains:
    domain_name = domain['DomainName']
    reserved_instances = es_client.list_reserved_elasticsearch_instances(
        ElasticsearchInstanceType='m4.large.elasticsearch',
        MaxResults=100,
        NextToken=''
    )['ReservedElasticsearchInstances']
    for ri in reserved_instances:
        expiration_date = ri['StartTime'] + timedelta(days=ri['Duration'])
        if expiration_date <= datetime.now() + timedelta(days=30):
            print(f"Reserved instance for {domain_name} is expiring on {expiration_date}.")
```

6. To remediate the issue, you can either renew the reserved instance or purchase a new one. To renew the reserved instance, use the following code:

```python
es_client.purchase_reserved_elasticsearch_instance_offering(
    ReservedElasticsearchInstanceOfferingId='OFFERING_ID',
    ReservationName='RESERVATION_NAME',
    InstanceCount=1
)
```

Replace `OFFERING_ID` with the ID of the reserved instance offering, and `RESERVATION_NAME` with a name for the reservation.

7. If you want to purchase a new reserved instance, use the following code:

```python
es_client.purchase_reserved_elasticsearch_instance_offering(
    ReservedElasticsearchInstanceOfferingId='OFFERING_ID',
    InstanceCount=1,
    ReservationName='RESERVATION_NAME'
)
```

Replace `OFFERING_ID` with the ID of the reserved instance offering, and `RESERVATION_NAME` with a name for the reservation.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the Elasticsearch Reserved Instance Lease Expiration in the next 30 days issue on AWS using Python.
