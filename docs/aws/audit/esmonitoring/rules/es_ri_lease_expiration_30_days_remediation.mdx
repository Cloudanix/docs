<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent Elasticsearch Reserved Instance Lease Expiration in the next 30 days using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check Current Reserved Instances:**
   First, you need to list your current reserved instances to identify which ones are nearing expiration.
   ```sh
   aws es describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instances
   ```

2. **Monitor Expiration Dates:**
   Extract and monitor the expiration dates of your reserved instances. You can use a script to automate this process and alert you when an instance is nearing expiration.
   ```sh
   aws es describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instances --query 'ReservedElasticsearchInstances[*].{ID:ReservedElasticsearchInstanceId, Expiration:EndTime}'
   ```

3. **Purchase New Reserved Instances:**
   If you identify that a reserved instance is expiring soon, you can purchase a new reserved instance to replace it.
   ```sh
   aws es purchase-reserved-elasticsearch-instance-offering --reserved-elasticsearch-instance-offering-id <OfferingID> --reservation-name <Name> --instance-count <Count>
   ```

4. **Automate Renewal Process:**
   To ensure continuous coverage, you can automate the renewal process using a script that runs periodically (e.g., via a cron job) to check for expiring instances and purchase new ones as needed.

By following these steps, you can prevent Elasticsearch Reserved Instance Lease Expiration and ensure continuous availability and cost efficiency of your Elasticsearch clusters.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent Elasticsearch Reserved Instance Lease Expiration in the next 30 days using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   - Install Boto3 if you haven't already:
     ```bash
     pip install boto3
     ```

2. **Create a Python Script to Monitor Reserved Instances:**
   - Use Boto3 to connect to AWS and check the expiration dates of your Elasticsearch Reserved Instances.
   - Here is a sample script to get you started:

     ```python
     import boto3
     from datetime import datetime, timedelta

     # Initialize a session using Amazon Elasticsearch
     client = boto3.client('es')

     # Get the current date and the date 30 days from now
     current_date = datetime.now()
     expiration_threshold = current_date + timedelta(days=30)

     # Describe reserved instances
     response = client.describe_reserved_elasticsearch_instances()

     # Check for instances expiring in the next 30 days
     for reserved_instance in response['ReservedElasticsearchInstances']:
         expiration_date = reserved_instance['EndTime']
         if expiration_date <= expiration_threshold:
             print(f"Reserved Instance {reserved_instance['ReservedElasticsearchInstanceId']} is expiring on {expiration_date}")

     # Optionally, you can add logic to send notifications or take other actions
     ```

3. **Automate the Script Execution:**
   - Schedule the script to run periodically (e.g., daily) using a cron job or AWS Lambda to ensure continuous monitoring.
   - Example of a cron job entry to run the script daily at midnight:
     ```bash
     0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py
     ```

4. **Set Up Notifications:**
   - Integrate with AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) to send alerts when a reserved instance is about to expire.
   - Modify the script to publish a message to an SNS topic:

     ```python
     import boto3
     from datetime import datetime, timedelta

     # Initialize a session using Amazon Elasticsearch and SNS
     es_client = boto3.client('es')
     sns_client = boto3.client('sns')

     # SNS Topic ARN
     sns_topic_arn = 'arn:aws:sns:your-region:your-account-id:your-topic'

     # Get the current date and the date 30 days from now
     current_date = datetime.now()
     expiration_threshold = current_date + timedelta(days=30)

     # Describe reserved instances
     response = es_client.describe_reserved_elasticsearch_instances()

     # Check for instances expiring in the next 30 days
     for reserved_instance in response['ReservedElasticsearchInstances']:
         expiration_date = reserved_instance['EndTime']
         if expiration_date <= expiration_threshold:
             message = f"Reserved Instance {reserved_instance['ReservedElasticsearchInstanceId']} is expiring on {expiration_date}"
             print(message)
             sns_client.publish(
                 TopicArn=sns_topic_arn,
                 Message=message,
                 Subject='Elasticsearch Reserved Instance Expiration Alert'
             )
     ```

By following these steps, you can effectively monitor and prevent Elasticsearch Reserved Instance Lease Expiration using Python scripts.

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Elasticsearch service.
2. In the Elasticsearch dashboard, select "Reserved Instances" from the left-hand side menu.
3. In the Reserved Instances page, you will see a list of all your reserved instances. Look for the "Expiration Date" column in the table.
4. Check the dates in the "Expiration Date" column. If any of the dates are within the next 30 days, then those Elasticsearch Reserved Instances are set to expire soon.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all Elasticsearch Reserved Instances: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all your Elasticsearch Reserved Instances:

   ```
   aws es describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instances
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with details about all your Elasticsearch Reserved Instances.

3. Parse the output: You need to parse the output to get the details of the Reserved Instances that are about to expire in the next 30 days. You can do this using a tool like `jq`. Here is an example command:

   ```
   aws es describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instances | jq -r '.ReservedElasticsearchInstances[] | select(.State=="active" and .DurationRemainingInSeconds < 2592000) | .ReservedElasticsearchInstanceId'
   ```

   This command will return the IDs of the Reserved Instances that are about to expire in the next 30 days.

4. Check the details of the expiring Reserved Instances: You can then use the IDs returned by the previous command to check the details of the expiring Reserved Instances. Here is an example command:

   ```
   aws es describe-reserved-elasticsearch-instances --reserved-elasticsearch-instance-id <instance-id>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the Reserved Instance you want to check. This command will return a JSON output with the details of the specified Reserved Instance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with AWS services, you need to install the boto3 library. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials: Before you can interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a credentials file at ~/.aws/credentials. At a minimum, the credentials file should specify the access key and secret access key. To specify these for the default profile, you can use the following format:

   ```python
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check Elasticsearch Reserved Instance Lease Expiration: 

   ```python
   import boto3
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Create a client
   client = boto3.client('es')

   # Get the current date
   current_date = datetime.now()

   # Get the list of all reserved Elasticsearch instances
   response = client.describe_reserved_elasticsearch_instances()

   # Iterate over each reserved instance
   for reserved_instance in response['ReservedElasticsearchInstances']:
       # Get the end date of the reserved instance
       end_date = reserved_instance['ReservedElasticsearchInstanceEnd']

       # Calculate the difference between the current date and the end date
       difference = end_date - current_date

       # If the difference is less than or equal to 30 days, print a message
       if difference.days <= 30:
           print(f"The reserved instance {reserved_instance['ReservedElasticsearchInstanceId']} will expire in the next 30 days.")
   ```

4. Run the Python script: You can run the Python script using any Python interpreter. If the script is saved as a file named check_es_reserved_instances.py, you can run it using the following command:

   ```python
   python check_es_reserved_instances.py
   ```
   
This script will print a message for each Elasticsearch reserved instance that will expire in the next 30 days.
