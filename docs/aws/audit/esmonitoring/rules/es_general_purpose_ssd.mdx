How to ensure ElasticSearch uses General Purpose SSD?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the Elasticsearch domains for which you want to enable General Purpose SSD storage.
2. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
3. Navigate to the Amazon Elasticsearch service.
4. Select the Elasticsearch domain you want to modify.
   (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Elasticsearch Should Use General Purpose SSD" Policy.)
5. In the domain details page, click on the "Modify cluster" button.
6. In the "EBS options" section, select "General Purpose SSD (gp2)" as the storage volume type.
7. Set the desired volume size for your Elasticsearch domain. Consider your storage requirements and adjust the size accordingly.
8. Review and adjust other configuration settings as needed, such as the instance types, number of instances, and networking settings.
9. Click on the "Next" button.
10. Review the summary of the changes you are going to make to your Elasticsearch domain.
11. If everything looks correct, click on the "Submit" button to apply the changes.
12. Wait for the modification to complete. This process may take some time depending on the size of your cluster.
