How to identify overutilized RDS DB instances and upgrade them?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the navigation panel, under the RDS Dashboard section, choose Databases.

- Step 2: Select the overused RDS database instance that you want to resize (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource).

- Step 3: Click the Instance Actions button from the dashboard top menu and select Modify.

- Step 4: On the Modify DB Instance: instance identifier page, under Instance Specifications section, select the database instance type to upgrade to (e.g. db.m4.xlarge) from the DB Instance Class dropdown list (see RDS Instance Types page available at this URL to help you choose the right database instance type).

- Step 5: At the bottom, check Apply Immediately to apply the instance type (class) change immediately.

- Step 6: Click Continue to access the DB instance review page.

- Step 7: Review the type/class changes then click Modify DB Instance. During the resize process the instance status should change from available to modifying and back to available (it may take few minutes depending on the database instance configuration). Once the resize process is complete, the RDS instance type should be updated on the details panel.
