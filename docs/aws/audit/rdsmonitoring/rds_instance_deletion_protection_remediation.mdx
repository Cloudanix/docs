How to enable RDS Instance Deletion Protection?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: On the left Menu, under Amazon RDS, click Instances and Select the RDS database instance that you want to reconfigure (see Audit section part I to identify the right RDS resource).

- Step 2: Click the Instance Actions button from the dashboard top menu and select Modify.

- Step 3: On the Modify DB Instance: instance-identifier page, in the Deletion protection section, select Enable deletion protection checkbox to activate Deletion Protection safety feature and click continue to continue the reconfiguration process.

- Step 4: Within Summary of modifications section, carefully review the configuration changes that you want to apply to the instance.

- Step 5: In the Scheduling of modifications section, perform one of the following actions based on your requirements:
  A: Select Apply during the next scheduled maintenance window to apply the changes automatically during the next scheduled maintenance window.
  B: Select Apply immediately to apply the changes right away. With this option any pending modifications will be asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless of the maintenance window setting for this RDS database instance. Note that any changes available in the pending modifications queue are also applied. If any of the pending modifications require downtime, choosing this option can cause unexpected downtime for your application.

- Step 6: Click Modify DB Instance to save your configuration changes.
