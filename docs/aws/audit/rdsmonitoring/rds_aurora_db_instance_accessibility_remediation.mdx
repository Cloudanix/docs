### Remediation

How to ensure that all the database instances within an Amazon Aurora database cluster have the same accessibility?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the navigation panel, under Amazon RDS, choose Databases.

- Step 2: Select the Amazon RDS database instance that you want to reconfigure, and choose Modify.

- Step 3: On the Modify DB instance: instance-name configuration page, perform the following:
  A: In the Connectivity section, choose Additional configuration, and select Publicly accessible to make the selected database instance publicly accessible.
  B: Choose Continue and review the configuration changes that you want to apply, available in the Summary of modifications section.
  C: In the Scheduling of modifications section, perform one of the following actions based on your workload requirements:
  1: Select Apply during the next scheduled maintenance window to apply the changes automatically during the next scheduled maintenance window.
  2: Select Apply immediately to apply the changes right away. With this option, any pending modifications will be asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless of the maintenance window configured for the selected database instance. Note that any changes available in the pending modifications queue are also applied. If any of the pending modifications require downtime, choosing this option can cause unexpected downtime for your database application.
  D: Choose Modify DB instance to apply the configuration changes.

- Step 4: Change the AWS cloud region and repeat the remediation process for other regions.
