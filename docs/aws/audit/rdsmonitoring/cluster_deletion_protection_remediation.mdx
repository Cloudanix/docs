How to enable Cluster Deletion Protection?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: On the left Menu, under Amazon RDS, click Databases.

- Step 2: Select the database cluster that you want to reconfigure (see Audit section part I to identify the right Amazon Aurora resource).

- Step 3: Click the Modify button from the dashboard top menu.

- Step 4: On the Modify DB Cluster: cluster-identifier page, in the Deletion protection section, select Enable deletion protection checkbox to activate Deletion Protection for the selected Amazon Aurora cluster and click continue.

- Step 5: Within the modifications section summary, review the configuration changes that you want to apply to the cluster.

- Step 6: In the Scheduling of modifications section, perform one of the following actions based on your requirements:
  A: Select Apply during the next scheduled maintenance window to apply the changes automatically during the next scheduled maintenance.
  B: Select Apply immediately to apply the changes right away. With this option, any pending modifications will be asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless of the maintenance window setting for this Aurora database cluster.
  Note that any changes available in the pending modifications queue are also applied. If any of the pending modifications require downtime, choosing this option can cause unexpected downtime for your application.

- Step 7: Click Modify DB Cluster to apply changes.
