How to free up storage space in RDS Database?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the navigation panel, under RDS Dashboard section, choose Instances and Select the RDS database instance that you want to reconfigure (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource).

- Step 2: Click the Instance Actions button from the dashboard top menu and select Modify.

- Step 3: On the Modify DB Instance: instance identifier page, under Instance Specifications section, increase the existing storage space (in gigabytes) by entering a new value inside the Allocated Storage box.

- Step 4: At the bottom of the page, check Apply Immediately to apply the allocated storage changes immediately.

- Step 5: Click Continue to access the database instance review page.

- Step 6: Review the storage changes made for the selected instance, then click Modify DB Instance. During the resize process the instance status should change from available to modifying and back to available (it may take few minutes depending on the database instance size and configuration). Once the scaling process is complete, the RDS instance storage size should be updated on the details panel.
