How to use General Purpose SSDs instead of IOPS SSDs?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 2: In the left navigation panel, under RDS Dashboard, click Instances.

- Step 3: Select the RDS instance that you want to modify (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource).

- Step 4: Click Instance Actions button from the dashboard top menu and select Take Snapshot to create a database snapshot (backup).

- Step 5: On the Take DB Snapshot page, in the Snapshot Name box, enter a unique name for the database backup then click Take Snapshot to send the request.

- Step 6: Go back to the Instances page and select again the RDS instance that you want to modify.

- Step 7: Click Instance Actions button from the dashboard top menu and select Modify.

- Step 8: On the Modify DB Instance: instance identifier page, perform the following actions:
  A: Select General Purpose SSD from the Storage Type dropdown list.
  B: In the Allocated Storage box, enter the instance storage size in GB required to match the IOPS number previously set for the RDS database instance.
  C: At the bottom of the page select Apply Immediately checkbox to apply the storage type change immediately and click continue. (!) IMPORTANT: when you convert (modify) the instance storage type, an immediate outage will occur if a custom parameter group is used. If the selected database instance is used in production consider leaving Apply Immediately option disabled before applying the changes in order to avoid any downtime. If Apply Immediately is not selected, the instance storage type change will be processed during the next maintenance window.

- Step 9: Review the storage type changes and click Modify DB Instance. During the modification process the instance status should change from available to modifying and back to available (it may take few minutes depending on the instance configuration).

- Step 10: Change the AWS region and repeat the process for other regions.
