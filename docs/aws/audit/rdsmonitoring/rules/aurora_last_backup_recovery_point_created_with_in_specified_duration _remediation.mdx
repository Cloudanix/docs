1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the RDS dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu and then selecting "RDS" under the "Database" category.
3. In the RDS dashboard, select "Databases" from the left-hand side menu. This will display a list of all your DB instances.
4. For each Aurora DB cluster, check the "Latest restorable time" field under the "Details" section. This field indicates the most recent time to which you can restore the DB cluster. If this field is not recent or does not exist, it means the DB cluster does not have a recovery point.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. **List all DB Clusters**: Use the `describe-db-clusters` command to list all the DB clusters in your AWS account. The command is as follows:

    ```
    aws rds describe-db-clusters --query 'DBClusters[*].[DBClusterIdentifier]' --output text
    ```

    This command will return a list of all DB cluster identifiers.

3. **Check Recovery Point**: For each DB cluster identifier returned from the previous step, use the `describe-db-cluster-snapshots` command to list all the snapshots of the DB cluster. The command is as follows:

    ```
    aws rds describe-db-cluster-snapshots --db-cluster-identifier <DBClusterIdentifier> --query 'DBClusterSnapshots[*].[SnapshotCreateTime]' --output text
    ```

    Replace `<DBClusterIdentifier>` with the actual DB cluster identifier. This command will return a list of snapshot creation times.

4. **Analyze the Output**: If the `describe-db-cluster-snapshots` command returns no results or the latest snapshot is older than your recovery point objective, then the DB cluster does not have a recovery point. If the command returns at least one snapshot and the latest snapshot is within your recovery point objective, then the DB cluster has a recovery point.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: The first step is to import the necessary libraries in your Python script. You will need the `boto3` library, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc.

```python
import boto3
```

2. **Create a Session**: The next step is to create a session using your AWS credentials. You can do this by using the `Session` function in the `boto3` library. Replace `'my_access_key'`, `'my_secret_key'`, and `'my_region'` with your actual AWS credentials.

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='my_access_key',
    aws_secret_access_key='my_secret_key',
    region_name='my_region'
)
```

3. **Connect to the RDS Service**: Now that you have a session, you can connect to the RDS service. You can do this by using the `client` function in your session object.

```python
rds = session.client('rds')
```

4. **Check for Recovery Point**: Finally, you can check for the recovery point of your Aurora DB clusters. You can do this by using the `describe_db_clusters` function in your RDS client object. This function returns a list of DB clusters. For each DB cluster, you can check the `EarliestRestorableTime` attribute. If this attribute is not set, then the DB cluster does not have a recovery point.

```python
clusters = rds.describe_db_clusters()
for cluster in clusters['DBClusters']:
    if 'EarliestRestorableTime' not in cluster:
        print(f"DB cluster {cluster['DBClusterIdentifier']} does not have a recovery point.")
```

This script will print out the identifiers of all DB clusters that do not have a recovery point.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of Aurora DB Clusters not having a Recovery Point in AWS RDS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and log in to your account.

2. **Navigate to RDS Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top left corner of the console and select "RDS" under the Database category.

3. **Select the Aurora DB Cluster**: In the RDS dashboard, locate the Aurora DB Cluster that needs to have a Recovery Point and click on its name to select it.

4. **Enable Automated Backups**:
   - In the navigation pane on the left, click on "Backup" under the "Maintenance & backups" section.
   - Click on the "Modify" button to edit the cluster settings.
   - Scroll down to the "Backup" section and ensure that "Backup retention period" is set to a value greater than 0. This will enable automated backups for the Aurora DB Cluster.
   - You can also enable the "Backup window" setting to specify the daily time range when backups can start.

5. **Create a Manual Snapshot** (Optional):
   - If you want to create a manual snapshot of the Aurora DB Cluster, you can do so by clicking on the "Snapshots" tab in the RDS dashboard.
   - Click on the "Create snapshot" button and follow the on-screen instructions to create a manual snapshot of the Aurora DB Cluster.

6. **Verify the Configuration**:
   - Once you have enabled automated backups and optionally created a manual snapshot, verify the configuration by checking the "Latest restorable time" in the RDS dashboard.
   - The presence of a recovery point indicates that automated backups are enabled for the Aurora DB Cluster.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of Aurora DB Clusters not having a Recovery Point in AWS RDS using the AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of Aurora DB clusters not having a recovery point in AWS RDS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Aurora DB cluster without a recovery point:**
   Run the following AWS CLI command to list all the Aurora DB clusters in your AWS account:
   ```
   aws rds describe-db-clusters
   ```

2. **Enable backups for the Aurora DB cluster:**
   Run the following AWS CLI command to modify the Aurora DB cluster to enable backups:
   ```
   aws rds modify-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier <your-db-cluster-identifier> --backup-retention-period <desired-retention-period>
   ```
   Replace `<your-db-cluster-identifier>` with the actual identifier of the Aurora DB cluster and `<desired-retention-period>` with the number of days you want to retain backups.

3. **Verify the backup configuration:**
   Run the following AWS CLI command to describe the modified Aurora DB cluster and verify that backups are enabled:
   ```
   aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier <your-db-cluster-identifier>
   ```

4. **Monitor the backups:**
   After enabling backups for the Aurora DB cluster, monitor the backups regularly to ensure that they are being created successfully and that you have recovery points available.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Aurora DB clusters not having a recovery point in AWS RDS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration and ensure that Aurora DB Clusters have a recovery point set in AWS RDS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Boto3**: Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python. You can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create a Python script** with the following code to enable point-in-time recovery for your Aurora DB Cluster:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize the RDS client
   rds_client = boto3.client('rds')

   # Specify the DB Cluster identifier
   db_cluster_identifier = 'your-db-cluster-identifier'

   # Enable point-in-time recovery for the DB Cluster
   response = rds_client.modify_db_cluster(
       DBClusterIdentifier=db_cluster_identifier,
       BackupRetentionPeriod=7,  # Set the retention period in days
       ApplyImmediately=True
   )

   print("Point-in-time recovery enabled for Aurora DB Cluster:", db_cluster_identifier)
   ```

3. **Replace `'your-db-cluster-identifier'`** with the actual identifier of your Aurora DB Cluster.

4. **Run the Python script** to enable point-in-time recovery for your Aurora DB Cluster:
   ```bash
   python enable_point_in_time_recovery.py
   ```

5. **Verify the configuration** by checking the AWS Management Console or running describe-db-clusters API call to ensure that the point-in-time recovery is enabled for your Aurora DB Cluster.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration and ensure that your Aurora DB Cluster has a recovery point set in AWS RDS.
