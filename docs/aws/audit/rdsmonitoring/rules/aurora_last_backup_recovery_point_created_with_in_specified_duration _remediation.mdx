### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the RDS dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu and then selecting "RDS" under the "Database" category.
3. In the RDS dashboard, select "Databases" from the left-hand menu. This will display a list of all your DB instances.
4. For each Aurora DB cluster, check the "Latest restorable time" field. This field indicates the most recent time to which you can restore the DB cluster. If this field is not recent or is not available, it means the DB cluster does not have a recovery point.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all DB clusters: Use the `describe-db-clusters` command to list all your DB clusters. This command returns information about provisioned Aurora DB clusters. The command syntax is as follows:
   ```
   aws rds describe-db-clusters --region your-region-name
   ```
   Replace 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region.

3. Check the Backup Retention Period: For each DB cluster, check the `BackupRetentionPeriod` attribute. This attribute specifies the number of days for which automated backups are retained. If the `BackupRetentionPeriod` is set to 0, the DB cluster does not have a recovery point. The command syntax is as follows:
   ```
   aws rds describe-db-clusters --region your-region-name --query 'DBClusters[*].[DBClusterIdentifier,BackupRetentionPeriod]'
   ```
   This command will return a list of all DB clusters along with their backup retention periods.

4. Filter DB Clusters without Recovery Point: You can filter the DB clusters that do not have a recovery point by adding a `--query` parameter to the previous command. The command syntax is as follows:
   ```
   aws rds describe-db-clusters --region your-region-name --query 'DBClusters[?BackupRetentionPeriod==`0`].[DBClusterIdentifier,BackupRetentionPeriod]'
   ```
   This command will return a list of all DB clusters that do not have a recovery point.

#### Using Python

To check if Aurora DB clusters have a recovery point in RDS using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the Boto3 library in Python:**
   Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set up AWS credentials and region for development:**
   You need to set up your AWS credentials and the AWS region to use. You can do this in several ways, but the simplest is to store them in the ~/.aws/credentials file, which might look like this:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```
   Then, set a default region in the AWS configuration file, which is located by default at ~/.aws/config:
   ```
   [default]
   region=us-east-1
   ```

3. **Create a Python script to list all the DB clusters and their backup retention period:**
   You can use the `describe_db_clusters()` function to retrieve all the DB clusters and their details. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_db_clusters():
       client = boto3.client('rds')
       response = client.describe_db_clusters()
       for db_cluster in response['DBClusters']:
           print(f"DB Cluster: {db_cluster['DBClusterIdentifier']}, Backup Retention Period: {db_cluster['BackupRetentionPeriod']}")

   list_db_clusters()
   ```
   This script will print the DB cluster identifier and its backup retention period. If the backup retention period is 0, it means that the DB cluster does not have a recovery point.

4. **Analyze the output:**
   After running the script, you will get a list of all DB clusters and their backup retention periods. If any DB cluster has a backup retention period of 0, it means that the DB cluster does not have a recovery point. You should consider enabling backup for such DB clusters to ensure data durability and continuity.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Aurora DB Clusters not having a Recovery Point in AWS RDS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and log in to your account.

2. **Navigate to RDS Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top left corner of the console and select "RDS" under the Database category.

3. **Select the Aurora DB Cluster**: In the RDS dashboard, locate the Aurora DB Cluster that needs to have a Recovery Point and click on its name to select it.

4. **Enable Automated Backups**:
   - In the navigation pane on the left, click on "Backup" under the "Maintenance & backups" section.
   - Click on the "Modify" button to edit the cluster settings.
   - Scroll down to the "Backup" section and ensure that "Backup retention period" is set to a value greater than 0. This will enable automated backups for the Aurora DB Cluster.
   - You can also enable the "Backup window" setting to specify the daily time range when backups can start.

5. **Create a Manual Snapshot** (Optional):
   - If you want to create a manual snapshot of the Aurora DB Cluster, you can do so by clicking on the "Snapshots" tab in the RDS dashboard.
   - Click on the "Create snapshot" button and follow the on-screen instructions to create a manual snapshot of the Aurora DB Cluster.

6. **Verify the Configuration**:
   - Once you have enabled automated backups and optionally created a manual snapshot, verify the configuration by checking the "Latest restorable time" in the RDS dashboard.
   - The presence of a recovery point indicates that automated backups are enabled for the Aurora DB Cluster.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of Aurora DB Clusters not having a Recovery Point in AWS RDS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Aurora DB clusters not having a recovery point in AWS RDS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Aurora DB cluster without a recovery point:**
   Run the following AWS CLI command to list all the Aurora DB clusters in your AWS account:
   ```
   aws rds describe-db-clusters
   ```

2. **Enable backups for the Aurora DB cluster:**
   Run the following AWS CLI command to modify the Aurora DB cluster to enable backups:
   ```
   aws rds modify-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier <your-db-cluster-identifier> --backup-retention-period <desired-retention-period>
   ```
   Replace `<your-db-cluster-identifier>` with the actual identifier of the Aurora DB cluster and `<desired-retention-period>` with the number of days you want to retain backups.

3. **Verify the backup configuration:**
   Run the following AWS CLI command to describe the modified Aurora DB cluster and verify that backups are enabled:
   ```
   aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier <your-db-cluster-identifier>
   ```

   db_cluster_identifier = 'your-db-cluster-identifier'

   # Enable point-in-time recovery for the DB Cluster
   response = rds_client.modify_db_cluster(
       DBClusterIdentifier=db_cluster_identifier,
       BackupRetentionPeriod=7,  # Set the retention period in days
       ApplyImmediately=True
   )

   print("Point-in-time recovery enabled for Aurora DB Cluster:", db_cluster_identifier)
   ```

3. **Replace `'your-db-cluster-identifier'`** with the actual identifier of your Aurora DB Cluster.

4. **Run the Python script** to enable point-in-time recovery for your Aurora DB Cluster:
   ```bash
   python enable_point_in_time_recovery.py
   ```

5. **Verify the configuration** by checking the AWS Management Console or running describe-db-clusters API call to ensure that the point-in-time recovery is enabled for your Aurora DB Cluster.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration and ensure that your Aurora DB Cluster has a recovery point set in AWS RDS.
