### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Login to AWS Management Console: First, you need to sign in to your AWS Management Console. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the RDS dashboard.

2. Navigate to RDS Dashboard: From the AWS Management Console, navigate to the RDS service. This can be done by typing "RDS" into the search bar at the top of the console and selecting "RDS" from the dropdown menu.

3. Check RDS Instances: Once you're in the RDS dashboard, click on "Databases" in the left-hand navigation pane. This will display a list of all your RDS instances. 

4. Monitor Utilization Metrics: For each RDS instance, you can check its utilization by selecting the instance and then clicking on the "Monitoring" tab. Here, you can view various metrics such as CPU utilization, free storage space, and read/write operations. If the CPU utilization is consistently low (for example, below 20%), the RDS instance may be underutilized.

#### Using CLI

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you can start, make sure you have AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions. You can install it using pip (Python package installer). 

    ```
    pip install awscli
    ```
    Then, configure it using the following command and provide your AWS credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key), default region name, and default output format when prompted.

    ```
    aws configure
    ```

2. **List all RDS Instances**: Use the AWS CLI command `describe-db-instances` to list all the RDS instances. 

    ```
    aws rds describe-db-instances
    ```
    This command will return a JSON output with the details of all RDS instances.

3. **Check CPU Utilization**: For each RDS instance, check the CPU utilization. You can use the `get-metric-statistics` command to retrieve the CPU utilization metrics. Replace `<DBInstanceIdentifier>` with the identifier of your RDS instance.

    ```
    aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/RDS --metric-name CPUUtilization --dimensions Name=DBInstanceIdentifier,Value=<DBInstanceIdentifier> --start-time 2021-01-01T00:00:00Z --end-time 2021-01-02T23:59:59Z --period 3600 --statistics Average
    ```
    This command will return the average CPU utilization for the specified period.

4. **Analyze the Output**: If the CPU utilization is consistently low (for example, less than 20%) over a long period of time, the RDS instance may be underutilized. You may need to consider downgrading the instance type or check if the instance is necessary. 

Remember, these steps only provide a basic guideline. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to adjust the commands or the analysis method.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this in several ways, but the simplest is to fill out the ~/.aws/credentials file:

   ```python
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

2. Use Boto3 to connect to AWS RDS service: Once Boto3 is installed and configured, you can write a Python script to connect to AWS RDS service. Here is a simple example:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a low-level service client
   client = boto3.client('rds')

   # Call describe_db_instances() method to retrieve the details of all RDS instances
   response = client.describe_db_instances()
   ```

3. Analyze the utilization of RDS instances: The response from describe_db_instances() method contains the details of all RDS instances. You can analyze the 'DBInstances' field in the response to check the utilization of each RDS instance. Here is a simple example:

   ```python
   for instance in response['DBInstances']:
       # Check if the instance is underutilized
       if instance['CPUUtilization'] < 20 and instance['FreeableMemory'] > (instance['TotalMemory'] * 0.8):
           print(f"RDS instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} is underutilized.")
   ```

4. Schedule the script to run periodically: You can schedule the Python script to run periodically (for example, every hour) using a task scheduler like cron on Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows. This way, you can continuously monitor the utilization of RDS instances and detect any underutilized instances.
