How to identify any underutilized Amazon RDS database instances?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the navigation panel, under RDS Dashboard section, choose Instances.

- Step 2: Select the underused RDS database instance you want to resize and click the Instance Actions button (dashboard top menu) and select Modify.

- Step 3: On the Modify DB Instance: instance identifier page, under Instance Specifications section, select the database instance type to downsize to (e.g. db.m3.medium) from the DB Instance Class dropdown list (see RDS Instance Types page available at this URL to help you choose the right database instance type).

- Step 4: At the bottom, check Apply Immediately to apply the instance type (class) change immediately.

- Step 5: Click Continue to access DB instance review page.

- Step 6: Review the type/class changes then click Modify DB Instance. During the resize process the instance status should change from available to modifying and back to available (May take a few minutes depending on the database instance configuration). Once the downsize is complete, the RDS instance type should be updated on the details panel.
