2. Click on the name of the RDS instance for which you want to enable Performance Insights.
3. In the instance details page, click on the "Configuration" tab.
4. Under the "Database options" section, locate the "Performance Insights" option.
5. Click on the "Edit" button next to the "Performance Insights" option.
6. In the "Modify DB instance" window, select the checkbox for "Enable Performance Insights".

8. Optionally, you can also select the checkbox for "Auto enable" to automatically enable Performance Insights for new instances that meet the criteria you set.
9. Click on the "Apply immediately" checkbox to apply the changes immediately. If you don't select this option, the changes will be applied during the next maintenance window for the RDS instance.
10. Click on the "Modify DB instance" button to save the changes and enable Performance Insights.
