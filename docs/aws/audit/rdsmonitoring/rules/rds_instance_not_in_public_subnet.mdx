### More Info:

No AWS RDS database instances should be provisioned inside VPC public subnets in order to protect them from direct exposure to the Internet

### Risk Level

High

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

SOC2, HITRUST, GDPR, NISTCSF, PCIDSS, FedRAMP

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration of RDS DB instances being provisioned in VPC public subnets in AWS Console:

1. Open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Databases".
3. Select the RDS DB instance that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Modify" button.
5. In the "Network & Security" section, select the "VPC" that contains the private subnet(s) where you want to move your RDS DB instance.
6. In the "Subnet group" section, select the subnet group that only contains private subnets.
7. Click on the "Apply immediately" checkbox to immediately apply the changes.
8. Review the changes and click on the "Modify DB instance" button to save the changes.

After following these steps, your RDS DB instance will be moved to a private subnet within the VPC, and it will no longer be accessible from the public internet.

#### Using CLI

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration of provisioning RDS DB Instances in VPC Public Subnets for AWS using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the RDS instances that are provisioned in VPC public subnets. You can use the following AWS CLI command to list all the RDS instances in your account:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances
   ```

2. Note down the RDS instances that are provisioned in VPC public subnets.

3. Create a new private subnet in your VPC where you want to move the RDS instance. You can use the following AWS CLI command to create a new private subnet:

   ```
   aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block <cidr-block> --availability-zone <availability-zone>
   ```

   Replace `<vpc-id>`, `<cidr-block>`, and `<availability-zone>` with the appropriate values for your VPC.

4. Modify the RDS instance to move it to the newly created private subnet. You can use the following AWS CLI command to modify the RDS instance:

   ```
   aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <db-instance-identifier> --vpc-security-group-ids <vpc-security-group-ids> --db-subnet-group-name <db-subnet-group-name>
   ```

   Replace `<db-instance-identifier>`, `<vpc-security-group-ids>`, and `<db-subnet-group-name>` with the appropriate values for your RDS instance.

   - `<db-instance-identifier>`: The identifier of the RDS instance to be modified.
   - `<vpc-security-group-ids>`: The security group IDs that are associated with the RDS instance.
   - `<db-subnet-group-name>`: The name of the DB subnet group that the RDS instance should be moved to.

5. Verify that the RDS instance has been moved to the new private subnet. You can use the following AWS CLI command to describe the RDS instance:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <db-instance-identifier>
   ```

   Replace `<db-instance-identifier>` with the identifier of your RDS instance.

6. Repeat steps 4-5 for all the RDS instances that were provisioned in VPC public subnets.

That's it! This should remediate the misconfiguration of provisioning RDS DB Instances in VPC Public Subnets for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of RDS DB Instances being provisioned in VPC Public Subnets in AWS using Python, follow the below steps:

1. Create a new VPC private subnet: First, create a new VPC private subnet in the same VPC as the public subnet where the RDS instance is currently running. This new subnet should be configured as a private subnet, which means it should not have a route to the Internet Gateway.

2. Create a new DB subnet group: Next, create a new DB subnet group that includes the newly created private subnet and any other private subnets you want to use for RDS instances. This DB subnet group should be associated with the RDS instance.

3. Modify the RDS instance: Modify the RDS instance to use the new DB subnet group. This can be done using the modify_db_instance() method of the boto3 RDS client. The code snippet for modifying the RDS instance is as follows:

```
import boto3

rds = boto3.client('rds')

response = rds.modify_db_instance(
    DBInstanceIdentifier='your-db-instance-id',
    DBSubnetGroupName='your-db-subnet-group-name'
)
```

Replace 'your-db-instance-id' with the actual identifier of the RDS instance and 'your-db-subnet-group-name' with the name of the newly created DB subnet group.

4. Verify the changes: Verify that the RDS instance is now running in the private subnet by checking the subnet group associated with the RDS instance using the describe_db_instances() method of the boto3 RDS client.

```
import boto3

rds = boto3.client('rds')

response = rds.describe_db_instances(
    DBInstanceIdentifier='your-db-instance-id'
)

print(response['DBInstances'][0]['DBSubnetGroup']['DBSubnetGroupName'])
```

This should return the name of the new DB subnet group that you just created.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of RDS DB Instances being provisioned in VPC Public Subnets in AWS using Python.
