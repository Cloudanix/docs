### More Info:

If your RDS instance and it's security group allows access to everyone by setting 0.0.0.0/0, then it invites malicious users to target your database and make your security posture more vulnerable.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

PCIDSS, NIST

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Instances Should Not Allow Unrestricted In/Outbound Access" in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the RDS service.
3. Select the RDS instance that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Modify" button from the top menu bar.
5. Scroll down to the "Network & Security" section.
6. In the "Security group rules" section, click on the "Edit" button.
7. Remove any inbound or outbound rules that allow unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0).
8. Add new rules to allow access only from trusted sources.
9. Click on the "Save Changes" button to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "RDS Instances Should Not Allow Unrestricted In/Outbound Access" in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Instances Should Not Allow Unrestricted In/Outbound Access" in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Go to the AWS RDS console and identify the RDS instance that has unrestricted inbound/outbound access.

2. Use the AWS CLI command to modify the security group associated with the RDS instance and restrict the inbound/outbound access. For example, to modify the security group to allow access only from a specific IP address, you can use the following command:

```
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <instance-id> --vpc-security-group-ids <security-group-id> --apply-immediately --db-security-groups <security-group-name> --db-parameter-group-name <parameter-group-name>
```

Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the RDS instance, `<security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group that allows access only from a specific IP address, `<security-group-name>` with the name of the security group associated with the RDS instance, and `<parameter-group-name>` with the name of the parameter group associated with the RDS instance.

3. Verify that the security group has been modified successfully and the inbound/outbound access has been restricted.

4. Repeat the above steps for all the RDS instances that have unrestricted inbound/outbound access.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Instances Should Not Allow Unrestricted In/Outbound Access" in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Instances Should Not Allow Unrestricted In/Outbound Access" for AWS using python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Create an AWS session using boto3 library in python.
```
import boto3
session = boto3.session.Session(region_name='us-west-2')
```

Step 2: Get the list of RDS instances in the AWS account.
```
rds_client = session.client('rds')
response = rds_client.describe_db_instances()
db_instances = response['DBInstances']
```

Step 3: Loop through the RDS instances and check if they have unrestricted inbound/outbound access.
```
for db_instance in db_instances:
    db_security_groups = db_instance['VpcSecurityGroups']
    for db_security_group in db_security_groups:
        group_id = db_security_group['VpcSecurityGroupId']
        ec2_client = session.client('ec2')
        response = ec2_client.describe_security_groups(GroupIds=[group_id])
        ip_permissions = response['SecurityGroups'][0]['IpPermissions']
        ip_permissions_egress = response['SecurityGroups'][0]['IpPermissionsEgress']
        if (len(ip_permissions) == 0) or (len(ip_permissions_egress) == 0):
            print(f"RDS Instance {db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} has unrestricted inbound/outbound access.")
```

Step 4: If the RDS instance has unrestricted inbound/outbound access, update its security group to restrict the access.
```
for db_instance in db_instances:
    db_security_groups = db_instance['VpcSecurityGroups']
    for db_security_group in db_security_groups:
        group_id = db_security_group['VpcSecurityGroupId']
        ec2_client = session.client('ec2')
        response = ec2_client.describe_security_groups(GroupIds=[group_id])
        ip_permissions = response['SecurityGroups'][0]['IpPermissions']
        ip_permissions_egress = response['SecurityGroups'][0]['IpPermissionsEgress']
        if (len(ip_permissions) == 0) or (len(ip_permissions_egress) == 0):
            print(f"Updating security group for RDS Instance {db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']}...")
            ec2_client.revoke_security_group_ingress(
                GroupId=group_id,
                IpPermissions=[{'IpProtocol': '-1', 'IpRanges': [{'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'}]}]
            )
            ec2_client.revoke_security_group_egress(
                GroupId=group_id,
                IpPermissions=[{'IpProtocol': '-1', 'IpRanges': [{'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'}]}]
            )
            print(f"Security group updated for RDS Instance {db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']}.")
```

Note: The above steps will identify the RDS instances with unrestricted inbound/outbound access and update their security groups to restrict the access. However, it is important to review the changes made and ensure that they do not impact the functionality of the RDS instances.
