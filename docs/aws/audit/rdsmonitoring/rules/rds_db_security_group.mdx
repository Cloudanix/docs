### Remediation

How to remediate if RDS DB instances or RDS Security Group allows unrestricted inbound and outbound access.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the affected RDS DB instances and Security Groups: Review your RDS instances and associated Security Groups to identify the ones that have unrestricted inbound and outbound access.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "RDS Instances Should Not Allow Unrestricted In/Outbound Access" Policy.)
2. Update Security Group rules: Navigate to the AWS Management Console and go to the EC2 service.
3. Access the Security Groups: From the EC2 dashboard, click on "Security Groups" in the left navigation menu.
4. Review and edit Security Group rules: Locate the Security Group(s) associated with the affected RDS DB instances. Review the inbound and outbound rules defined for each Security Group.
5. Remove or modify unnecessary rules: Identify any rules that allow unrestricted access (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 for IP ranges). Remove or modify these rules to restrict access only to the necessary IP ranges or specific security groups.
6. Apply the changes: Save the updated Security Group configuration to apply the changes.
7. Repeat for all affected Security Groups: If you have multiple Security Groups associated with different RDS instances, repeat the above steps for each affected Security Group.
8. Verify the changes: Once the changes are applied, verify that the Security Group rules now restrict inbound and outbound access as intended.
