<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all RDS instances: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the RDS instances in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier]' --output text
   ```

   This command will return a list of all RDS instance identifiers.

3. Check Enhanced Monitoring for each RDS instance: For each RDS instance, you can check if Enhanced Monitoring is enabled or not by using the following AWS CLI command:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <DBInstanceIdentifier> --query 'DBInstances[*].[MonitoringInterval]' --output text
   ```

   Replace `<DBInstanceIdentifier>` with the identifier of the RDS instance you want to check. This command will return the monitoring interval for the specified RDS instance. If the returned value is '0', it means that Enhanced Monitoring is not enabled for this RDS instance.

4. Automate the process with a script: If you have many RDS instances, it would be more efficient to automate the process with a script. Here is a simple Python script that uses the AWS SDK (boto3) to check if Enhanced Monitoring is enabled for all RDS instances:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a client for the AWS RDS service
   rds = boto3.client('rds')

   # Get a list of all RDS instances
   instances = rds.describe_db_instances()

   # For each RDS instance, check if Enhanced Monitoring is enabled
   for instance in instances['DBInstances']:
       if instance['MonitoringInterval'] == 0:
           print(f"Enhanced Monitoring is not enabled for RDS instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']}")
   ```

   This script will print the identifiers of all RDS instances for which Enhanced Monitoring is not enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can set your credentials for use by Boto3 in several ways. The quickest way to get started is to configure them in the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   You'll be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

3. Write the Python script: The following Python script uses Boto3 to check if Enhanced Monitoring is enabled for RDS instances:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_enhanced_monitoring():
       rds = boto3.client('rds')
       response = rds.describe_db_instances()
       for instance in response['DBInstances']:
           if instance['MonitoringInterval'] == 0:
               print(f"Enhanced Monitoring is not enabled for RDS instance: {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']}")
           else:
               print(f"Enhanced Monitoring is enabled for RDS instance: {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']}")

   check_enhanced_monitoring()
   ```

   This script retrieves a list of all RDS instances and checks the 'MonitoringInterval' attribute for each instance. If the 'MonitoringInterval' is 0, it means that Enhanced Monitoring is not enabled for that instance.

4. Run the Python script: You can run the Python script from your terminal:

   ```bash
   python check_enhanced_monitoring.py
   ```

   The script will print out the RDS instances for which Enhanced Monitoring is not enabled.
