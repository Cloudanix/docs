How to enable RDS Database Automated Backups?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the navigation panel, under RDS Dashboard, click Instances and select the RDS instance that you want to examine.

- Step 2: Click Instance Actions button from the dashboard top menu and select Modify.

- Step 3: On the Modify DB Instance: instance identifier page, under Backup section, select a positive number (between 1 and 35) from the Backup Retention Period dropdown list. The value set represents the number of days for which instance automated backups are retained.

- Step 4: At the bottom of the page, check Apply Immediately to apply the changes immediately and click continue. (!) IMPORTANT: when you change the retention period from 0 to a non-zero value an immediate outage will occur so if the selected database instance is used in production consider leaving Apply Immediately option disabled before applying the changes in order to avoid any downtime. If Apply Immediately is not selected, the feature will be enabled during the next maintenance window.

- Step 5: Review the changes and click Modify DB Instance. Once the feature is enabled, the Automated Backups status should change to Enabled:
  and a new snapshot of the instance will be created.
