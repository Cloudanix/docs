<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To ensure that automated backups are enabled for your Amazon RDS instances using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Describe the RDS Instances**:
   First, identify the RDS instances for which you want to enable automated backups. Use the following command to list your RDS instances:
   ```sh
   aws rds describe-db-instances
   ```

2. **Modify the RDS Instance**:
   Use the `modify-db-instance` command to enable automated backups for a specific RDS instance. Replace `<db-instance-identifier>` with your RDS instance identifier and set the `--backup-retention-period` to a value greater than 0 (e.g., 7 days):
   ```sh
   aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <db-instance-identifier> --backup-retention-period 7
   ```

3. **Apply Changes Immediately**:
   If you want the changes to take effect immediately, include the `--apply-immediately` flag:
   ```sh
   aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <db-instance-identifier> --backup-retention-period 7 --apply-immediately
   ```

4. **Verify the Configuration**:
   After modifying the RDS instance, verify that the automated backups are enabled by describing the instance again:
   ```sh
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <db-instance-identifier>
   ```
   Check the `BackupRetentionPeriod` field in the output to ensure it is set to the desired number of days.

By following these steps, you can ensure that automated backups are enabled for your Amazon RDS instances using the AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of not having automated backups enabled in Amazon RDS using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here are the steps to ensure automated backups are enabled:

1. **Install Boto3 Library**:
   Ensure you have the Boto3 library installed. If not, you can install it using pip.
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by directly configuring the `~/.aws/credentials` file.

3. **Create a Python Script to Enable Automated Backups**:
   Write a Python script that checks and enables automated backups for your RDS instances.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon RDS
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='YOUR_REGION'
   )

   rds = session.client('rds')

   # Function to enable automated backups
   def enable_automated_backups(db_instance_identifier):
       try:
           response = rds.modify_db_instance(
               DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance_identifier,
               BackupRetentionPeriod=7  # Set the retention period as per your requirement
           )
           print(f"Automated backups enabled for {db_instance_identifier}")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Error enabling automated backups for {db_instance_identifier}: {e}")

   # List all RDS instances and enable automated backups if not already enabled
   def ensure_automated_backups():
       try:
           instances = rds.describe_db_instances()
           for instance in instances['DBInstances']:
               db_instance_identifier = instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']
               backup_retention_period = instance['BackupRetentionPeriod']
               if backup_retention_period == 0:
                   enable_automated_backups(db_instance_identifier)
               else:
                   print(f"Automated backups already enabled for {db_instance_identifier}")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Error describing RDS instances: {e}")

   # Run the function
   ensure_automated_backups()
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to ensure that automated backups are enabled for all your RDS instances.
   ```bash
   python enable_rds_backups.py
   ```

This script will check all your RDS instances and enable automated backups for those that do not have it enabled. Make sure to replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'`, `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'`, and `'YOUR_REGION'` with your actual AWS credentials and region.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Databases".

3. Choose the name of the DB instance that you want to check.

4. In the "Details" section, look for the "Backup" section. Here, you can see the "Backup Retention Period". If the value is 0 days, it means that automated backups are not enabled for the RDS instance.

5. Also, check the "Backup Window" setting. If it's set to "No Preference", it means that automated backups can occur at any time during the day. This could potentially impact the performance of your DB instance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all RDS instances: Once your AWS CLI is set up, you can list all your RDS instances by running the following command:
   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with the details of all your RDS instances.

3. Check backup configuration: To check if automated backups are enabled for each RDS instance, you need to look at the "BackupRetentionPeriod" attribute in the JSON output. If the value of this attribute is greater than 0, it means that automated backups are enabled for that RDS instance. You can use the following command to filter out the DB instance identifier and its backup retention period:
   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,BackupRetentionPeriod]'
   ```
4. Analyze the output: Finally, you need to analyze the output of the previous command. If you find any RDS instance with a "BackupRetentionPeriod" of 0, it means that automated backups are not enabled for that instance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The Boto3 library is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to interact with AWS services. You can configure it in several ways. The easiest way is to use the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   It will prompt you for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format. Enter the details accordingly.

3. Write the Python script: Now, you can write a Python script to check if automated backups are enabled for RDS instances. Here is a simple script that does this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_rds_backup():
       rds = boto3.client('rds')
       instances = rds.describe_db_instances()
       for instance in instances['DBInstances']:
           if instance['BackupRetentionPeriod'] <= 0:
               print(f"RDS instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} does not have automated backups enabled.")
           else:
               print(f"RDS instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} has automated backups enabled.")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_rds_backup()
   ```

   This script first creates a client for the RDS service. It then retrieves a list of all RDS instances. For each instance, it checks the 'BackupRetentionPeriod' attribute. If this attribute is 0 or less, it means that automated backups are not enabled for that instance.

4. Run the Python script: Finally, you can run the Python script using the Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python check_rds_backup.py
   ```

   The script will print out the RDS instances that do not have automated backups enabled.
