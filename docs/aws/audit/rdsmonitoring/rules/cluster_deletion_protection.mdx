How to enable Cluster Deletion Protection?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the Amazon RDS console by navigating to the "Services" menu and selecting "RDS" under the "Database" section.
3. Select the RDS cluster for which you want to enable deletion protection.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Cluster Deletion Protection Should Be Enabled" Policy.)
4. In the cluster details page, click on the "Modify" button.
5. In the "Modify DB Cluster" page, scroll down to the "Deletion protection" section.
6. Check the box next to "Enable deletion protection" to enable deletion protection for the cluster.
7. Optionally, you can also check the box next to "Enable final DB snapshot" if you want to require a final DB snapshot to be taken before deleting the cluster. This can help in preserving a backup of the cluster's data.
8. Click on the "Apply immediately" button to save the changes and enable deletion protection.
