### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Serverless Log Exports Should Be Enabled" for AWS using the AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS console and navigate to the AWS Lambda service.

2. Select the function for which you want to enable log exports.

3. In the Function Overview section, click on the "Add Trigger" button.

4. Select the "CloudWatch Logs" trigger from the list of triggers.

5. Configure the trigger by selecting an existing log group or creating a new one.

6. In the "Filter name" field, enter a name for the filter.

7. In the "Filter pattern" field, enter the filter pattern for the logs you want to export.

8. In the "Destination" section, select "Lambda function" and choose the function to which you want to export the logs.

9. Click on the "Create function" button to create the trigger and enable log exports for the selected function.

10. Repeat the above steps for all the functions in your AWS account that require log exports to be enabled.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Serverless Log Exports Should Be Enabled" for AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Serverless Log Exports Should Be Enabled" for AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the below command to enable serverless log exports for all the Lambda functions in the AWS account:

```
aws lambda update-account-configuration --account-configuration '{"accountLogDestination": {"destinationArn": "<your-destination-arn>", "logDestinationType": "CloudWatchLogs"}}'
```

Note: Replace `<your-destination-arn>` with the ARN of the CloudWatch Logs destination where you want to export the logs.

3. Verify the configuration by running the below command:

```
aws lambda get-account-settings
```

This command will return the current account settings for AWS Lambda, including the log export destination.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Serverless Log Exports Should Be Enabled" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Serverless Log Exports Should Be Enabled" for AWS using Python, follow the below steps:

1. Import the required Python libraries such as `boto3` and `json`.

```python
import boto3
import json
```

2. Create an AWS `CloudFormation` client object using the `boto3` library.

```python
cf_client = boto3.client('cloudformation')
```

3. Get the list of all the stacks in your AWS account using the `describe_stacks` method of the `CloudFormation` client object.

```python
stacks = cf_client.describe_stacks()
```

4. Loop through all the stacks and get the list of all the AWS Lambda functions using the `list_functions` method of the `Lambda` client object.

```python
lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')
for stack in stacks['Stacks']:
    stack_name = stack['StackName']
    functions = lambda_client.list_functions()
```

5. Loop through all the Lambda functions and check if the `CloudWatchLogsRoleArn` attribute is set. If it is not set, then enable the serverless log exports by updating the function configuration using the `update_function_configuration` method of the `Lambda` client object.

```python
for function in functions['Functions']:
    function_name = function['FunctionName']
    function_arn = function['FunctionArn']
    try:
        function_configuration = lambda_client.get_function_configuration(FunctionName=function_name)
        if 'CloudWatchLogsRoleArn' not in function_configuration:
            lambda_client.update_function_configuration(
                FunctionName=function_name,
                Role='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/lambda-cloudwatch-logs-role',
                Environment={
                    'Variables': {
                        'LOG_LEVEL': 'INFO'
                    }
                }
            )
            print(f"Enabled serverless log exports for function {function_name}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error enabling serverless log exports for function {function_name}: {str(e)}")
```

6. Replace the `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/lambda-cloudwatch-logs-role` with the appropriate IAM role ARN that has permission to write logs to CloudWatch.

7. Save the Python script and run it to remediate the misconfiguration.

Note: The above Python script is just an example. You may need to modify it based on your specific requirements and environment.
