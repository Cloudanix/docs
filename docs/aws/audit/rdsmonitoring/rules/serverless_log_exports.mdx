   Ensure that the general log is enabled and exported to CloudWatch Logs.
   ```sh
   aws rds modify-db-instance \
       --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> \
       --cloudwatch-logs-export-configuration '{"EnableLogTypes":["general"]}'
   ```

2. **Enable Slow Query Log Export to CloudWatch:**
   Ensure that the slow query log is enabled and exported to CloudWatch Logs.
   ```sh
   aws rds modify-db-instance \
       --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> \
       --cloudwatch-logs-export-configuration '{"EnableLogTypes":["slowquery"]}'
   ```

3. **Enable Error Log Export to CloudWatch:**
   Ensure that the error log is enabled and exported to CloudWatch Logs.
   ```sh
   aws rds modify-db-instance \
       --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> \
       --cloudwatch-logs-export-configuration '{"EnableLogTypes":["error"]}'
   ```

   Use the following Python script to enable log exports for your RDS instances. This script will iterate through all your RDS instances and enable the necessary log exports.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon RDS
   client = boto3.client('rds')

   # List all RDS instances
   response = client.describe_db_instances()

   # Iterate over each RDS instance
   for db_instance in response['DBInstances']:
       db_instance_identifier = db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']
       # Check if log exports are already enabled
       if 'EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports' not in db_instance or 'error' in db_instance['EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports']:
           # Enable log exports
           client.modify_db_instance(
               DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance_identifier,
               CloudwatchLogsExportConfiguration={
                   'EnableLogTypes': ['error', 'general', 'slowquery', 'audit']
               },
               ApplyImmediately=True
           )
           print(f"Enabled log exports for RDS instance: {db_instance_identifier}")
       else:
           print(f"Log exports already enabled for RDS instance: {db_instance_identifier}")
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script in your Python environment to ensure that log exports are enabled for all your RDS instances.

   ```bash
   python enable_rds_log_exports.py
   ```

This script will ensure that the necessary log exports are enabled for all your RDS instances, thereby preventing the misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the RDS dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu, then selecting "RDS" under the "Database" category.
3. In the navigation pane on the left, click on "Databases".
4. Select the RDS instance that you want to check.
5. In the details pane, under the "Configuration" tab, look for the "Log exports" section. If the "Log exports" section is not present or does not list the necessary logs (such as "audit" or "error"), then Serverless Log Exports are not enabled for that RDS instance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the RDS instances.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the RDS instances using the following command:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier]' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all RDS instance identifiers.

3. For each RDS instance, you can check if the log exports are enabled using the following command:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <DBInstanceIdentifier> --query 'DBInstances[*].[EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports]' --output text
   ```
   Replace `<DBInstanceIdentifier>` with the actual identifier of the RDS instance. This command will return a list of log types that are being exported to CloudWatch Logs for the specified DB instance.

4. If the output is empty or does not include the necessary log types (for example, "audit" or "error"), then serverless log exports are not enabled for that RDS instance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if Serverless Log Exports are enabled in RDS, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Set up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. **Create a Python script to list all RDS instances:**
   Use the `describe_db_instances` method to get a list of all RDS instances. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_rds_instances():
       rds = boto3.client('rds')
       response = rds.describe_db_instances()
       for instance in response['DBInstances']:
           print("DBInstanceIdentifier: ", instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'])

   list_rds_instances()
   ```

3. **Check if Serverless Log Exports are enabled:**
   For each RDS instance, check if the `EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports` attribute is set. This attribute contains a list of the log types that are being exported to CloudWatch Logs. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_log_exports():
       rds = boto3.client('rds')
       response = rds.describe_db_instances()
       for instance in response['DBInstances']:
           print("DBInstanceIdentifier: ", instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'])
           if 'EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports' in instance:
               print("EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports: ", instance['EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports'])
           else:
               print("EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports: None")

   check_log_exports()
   ```

4. **Interpret the results:**
   If the `EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports` attribute is not set or does not include the log types you are interested in (for example, 'audit' or 'error'), then Serverless Log Exports are not enabled for that RDS instance.
