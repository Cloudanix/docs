How to enable serverless log exports for Amazon RDS?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon RDS service.
2. Click on the name of the RDS instance for which you want to enable serverless log exports.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Serverless Log Exports Should Be Enabled" Policy.)
3. In the instance details page, click on the "Logs" tab.
4. Under the "Database logs" section, click on the "Modify" button.
5. In the "Modify DB instance" window, scroll down to the "Enable enhanced monitoring" section.
6. Select the checkbox for "Enable enhanced monitoring".
7. Choose the desired granularity for the enhanced monitoring data. You can select either "Detailed" or "Basic" depending on your requirements.
8. Scroll down to the "Enable serverless log exports to Amazon S3" section.
9. Select the checkbox for "Enable log exports to an S3 bucket".
10. Choose an existing S3 bucket from the dropdown menu or click on the "Create a new S3 bucket" link to create a new bucket.
11. Specify the prefix for the exported log files. This helps organize the log files within the S3 bucket.
12. Optionally, you can provide an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that grants RDS permission to write logs to the specified S3 bucket. If you don't provide an IAM role, RDS will create a new role with the necessary permissions.
13. Click on the "Apply immediately" checkbox to apply the changes immediately. If you don't select this option, the changes will be applied during the next maintenance window for the RDS instance.
14. Click on the "Modify DB instance" button to save the changes and enable serverless log exports.
15. RDS will now start exporting logs to the specified S3 bucket. You can access the exported logs for analysis and archiving.
