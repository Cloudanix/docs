Broadcasting these logs to CloudWatch allows you to maintain continuous visibility into database activity, query performance and errors within your RDS database instances.

How to enable log exports for Amazon RDS?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon RDS service.
2. Click on the name of the RDS instance for which you want to enable log exports.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Log Exports Should Be Enabled " Policy.)
3. In the instance details page, click on the "Logs" tab.
4. Under the "Database logs" section, click on the "Modify" button.
5. In the "Modify DB instance" window, scroll down to the "Enable CloudWatch Logs exports" section.
6. Select the log types you want to enable for export. Available log types may include error logs, slow query logs, and general logs.
7. Choose the destination CloudWatch Logs group where the logs will be exported. If you don't have an existing group, you can create a new one by clicking on the "Create a new CloudWatch Logs group" link.
8. Specify the IAM role that has the necessary permissions to write logs to the selected CloudWatch Logs group. If you don't have an existing IAM role, you can create a new one by clicking on the "Create a new IAM role" link.
9. Optionally, you can customize the prefix for the log stream name. This helps distinguish log streams when multiple RDS instances are exporting logs to the same CloudWatch Logs group.
10. Click on the "Apply immediately" checkbox to apply the changes immediately. If you don't select this option, the changes will be applied during the next maintenance window for the RDS instance.
11. Click on the "Modify DB instance" button to save the changes and enable log exports.
12. The log exports will now be enabled for the selected log types, and the logs will be exported to the specified CloudWatch Logs group.
13. Access the CloudWatch Logs console to view and analyze the exported RDS logs.
