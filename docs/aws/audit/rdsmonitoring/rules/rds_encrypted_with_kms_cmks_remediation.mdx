### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of using AWS-managed keys instead of Customer-Managed Keys for AWS RDS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Customer-Managed Key (CMK)**:
   - Go to the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) console.
   - Click on "Create key" to create a new CMK.
   - Choose the key creation method (Symmetric key or Asymmetric key) based on your requirements.
   - Define key administrative permissions and key usage permissions.
   - Click on "Finish" to create the CMK.

2. **Update the RDS Instance to use the Customer-Managed Key**:
   - Go to the Amazon RDS console.
   - Select the RDS instance for which you want to update the encryption key.
   - Click on "Modify" to modify the instance settings.
   - In the "Encryption" section, choose the option to encrypt using a Customer-Managed Key.
   - Select the Customer-Managed Key (CMK) that you created in step 1.
   - Click on "Continue" and review the changes.
   - Click on "Modify DB Instance" to apply the changes.

3. **Monitor the Encryption Key Update**:
   - Once you have modified the RDS instance to use the Customer-Managed Key, monitor the instance to ensure that the encryption key update is successful.
   - Check the RDS instance status and logs for any errors related to the encryption key update.
   - Verify that the RDS instance is using the Customer-Managed Key for encryption.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of using AWS-managed keys instead of Customer-Managed Keys for AWS RDS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of using AWS-managed keys for AWS RDS instances and switch to using Customer-Managed Keys, you can follow these steps using the AWS CLI:

1. **Create a Customer Managed Key (CMK)**:
   - Use the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to create a new Customer Managed Key (CMK) if you don't already have one.
   - Run the following command to create a CMK:
     ```
     aws kms create-key --description "Customer Managed Key for RDS Encryption"
     ```
   - Note down the `KeyId` value from the output, as you will need it in the next steps.

2. **Enable encryption with the Customer Managed Key for the RDS instance**:
   - Modify the RDS instance to use the newly created CMK for encryption.
   - Run the following command to modify the RDS instance to use the Customer Managed Key:
     ```
     aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER --kms-key-id YOUR_CMK_KEY_ID
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER` with the identifier of your RDS instance and `YOUR_CMK_KEY_ID` with the `KeyId` of the Customer Managed Key created in step 1.

3. **Verify the encryption settings**:
   - Confirm that the RDS instance is now using the Customer Managed Key for encryption.
   - Run the following command to describe the RDS instance and verify the encryption settings:
     ```
     aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER --query "DBInstances[*].KmsKeyId"
     ```
   - Ensure that the `KmsKeyId` returned in the output matches the `KeyId` of the Customer Managed Key.

4. **Monitor the RDS instance**:
   - Monitor the RDS instance to ensure that there are no issues after switching to Customer Managed Key encryption.
   - Check the RDS instance logs and performance metrics to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of using AWS-managed keys for AWS RDS instances and switch to using Customer-Managed Keys successfully using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate this misconfiguration for AWS RDS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Customer-Managed Key (CMK) in AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**:
   - Use the `boto3` library in Python to create a new CMK in AWS KMS. Here is an example code snippet to create a CMK:

   ```python
   import boto3

   kms_client = boto3.client('kms')

   response = kms_client.create_key(
       Description='My Customer-Managed Key',
       KeyUsage='ENCRYPT_DECRYPT',
       Origin='AWS_KMS',
   )

   cmk_id = response['KeyMetadata']['KeyId']
   ```

2. **Update the RDS instance to use the Customer-Managed Key**:
   - Use the `boto3` library to modify the RDS instance to use the newly created CMK. Here is an example code snippet to update the RDS instance to use the CMK:

   ```python
   rds_client = boto3.client('rds')

   response = rds_client.modify_db_instance(
       DBInstanceIdentifier='your-rds-instance-id',
       KmsKeyId=cmk_id,
   )
   ```

3. **Verify the changes**:
   - You can verify that the RDS instance is now using the Customer-Managed Key by describing the RDS instance and checking the `KmsKeyId` attribute. Here is an example code snippet to describe the RDS instance:

   ```python
   response = rds_client.describe_db_instances(
       DBInstanceIdentifier='your-rds-instance-id',
   )

   kms_key_id = response['DBInstances'][0]['KmsKeyId']
   print(f"KMS Key ID used by RDS instance: {kms_key_id}")
   ```

By following these steps and running the Python code, you can remediate the misconfiguration by using a Customer-Managed Key instead of AWS-managed Keys for your AWS RDS instance.
