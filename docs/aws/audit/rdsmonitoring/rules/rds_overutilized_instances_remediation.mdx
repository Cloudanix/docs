### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Databases".

3. Select the RDS instance that you want to check for overutilization.

4. In the instance details section, click on the "Monitoring" tab.

5. Here, you can see various metrics related to the instance's performance. Check the CPU utilization, Memory usage, and Disk I/O operations. If these metrics are consistently high, it indicates that the RDS instance is overutilized. 

6. You can also set up CloudWatch alarms for these metrics to get notified when the utilization exceeds a certain threshold. 

7. Additionally, check the "Performance Insights" dashboard for the RDS instance. This provides a more detailed view of the database load and can help identify SQL queries that are consuming excessive resources.

8. Lastly, check the "Events & subscription" tab for any events related to high utilization or performance issues.

#### Using CLI

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you can start, make sure you have AWS CLI installed and configured on your system. You can install it using pip (Python package installer). The command is `pip install awscli`. After installation, you can configure it using `aws configure` command. You will be asked to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. **List all RDS Instances**: Use the AWS CLI command `aws rds describe-db-instances` to list all the RDS instances. This command will return a JSON output with all the details of your RDS instances.

3. **Check CPU Utilization**: For each RDS instance, you can check the CPU utilization using the AWS CloudWatch. Use the following AWS CLI command to get the CPU utilization metric: 
```
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/RDS --metric-name CPUUtilization --dimensions Name=DBInstanceIdentifier,Value=your_db_instance_identifier --start-time 2021-01-01T00:00:00Z --end-time 2021-01-02T00:00:00Z --period 3600 --statistics Maximum
```
Replace `your_db_instance_identifier` with your actual DB instance identifier. Adjust the `--start-time` and `--end-time` parameters as per your requirement. This command will return the maximum CPU utilization for the specified period.

4. **Analyze the Output**: The output of the above command will give you the maximum CPU utilization for each RDS instance. If the CPU utilization is consistently high (over 80-90%), it indicates that the RDS instance is overutilized. You might need to upgrade your instance or optimize your queries to reduce the CPU utilization.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   To interact with AWS services, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials to allow Boto3 to interact with AWS services. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_key'
   AWS_SESSION_TOKEN='your_session_token'
   ```

2. Import necessary libraries and establish a session:
   You need to import Boto3 and establish a session with the region where your RDS instances are located.
   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       region_name='your_region_name'
   )
   ```

3. Connect to the RDS service and retrieve all RDS instances:
   Use the session to connect to the RDS service and retrieve all RDS instances.
   ```python
   rds = session.client('rds')
   response = rds.describe_db_instances()
   ```

4. Check the CPU utilization of each RDS instance:
   For each RDS instance, you can use the CloudWatch `get_metric_statistics` method to retrieve the CPU utilization. If the CPU utilization is consistently high, the RDS instance may be overutilized.
   ```python
   cloudwatch = session.client('cloudwatch')

   for instance in response['DBInstances']:
       stats = cloudwatch.get_metric_statistics(
           Namespace='AWS/RDS',
           MetricName='CPUUtilization',
           Dimensions=[
               {
                   'Name': 'DBInstanceIdentifier',
                   'Value': instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']
               },
           ],
           StartTime=datetime.datetime.utcnow() - datetime.timedelta(seconds=600),
           EndTime=datetime.datetime.utcnow(),
           Period=60,
           Statistics=['Average']
       )
       if stats['Datapoints']:
           avg_cpu_utilization = stats['Datapoints'][0]['Average']
           if avg_cpu_utilization > 80:  # adjust the threshold as needed
               print(f"RDS instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} is overutilized with average CPU utilization of {avg_cpu_utilization}%")
   ```
   This script will print out the identifiers of all RDS instances that have an average CPU utilization of over 80% in the last 10 minutes. Adjust the threshold and the time period as needed.

   Here is an example Python code snippet to get you started:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       rds = boto3.client('rds')
       db_instances = rds.describe_db_instances()

       for db_instance in db_instances['DBInstances']:
           db_instance_identifier = db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']
           cpu_utilization = get_cpu_utilization(db_instance_identifier)
           
           if cpu_utilization > 80:  # Adjust the threshold as needed
               modify_instance_size(db_instance_identifier)

   def get_cpu_utilization(db_instance_identifier):
       # Implement logic to get CPU utilization of the RDS instance
       # You can use CloudWatch metrics for this purpose
       pass

   def modify_instance_size(db_instance_identifier):
       # Implement logic to modify the instance size of the RDS instance
       # You can use the modify_db_instance API of the RDS client
       pass
   ```

4. **CloudWatch Metrics**:
   - Set up CloudWatch Alarms to monitor the CPU utilization of RDS instances.
   - Create a custom metric filter to track the CPU utilization.

5. **Testing**:
   - Test the Lambda function by invoking it manually or setting up a CloudWatch Event trigger.
   - Monitor the logs and CloudWatch metrics to ensure the function is working as expected.

By following these steps, you can automate the remediation of overutilized RDS instances in AWS using Python and Lambda functions.
