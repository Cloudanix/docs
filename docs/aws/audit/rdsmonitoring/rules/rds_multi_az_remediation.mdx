### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not using Multi-AZ Deployment for an AWS RDS instance, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/) and log in to your account.

2. **Navigate to RDS Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top left corner and select "RDS" under the Database category.

3. **Select the RDS Instance**: From the list of RDS instances, select the instance for which you want to enable Multi-AZ Deployment by clicking on its identifier.

4. **Enable Multi-AZ Deployment**: In the RDS instance details page, click on the "Instance actions" dropdown menu and select "Modify".

5. **Modify the Deployment Options**: Scroll down to the "Deployment options" section and check the box next to "Enable Multi-AZ deployment".

6. **Review and Apply Changes**: Review the other configuration settings to ensure they are correct. Click on the "Continue" button.

7. **Apply Changes**: On the next page, review the summary of changes and click on the "Modify DB Instance" button to apply the changes.

8. **Monitor the Modification**: The modification process will start, and you can monitor the progress on the RDS console. Once the modification is complete, the Multi-AZ Deployment will be enabled for your RDS instance.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of not using Multi-AZ Deployment for your AWS RDS instance.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of not using Multi-AZ deployment for an AWS RDS instance using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to modify your RDS instance to enable Multi-AZ deployment:
   
   ```
   aws rds modify-db-instance \
   --db-instance-identifier YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER \
   --multi-az \
   --apply-immediately
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER` with the actual identifier of your RDS instance.

3. Wait for the modification to complete. You can check the status of the modification by running the following command:
   
   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,DBInstanceStatus]'
   ```

4. Once the modification is complete and the status shows as "available", the Multi-AZ deployment for your RDS instance has been successfully enabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not using Multi-AZ deployment for an AWS RDS instance using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of not using Multi-AZ deployment for an AWS RDS instance using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Define the AWS region and the RDS instance identifier:
```python
region = 'your_aws_region'
instance_identifier = 'your_rds_instance_identifier'
```

3. Create an RDS client using Boto3:
```python
rds_client = boto3.client('rds', region_name=region)
```

4. Modify the RDS instance to enable Multi-AZ deployment:
```python
response = rds_client.modify_db_instance(
    DBInstanceIdentifier=instance_identifier,
    MultiAZ=True
)
```

5. Check the response to ensure the modification was successful:
```python
if response['DBInstance']['MultiAZ']:
    print(f"Multi-AZ deployment enabled for RDS instance {instance_identifier}")
else:
    print(f"Failed to enable Multi-AZ deployment for RDS instance {instance_identifier}")
```

6. Run the Python script to enable Multi-AZ deployment for the specified RDS instance.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not using Multi-AZ deployment for an AWS RDS instance using Python.
