### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not using Multi-AZ Deployment in AWS, follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the Amazon RDS dashboard.
3. Select the RDS instance that needs to be updated with Multi-AZ deployment.
4. Click on the Modify button.
5. In the Modify DB instance page, scroll down to the Availability section.
6. Select the checkbox for Multi-AZ deployment.
7. Click on the Continue button.
8. Review the changes and click on the Modify DB instance button.

Once the above steps are completed, the RDS instance will be updated with Multi-AZ deployment. This will ensure that the RDS instance is highly available and can withstand a failure of the primary availability zone.

#### Using CLI

Multi-AZ deployment is a best practice in AWS to ensure high availability and fault tolerance for your applications. Here are the steps to remediate this misconfiguration using AWS CLI:

1. Open your terminal and ensure that AWS CLI is installed and configured with valid credentials.

2. Run the following command to create a new RDS instance with Multi-AZ deployment enabled:

```
aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER> --engine <DB_ENGINE> --db-instance-class <DB_INSTANCE_CLASS> --master-username <MASTER_USERNAME> --master-user-password <MASTER_PASSWORD> --multi-az --allocated-storage <STORAGE_SIZE>
```

Replace the placeholders with your own values. This command will create a new RDS instance with Multi-AZ deployment enabled.

3. Wait for the RDS instance to be created and Multi-AZ deployment to be enabled. You can check the status of your RDS instance using the following command:

```
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER>
```

Replace the placeholder with your own value. This command will describe the details of your RDS instance.

4. Once Multi-AZ deployment is enabled, you can test the failover by stopping the primary instance. You can do this using the following command:

```
aws rds stop-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER>
```

Replace the placeholder with your own value. This command will stop the primary instance and initiate a failover to the standby instance.

5. Verify that the failover was successful by checking the status of your RDS instance using the following command:

```
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER>
```

Replace the placeholder with your own value. This command will describe the details of your RDS instance and show that the failover was successful.

That's it! Your RDS instance is now configured with Multi-AZ deployment enabled.

#### Using Python

Multi-AZ deployment is a recommended best practice in AWS to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. To remediate this misconfiguration, you can use the following steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the RDS dashboard.
2. Select the RDS instance that needs to be remediated.
3. Click on the "Modify" button to modify the instance settings.
4. Scroll down to the "Availability & durability" section.
5. Select "Yes" for the "Multi-AZ deployment" option.
6. Click on the "Continue" button.
7. Review the changes and click on the "Modify DB instance" button to apply the changes.

To automate this process using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) as follows:

```
import boto3

# Create an RDS client
rds = boto3.client('rds')

# Set the DB instance identifier
db_instance_identifier = 'mydbinstance'

# Modify the DB instance to enable Multi-AZ deployment
response = rds.modify_db_instance(
    DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance_identifier,
    MultiAZ=True
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

Note: Before running the above code, you need to configure your AWS credentials and region using the `aws configure` command or by setting the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`.
