### Remediation

How to ensure that your AWS RDS database snapshots are not publicly accessible?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon RDS service by searching for "RDS" in the AWS services search bar and selecting "RDS" from the results.
3. In the RDS dashboard, click on "Snapshots" in the left sidebar.
4. Locate the snapshot(s) that are marked as public or that you want to secure.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "RDS Database Snapshots Should Not Be Public" Policy.)
5. Select the checkbox next to the snapshot(s) you want to modify.
6. At the top of the snapshots list, click on the "Modify Snapshot Permissions" button.
7. In the "Modify Snapshot Permissions" dialog box, uncheck the box next to "Publicly Accessible."
8. Click on the "Save Changes" button to apply the modifications.
9. The public access to the selected snapshot(s) will be revoked, and they will no longer be publicly accessible.
10. Repeat steps 5-9 for any other public snapshots that you need to secure.
