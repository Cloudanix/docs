1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Snapshots". This will open a list of all the snapshots available in your AWS account.

3. Select the snapshot that you want to check. In the "Snapshot Details" section, look for the "Public" attribute. If the attribute value is set to "Yes", then the selected RDS snapshot is publicly accessible.

4. Repeat the process for each snapshot in your account. If you have many snapshots, you can use the search functionality to filter the snapshots based on their public accessibility status.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all RDS snapshots: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the RDS snapshots in your account:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-snapshots
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the RDS snapshots.

3. Check the 'PubliclyAccessible' attribute: In the JSON output, look for the 'PubliclyAccessible' attribute for each snapshot. If the value of this attribute is 'true', then the snapshot is publicly accessible.

   You can use the following command to filter out the snapshots that are publicly accessible:
   ```
   aws rds describe-db-snapshots --query 'DBSnapshots[?PubliclyAccessible==`true`]'
   ```
4. Review the output: If the above command returns any snapshots, it means those snapshots are publicly accessible and it's a misconfiguration. If it doesn't return any snapshot, it means none of your RDS snapshots are publicly accessible.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your local environment. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access RDS services.

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials.

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Create a client for 'rds' service and retrieve all DB snapshots.

```python
rds = session.client('rds')
snapshots = rds.describe_db_snapshots()
```

4. Iterate over the snapshots and check the 'PubliclyAccessible' attribute. If it's set to 'True', then the snapshot is public.

```python
for snapshot in snapshots['DBSnapshots']:
    if snapshot['PubliclyAccessible']:
        print(f"Snapshot {snapshot['DBSnapshotIdentifier']} is public.")
```

This script will print out the identifiers of all public RDS snapshots. If no output is produced, then there are no public RDS snapshots.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the issue of RDS Database Snapshots being public in AWS, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to the RDS Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page, then select "RDS" under the Database category.

3. **Select the RDS Instance**: In the RDS dashboard, locate and click on the RDS instance for which you want to secure the snapshots.

4. **Access the Snapshots**: In the RDS instance details page, find the "Snapshots" section in the left-hand menu and click on it.

5. **Identify Public Snapshots**: Look through the list of snapshots to identify any that are marked as public.

6. **Modify Snapshot Permissions**:
   - Click on the checkbox next to the public snapshot(s) that you want to secure.
   - Click on the "Modify Snapshot Permissions" button in the top menu.
   - In the "Modify Snapshot Permissions" window, uncheck the option that allows public access.
   - Click on the "Save Changes" button to apply the new permissions.

7. **Verify Changes**:
   - Review the list of snapshots again to ensure that the public snapshots are no longer accessible to the public.

8. **Repeat if Necessary**: If you have multiple RDS instances with public snapshots, repeat the above steps for each instance to secure all the snapshots.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the issue of RDS Database Snapshots being public in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the issue of RDS Database Snapshots being public in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. List all the RDS database snapshots that are currently public:
```bash
aws rds describe-db-snapshot-attributes --db-snapshot-identifier <your-db-snapshot-identifier> --query "DBSnapshotAttributesResult.DBSnapshotAttributes[?AttributeName=='restore'].AttributeName" --output text
```

2. Modify the DB snapshot attribute to make it private:
```bash
aws rds modify-db-snapshot-attribute --db-snapshot-identifier <your-db-snapshot-identifier> --attribute-name restore --values-to-add all
```

3. Verify that the DB snapshot attribute has been updated successfully:
```bash
aws rds describe-db-snapshot-attributes --db-snapshot-identifier <your-db-snapshot-identifier> --query "DBSnapshotAttributesResult.DBSnapshotAttributes[?AttributeName=='restore'].AttributeName" --output text
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of RDS Database Snapshots being public in AWS RDS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of having RDS database snapshots public in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Public Snapshots**:
   - Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all the RDS database snapshots.
   - Filter out the snapshots that are marked as public.

2. **Update Snapshot Permissions**:
   - For each public snapshot identified, modify the snapshot attribute to make it private.
   - Use the `modify_db_snapshot_attribute` method from the Boto3 RDS client to update the snapshot attribute.

3. **Sample Python Script**:
   Here is a sample Python script that demonstrates how to identify and update public RDS database snapshots to private:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize the RDS client
   rds_client = boto3.client('rds')

   # List all RDS snapshots
   response = rds_client.describe_db_snapshots()

   # Iterate through each snapshot
   for snapshot in response['DBSnapshots']:
       if snapshot['PubliclyAccessible']:
           # Update the snapshot attribute to make it private
           rds_client.modify_db_snapshot_attribute(
               DBSnapshotIdentifier=snapshot['DBSnapshotIdentifier'],
               AttributeName='restore',
               ValuesToRemove=['all'],
           )
           print(f"Snapshot {snapshot['DBSnapshotIdentifier']} is now private.")
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   - Save the script in a file (e.g., `remediate_public_snapshots.py`) and run it using Python.
   - Make sure you have the necessary IAM permissions to modify RDS snapshot attributes.

By following these steps and running the Python script, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having public RDS database snapshots in AWS.
