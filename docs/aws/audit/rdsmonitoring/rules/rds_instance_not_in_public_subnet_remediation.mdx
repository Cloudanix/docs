### Remediation

How to Ensure that no AWS RDS DB instances are provisioned inside VPC public subnets?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the left navigation panel, under RDS Dashboard, click Databases and select the RDS instance that you want to migrate to private subnet(s).

- Step 2: From the Actions drop-down, from the dashboard top menu, select Take Snapshot to create a database snapshot (backup).

- Step 3: On the DB Snapshot page, in the Name box, enter a unique name for the database backup then click Take Snapshot to send the request.

- Step 4: Go back to the Databases page and select again the RDS instance that you want to migrate.

- Step 5: Click Modify button from the dashboard menu. On the Modify DB Instance: instance identifier page, perform the following actions:
  A: Select the appropriate DB Subnet Group (i.e. the one that contains only private subnets, usually created in another VPC) from the Subnet Group dropdown list.
  B: At the bottom of the page select Apply Immediately checkbox to apply the subnet group change immediately. (!) IMPORTANT: when you move the instance to another DB Subnet Group an immediate outage will occur. If the selected database instance is used in production consider leaving Apply Immediately option disabled before applying the changes in order to avoid any downtime. If Apply Immediately is not selected, the database subnet group change will be processed during the next maintenance window.

- Step 6: Click the Continue button, Review the changes and click Modify DB Instance. During the modification process the instance status should change from available to modifying and back to available (it may take few minutes depending on the instance size and configuration).
