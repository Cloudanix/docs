### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the RDS dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu and then selecting "RDS" under the "Database" category.
3. In the navigation pane, click on "Databases".
4. Select the RDS instance that you want to check.
5. In the details pane, click on the "Configuration" tab.
6. Scroll down to the "Event subscriptions" section. If no event subscription is listed, then Event Notification Subscriptions are not enabled for this RDS instance.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all your RDS instances using the following command:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier]' --output text
   ```

   This command will return a list of all DBInstanceIdentifiers (RDS instance IDs).

3. For each RDS instance, you can check the event subscription status using the following command:

   ```
   aws rds describe-event-subscriptions --subscription-name <DBInstanceIdentifier>
   ```

   Replace `<DBInstanceIdentifier>` with the ID of your RDS instance. This command will return the details of the event subscription for the specified RDS instance.

4. In the output of the above command, look for the "Enabled" field. If the value of this field is "true", then the event notification subscription is enabled for the RDS instance. If the value is "false", then the event notification subscription is not enabled.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating the credentials file yourself. By default, its location is at `~/.aws/credentials`. At a minimum, the credentials file should look like this:

   ```bash
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Write the Python script: Now you can write a Python script to check if Event Notification Subscriptions are enabled in RDS. Here is a simple script that lists all RDS instances and checks if they have Event Notification Subscriptions enabled:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_event_notification_subscriptions():
       client = boto3.client('rds')
       response = client.describe_event_subscriptions()
       for subscription in response['EventSubscriptionsList']:
           if subscription['Status'] != 'active':
               print(f"Event Notification Subscription {subscription['CustSubscriptionId']} is not active")

   check_event_notification_subscriptions()
   ```

4. Run the Python script: Finally, you can run the Python script. If there are any RDS instances with Event Notification Subscriptions not enabled, they will be printed out. If no output is produced, it means that all RDS instances have Event Notification Subscriptions enabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Event Notification Subscriptions not being enabled for an AWS RDS instance using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and login using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to RDS Service**: From the AWS Management Console, navigate to the RDS service by clicking on "Services" in the top left corner, then selecting "RDS" under the Database category.

3. **Select the RDS Instance**: In the RDS dashboard, select the RDS instance for which you want to enable Event Notification Subscriptions by clicking on the checkbox next to the instance.

4. **Enable Event Notification Subscriptions**: With the RDS instance selected, click on the "Modify" button from the top menu to modify the instance settings.

5. **Scroll down to Event Subscriptions**: In the Modify DB Instance window, scroll down to the "Event Subscriptions" section.

6. **Add Event Subscription**: Click on the "Add Event Subscription" button to create a new event subscription for the RDS instance.

7. **Configure Event Subscription**: Configure the event subscription by selecting the events you want to be notified about, the SNS topic to which the notifications should be sent, and any other relevant settings.

8. **Save Changes**: Once you have configured the event subscription, click on the "Add Event Subscription" button to save the changes.

9. **Verify Configuration**: After saving the changes, verify that the Event Notification Subscription has been successfully enabled for the RDS instance by checking the Event Subscriptions section in the RDS dashboard.

By following these steps, you will successfully remediate the misconfiguration of Event Notification Subscriptions not being enabled for an AWS RDS instance using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Event Notification Subscriptions not being enabled for AWS RDS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **List current event subscriptions**: First, you need to list the current event subscriptions for your RDS instance to check if there are any existing subscriptions. You can use the following AWS CLI command:
   
   ```bash
   aws rds describe-event-subscriptions
   ```

2. **Enable Event Notification Subscription**: If there are no existing event subscriptions or the required subscriptions are not enabled, you can create a new event subscription using the following AWS CLI command:

   ```bash
   aws rds create-event-subscription --subscription-name <subscription-name> --sns-topic-arn <sns-topic-arn> --source-type db-instance --source-ids <rds-instance-identifier> --event-categories <event-categories>
   ```

   - Replace `<subscription-name>` with a name for your event subscription.
   - Replace `<sns-topic-arn>` with the ARN of the SNS topic to which you want to send the notifications.
   - Replace `<rds-instance-identifier>` with the identifier of your RDS instance.
   - Replace `<event-categories>` with the specific event categories you want to subscribe to (e.g., `availability`, `backup`, `failure`, `notification`, etc.).

3. **Verify Event Subscription**: After creating the event subscription, you can verify if it has been successfully created by listing the event subscriptions again using the `describe-event-subscriptions` command.

By following the above steps and enabling Event Notification Subscriptions for your AWS RDS instance using the AWS CLI, you can remediate the misconfiguration and ensure that you receive important notifications about events occurring in your RDS environment.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Event Notification Subscriptions not being enabled for an AWS RDS instance using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to enable the event subscriptions. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this issue:

1. Install Boto3: If you haven't already installed the Boto3 library, you can do so using pip:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Make sure you have configured your AWS credentials either by setting environment variables or using the AWS CLI `aws configure` command.

3. Write a Python script to enable Event Notification Subscriptions for the RDS instance. Here is an example script:

```python
import boto3

def enable_event_subscription(rds_instance_identifier, sns_topic_arn):
    client = boto3.client('rds')
    
    response = client.create_event_subscription(
        SubscriptionName='my-rds-event-subscription',
        SnsTopicArn=sns_topic_arn,
        SourceType='db-instance',
        SourceIds=[rds_instance_identifier],
        EventCategories=[
            'availability',
            'backup',
            'configuration change',
            'creation',
            'deletion',
            'failover',
            'failure',
            'maintenance',
            'notification',
            'recovery',
            'restoration'
        ]
    )

    print(response)

# Replace 'my-rds-instance' with your RDS instance identifier
rds_instance_identifier = 'my-rds-instance'

# Replace 'my-sns-topic-arn' with the ARN of your SNS topic
sns_topic_arn = 'my-sns-topic-arn'

enable_event_subscription(rds_instance_identifier, sns_topic_arn)
```

4. Replace `'my-rds-instance'` with the identifier of your RDS instance and `'my-sns-topic-arn'` with the ARN of the SNS topic to which you want to subscribe for RDS events.

5. Run the Python script. This will create an event subscription for the specified RDS instance that sends notifications to the specified SNS topic for the specified event categories.

By following these steps and running the Python script, you can successfully enable Event Notification Subscriptions for an AWS RDS instance using Python.
