### More Info:

RDS database instances provisioned in your AWS account should not be publicly accessible and should instead restrict unauthorized access in order to minimise security risks.

### Risk Level

High

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

HIPAA, PCIDSS, NIST, SOC2, HITRUST, AWSWAF, GDPR, NISTCSF, FedRAMP

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Databases".

3. Choose the name of the RDS instance that you want to check.

4. In the "Connectivity & security" tab, under "Security" section, look for "Public accessibility". If the value is "Yes", then the RDS instance is publicly accessible.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can run any AWS CLI commands, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```

   During the configuration process, you will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all RDS instances: Use the `describe-db-instances` command to list all your RDS instances. This command returns a JSON object that contains all your RDS instances.

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances
   ```

3. Parse the output: The output of the previous command includes a lot of information. You are interested in the `DBInstances` array, which contains information about each RDS instance. More specifically, you are interested in the `PubliclyAccessible` attribute of each instance, which indicates whether the instance is publicly accessible or not.

   You can use the `jq` command-line JSON processor to parse the output and filter out the instances that are publicly accessible. Here is an example:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances | jq -r '.DBInstances[] | select(.PubliclyAccessible == true) | .DBInstanceIdentifier'
   ```

4. Review the results: The previous command returns the identifiers of all RDS instances that are publicly accessible. If the command doesn't return any identifiers, it means that none of your RDS instances are publicly accessible. If the command returns one or more identifiers, it means that those instances are publicly accessible and you should take action to secure them.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The primary library you need is boto3, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call any AWS services. You can pass these credentials directly in your python script (not recommended) or you can configure it once using the AWS CLI and then boto3 will automatically use those credentials. Here is how you can configure it:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   AWS Access Key ID [None]: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   Default region name [None]: YOUR_REGION_NAME
   Default output format [None]: json
   ```

3. Write the Python script: Now you can write a Python script that uses boto3 to check if any RDS instances are publicly accessible. Here is a simple script that does this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_rds_public_accessibility():
       rds = boto3.client('rds')
       instances = rds.describe_db_instances()
       for instance in instances['DBInstances']:
           if instance['PubliclyAccessible']:
               print(f"RDS instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} is publicly accessible")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_rds_public_accessibility()
   ```

   This script first creates a client for the RDS service. It then calls the describe_db_instances method to get a list of all RDS instances. It then iterates over each instance and checks if the 'PubliclyAccessible' attribute is True. If it is, it prints a message with the instance identifier.

4. Run the Python script: Finally, you can run the Python script using the Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python check_rds_public_accessibility.py
   ```

   This will print out the identifiers of any RDS instances that are publicly accessible. If no instances are publicly accessible, it will not print anything.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the issue of RDS instances being publicly accessible in AWS, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to RDS Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page, select "RDS" under the Database category.

3. **Select the RDS Instance**: From the list of RDS instances, select the instance that you want to modify to make it not publicly accessible.

4. **Modify the Security Group**: In the details page of the selected RDS instance, scroll down to the "Security" section and click on the link for the associated Security Group.

5. **Edit Inbound Rules**: In the Security Group page, click on the "Inbound rules" tab and locate the rule that allows inbound traffic from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) on the database port (usually 3306 for MySQL, 5432 for PostgreSQL, etc.).

6. **Remove the Public Access Rule**: Select the rule that allows public access (0.0.0.0/0) and click on the "Actions" dropdown menu. Then, click on "Delete rule".

7. **Add a Rule for Specific IP**: If you still need to access the RDS instance from specific IP addresses, you can add a new inbound rule that allows traffic only from those IP addresses. Click on the "Add rule" button, select the type of rule (e.g., MySQL/Aurora, PostgreSQL), and specify the IP range or specific IPs that should be allowed to access the RDS instance.

8. **Review and Apply Changes**: Review the changes you have made to the Security Group and ensure that only necessary IP addresses have access to the RDS instance. Once you are satisfied, click on the "Save rules" button to apply the changes.

9. **Verify Public Accessibility**: Finally, go back to the RDS instance details page and verify that the instance is no longer publicly accessible by checking the "Publicly Accessible" attribute. It should be set to "No".

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the issue of RDS instances being publicly accessible in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of having publicly accessible RDS instances in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. List all the RDS instances that are publicly accessible:
```bash
aws rds describe-db-instances --query "DBInstances[?PubliclyAccessible=='true'].DBInstanceIdentifier" --output text
```

2. For each publicly accessible RDS instance, modify the instance to make it not publicly accessible:
```bash
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER --no-publicly-accessible
```
Replace `YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER` with the actual identifier of the RDS instance.

3. Verify that the RDS instance is no longer publicly accessible:
```bash
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER --query "DBInstances[0].PubliclyAccessible"
```
Replace `YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER` with the actual identifier of the RDS instance.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having publicly accessible RDS instances in AWS using the AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of having publicly accessible RDS instances in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the `boto3` library if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Use the following Python script to update the RDS instance to make it not publicly accessible. Replace `YOUR_RDS_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER` with the identifier of your RDS instance:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the RDS client
client = boto3.client('rds')

# Update the RDS instance to make it not publicly accessible
response = client.modify_db_instance(
    DBInstanceIdentifier='YOUR_RDS_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER',
    PubliclyAccessible=False
)

print("RDS instance updated successfully. It is no longer publicly accessible.")
```

3. Run the Python script to update the RDS instance and make it not publicly accessible.

After running this script, your RDS instance will no longer be publicly accessible, thus remediating the misconfiguration.
