### More Info:

RDS database instances provisioned in your AWS account should not be publicly accessible and should instead restrict unauthorized access in order to minimise security risks.

### Risk Level

High

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

HIPAA, PCIDSS, NIST, SOC2, HITRUST, AWSWAF, GDPR, NISTCSF, FedRAMP

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the RDS Instances Should Not Be Publicly Accessible misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to your AWS console and navigate to the RDS dashboard.
2. Select the RDS instance that you want to remediate.
3. Click on the "Modify" button in the top right corner of the dashboard.
4. Scroll down to the "Network and Security" section.
5. Under the "Security Group" option, select the security group that is associated with the RDS instance.
6. In the "Inbound Rules" section, click on the "Edit" button.
7. Remove the rule that allows traffic from "Anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0) to the RDS instance.
8. Add a new rule that allows traffic only from specific IP addresses or CIDR blocks that need access to the RDS instance.
9. Click on the "Save Changes" button to apply the changes.
10. Wait for a few minutes for the changes to take effect.

Once the above steps are completed, the RDS instance will no longer be publicly accessible and can only be accessed by the specified IP addresses or CIDR blocks.

#### Using CLI

To remediate RDS Instances being publicly accessible in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and install AWS CLI if it is not already installed. You can follow the instructions given on the official AWS documentation to install AWS CLI.

2. Once you have installed AWS CLI, run the following command to list all the RDS instances in your AWS account:

```
aws rds describe-db-instances
```

3. Look for the RDS instances that are publicly accessible. You can identify them by checking the value of the PubliclyAccessible parameter. If the value is true, it means that the instance is publicly accessible.

4. To remediate this issue, you need to modify the instance and set the PubliclyAccessible parameter to false. Run the following command to modify the instance:

```
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <instance_name> --no-publicly-accessible
```

Replace `<instance_name>` with the name of the RDS instance that you want to modify.

5. After running the above command, AWS will modify the RDS instance and set the PubliclyAccessible parameter to false. You can verify this by running the describe-db-instances command again.

6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all the RDS instances that are publicly accessible.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the issue of RDS instances being publicly accessible in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Instances Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Identify all the RDS instances that are publicly accessible. You can use the `boto3` library in Python to achieve this. Here's a sample code snippet:

```
import boto3

rds_client = boto3.client('rds')

response = rds_client.describe_db_instances()

for db_instance in response['DBInstances']:
    if db_instance['PubliclyAccessible']:
        print("Publicly accessible RDS instance found: ", db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'])
```

2. Once you have identified the RDS instances that are publicly accessible, you can update their security group rules to remove the public access. Here's a sample code snippet to achieve this:

```
import boto3

rds_client = boto3.client('rds')

response = rds_client.describe_db_instances()

for db_instance in response['DBInstances']:
    if db_instance['PubliclyAccessible']:
        print("Updating security group rules for RDS instance: ", db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'])
        rds_client.modify_db_instance(
            DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'],
            PubliclyAccessible=False
        )
```

This code snippet will modify the RDS instance to make it not publicly accessible. Note that this will only update the RDS instance's security group rules, and you may also need to update any other resources that may have been granting public access to the RDS instance.
