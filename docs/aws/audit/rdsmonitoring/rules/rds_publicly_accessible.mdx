### More Info:

RDS database instances provisioned in your AWS account should not be publicly accessible and should instead restrict unauthorized access in order to minimise security risks.

### Risk Level

High

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Databases".

3. In the list of DB instances, choose the name of the DB instance that you want to check.

4. In the "Connectivity & security" tab, under "Security" section, check the "Public accessibility" field. If it is set to "Yes", then the RDS instance is publicly accessible.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can run any AWS CLI commands, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local system. You can do this by following the instructions provided in the AWS CLI User Guide.

2. List all RDS instances: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the RDS instances in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with the details of all your RDS instances.

3. Check the 'PubliclyAccessible' attribute: In the JSON output, look for the 'PubliclyAccessible' attribute for each RDS instance. If the value of this attribute is 'true', then the RDS instance is publicly accessible. 

   You can use the following command to filter out the instances that are publicly accessible:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,PubliclyAccessible]' --output text
   ```

4. Analyze the output: The above command will return a list of all RDS instances along with their 'PubliclyAccessible' status. Review this list to identify any RDS instances that are publicly accessible. 

   Note: If you have many RDS instances, you may want to write a script to automate this process. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to write a script that iterates over all your RDS instances and checks their 'PubliclyAccessible' status.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The primary library you need is boto3, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. You can configure it in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

3. Write the Python script: Now you can write a Python script that uses boto3 to check if any RDS instances are publicly accessible. Here's a simple script that does this:

```python
import boto3

def check_public_accessibility():
    client = boto3.client('rds')
    response = client.describe_db_instances()
    for instance in response['DBInstances']:
        if instance['PubliclyAccessible']:
            print(f"RDS instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} is publicly accessible")

check_public_accessibility()
```

This script first creates a client for the RDS service. It then calls the describe_db_instances method to get a list of all DB instances. For each instance, it checks if the 'PubliclyAccessible' attribute is True. If it is, it prints a message indicating that the instance is publicly accessible.

4. Run the Python script: Finally, you can run the Python script using the Python interpreter:

```bash
python check_rds_public_accessibility.py
```

This will print a message for each RDS instance that is publicly accessible. If no messages are printed, then no RDS instances are publicly accessible.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of RDS instances being publicly accessible in AWS, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to RDS Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page, select "RDS" under the Database category.

3. **Select the RDS Instance**: From the list of RDS instances, select the instance that you want to modify to make it not publicly accessible.

4. **Modify the Security Group**: In the details page of the selected RDS instance, scroll down to the "Security" section and click on the link for the associated Security Group.

5. **Edit Inbound Rules**: In the Security Group page, click on the "Inbound rules" tab and locate the rule that allows inbound traffic from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) on the database port (usually 3306 for MySQL, 5432 for PostgreSQL, etc.).

6. **Remove the Public Access Rule**: Select the rule that allows public access (0.0.0.0/0) and click on the "Actions" dropdown menu. Then, click on "Delete rule".

7. **Add a Rule for Specific IP**: If you still need to access the RDS instance from specific IP addresses, you can add a new inbound rule that allows traffic only from those IP addresses. Click on the "Add rule" button, select the type of rule (e.g., MySQL/Aurora, PostgreSQL), and specify the IP range or specific IPs that should be allowed to access the RDS instance.

8. **Review and Apply Changes**: Review the changes you have made to the Security Group and ensure that only necessary IP addresses have access to the RDS instance. Once you are satisfied, click on the "Save rules" button to apply the changes.

9. **Verify Public Accessibility**: Finally, go back to the RDS instance details page and verify that the instance is no longer publicly accessible by checking the "Publicly Accessible" attribute. It should be set to "No".

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the issue of RDS instances being publicly accessible in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of having publicly accessible RDS instances in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. List all the RDS instances that are publicly accessible:
```bash
aws rds describe-db-instances --query "DBInstances[?PubliclyAccessible=='true'].DBInstanceIdentifier" --output text
```

2. For each publicly accessible RDS instance, modify the instance to make it not publicly accessible:
```bash
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER --no-publicly-accessible
```
Replace `YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER` with the actual identifier of the RDS instance.

3. Verify that the RDS instance is no longer publicly accessible:
```bash
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER --query "DBInstances[0].PubliclyAccessible"
```
Replace `YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER` with the actual identifier of the RDS instance.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having publicly accessible RDS instances in AWS using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of having publicly accessible RDS instances in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the `boto3` library if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Use the following Python script to update the RDS instance to make it not publicly accessible. Replace `YOUR_RDS_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER` with the identifier of your RDS instance:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the RDS client
client = boto3.client('rds')

# Update the RDS instance to make it not publicly accessible
response = client.modify_db_instance(
    DBInstanceIdentifier='YOUR_RDS_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER',
    PubliclyAccessible=False
)

print("RDS instance updated successfully. It is no longer publicly accessible.")
```

3. Run the Python script to update the RDS instance and make it not publicly accessible.

After running this script, your RDS instance will no longer be publicly accessible, thus remediating the misconfiguration.
