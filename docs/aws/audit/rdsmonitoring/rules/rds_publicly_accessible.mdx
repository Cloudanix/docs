#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Amazon RDS service by selecting "RDS" from the services menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "RDS Instances Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" Policy.)
3. In the RDS dashboard, click on "Databases" in the left navigation pane.
4. Locate the RDS database instance(s) that are publicly accessible.
5. Click on the checkbox next to the database instance(s) you want to remediate.
6. Above the list of database instances, click on the "Actions" button.
7. In the dropdown menu, select "Modify".
8. In the "Modify DB Instance" page, scroll down to the "Connectivity" section.
9. In the "Connectivity" section, locate the "Publicly accessible" option.
10. Set the value of "Publicly accessible" to "No" to disable public access.
11. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Modify DB Instance" button to save the changes.

14. After the modification is complete, verify that the "Publicly accessible" setting is set to "No" for the database instances.
