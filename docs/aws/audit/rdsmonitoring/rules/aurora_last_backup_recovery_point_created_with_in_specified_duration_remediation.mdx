### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the steps to remediate this issue:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose 'Databases'.

3. Choose the name of the Aurora DB cluster that you want to modify.

4. Choose 'Modify'.

5. In the 'Backup' section, for 'Backup Retention Period', choose a value other than '0' days. The value you choose specifies how many recent automatic backups to retain. You can choose from '1' to '35' days.

6. Choose 'Continue'.

7. Review your changes on the summary page, then choose 'Modify DB Cluster' to save your changes.

8. Wait for the 'Status' of your DB cluster to show as 'Available' before you try to work with it.

Note: Modifying a DB cluster to enable automatic backups doesn't create an automatic backup immediately. Automatic backups are taken during the backup window of the DB cluster.

By setting a backup retention period, you ensure that you can restore your database to any point in time within the "retention period". This is crucial for data recovery in case of any accidental data deletion or corruption.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
In order to remediate this issue, you need to enable automated backups for your Amazon RDS DB instance. Automated backups are deleted when the DB instance is deleted. Here are the steps to remediate this issue:

1. First, you need to install AWS CLI on your system. You can download it from the official AWS website and install it based on your operating system.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and configure AWS CLI using the command `aws configure`. You will be asked to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format. Fill in the details accordingly.

3. Once AWS CLI is configured, you can use the following command to modify the RDS instance and set the backup retention period. Replace 'DBInstanceIdentifier' with the name of your DB instance, and 'BackupRetentionPeriod' with the number of days you want to retain your backup (for example, 7 days).

```
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier DBInstanceIdentifier --backup-retention-period BackupRetentionPeriod
```

4. Press Enter to execute the command. AWS RDS will then enable automated backups for the specified DB instance.

5. You can verify the backup policy by using the following command:

```
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier DBInstanceIdentifier
```

Look for the 'BackupRetentionPeriod' field in the output. It should reflect the number of days you set in step 3.

Note: You need to have necessary permissions to modify RDS instances and to create backups. If you don't have these permissions, you'll need to request them from your AWS administrator.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue you need to create a backup for the Aurora DB Cluster. Below are the steps to create a backup using python with the help of the boto3 library:

1. Install the boto3 library if you haven't already. You can do it using pip:
   
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and create a session using your AWS credentials:

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-1' # your region here
   )
   ```

3. Create an RDS client:

   ```python
   rds = session.client('rds')
   ```

4. Call the `create_db_cluster_snapshot` method to create a snapshot:

   ```python
   response = rds.create_db_cluster_snapshot(
       DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier='your_snapshot_name',
       DBClusterIdentifier='your_cluster_name'
   )
   ```

5. Check the status of the snapshot creation:

   ```python
   response = rds.describe_db_cluster_snapshots(
       DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier='your_snapshot_name',
   )

   status = response['DBClusterSnapshots'][0]['Status']
   print('Snapshot Status: ', status)
   ```

Remember to replace 'your_snapshot_name' and 'your_cluster_name' with your actual snapshot and DB cluster names.

This script will create a snapshot of your DB cluster. It's a good practice to create snapshots regularly to have recovery points.
