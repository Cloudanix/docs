### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the RDS dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu, then selecting "RDS" under the "Database" category.
3. In the navigation pane on the left, click on "Databases". This will display a list of all your RDS instances.
4. For each instance, check the "Engine version" column. If the version listed is deprecated, it means that the RDS instance is using a deprecated version.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all RDS instances: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the RDS instances in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,Engine,EngineVersion]'
   ```

   This command will return a list of all RDS instances along with their engine types and engine versions.

3. Check for deprecated versions: Now, you need to manually check the returned list for any deprecated RDS versions. AWS regularly updates the list of deprecated RDS versions on their official documentation. You need to compare the versions in your list with the versions in the AWS documentation to identify any deprecated versions.

4. Automate the process with a Python script: If you have a large number of RDS instances, it might be more efficient to automate the process with a Python script. You can use the `boto3` library to interact with AWS services. Here is a simple script that lists all RDS instances and their versions:

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('rds')

   response = client.describe_db_instances()

   for instance in response['DBInstances']:
       print(f"DBInstanceIdentifier: {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']}, Engine: {instance['Engine']}, EngineVersion: {instance['EngineVersion']}")
   ```

   You can modify this script to automatically check for deprecated versions by comparing the `EngineVersion` of each instance with a list of deprecated versions.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing your script, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3` in your terminal.

2. Import the necessary libraries and establish a session: In your Python script, you'll need to import the Boto3 library and establish a session with your AWS account. Here's how you can do that:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Connect to the RDS service: Once you've established a session, you can connect to the RDS service and retrieve a list of all DB instances. Here's how you can do that:

```python
rds = session.client('rds')

response = rds.describe_db_instances()

for instance in response['DBInstances']:
    print("DBInstanceIdentifier: ", instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'])
    print("Engine: ", instance['Engine'])
    print("EngineVersion: ", instance['EngineVersion'])
```

4. Check for deprecated versions: Now that you have a list of all DB instances, you can check each one to see if it's using a deprecated version. You'll need to refer to the AWS documentation to know which versions are deprecated. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```python
deprecated_versions = ['5.6.40', '5.7.22', '8.0.11']  # Replace with actual deprecated versions

for instance in response['DBInstances']:
    if instance['EngineVersion'] in deprecated_versions:
        print("DBInstanceIdentifier: ", instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'], " is using a deprecated version.")
```

This script will print out the identifiers of all DB instances that are using a deprecated version.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of using deprecated RDS versions in AWS, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Identify the RDS Instances with Deprecated Versions:**
   - Log in to your AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the RDS service.
   - Click on "Databases" from the left-hand menu.
   - Look for databases that are using deprecated RDS versions. These instances will be marked with a warning sign indicating that the version is deprecated.

2. **Create a Snapshot of the RDS Instance:**
   - Before performing any upgrade, it is recommended to create a snapshot of your RDS instance for backup purposes.
   - Select the RDS instance that you want to upgrade.
   - Click on the "Instance actions" dropdown menu.
   - Select "Take snapshot" and provide a name for the snapshot.

3. **Modify the RDS Instance:**
   - Select the RDS instance that you want to upgrade.
   - Click on the "Modify" button.
   - In the Modify RDS Instance window, select the desired RDS engine version that is supported and not deprecated.
   - Review the other configuration settings if needed.
   - Click on the "Continue" button.

4. **Apply the Changes:**
   - Review the changes you made in the Modify RDS Instance window.
   - Scroll down and click on the "Modify DB Instance" button to apply the changes.
   - AWS will schedule a maintenance window for the upgrade process. The actual upgrade will happen during this maintenance window.

5. **Monitor the Upgrade Process:**
   - Once the maintenance window starts, AWS will automatically upgrade the RDS instance to the new version.
   - Monitor the upgrade process from the RDS console to ensure that it completes successfully.

6. **Verify the Upgrade:**
   - After the upgrade process is completed, verify that the RDS instance is now running on the new, non-deprecated version.
   - Test your applications to ensure that they are working as expected with the upgraded RDS instance.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of using deprecated RDS versions in AWS and ensure that your RDS instances are running on supported and up-to-date versions.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of using deprecated RDS versions in AWS RDS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. List all the RDS instances and their engine versions currently in use:
```
aws rds describe-db-instances
```

2. Identify the RDS instances that are using deprecated engine versions. You can refer to the AWS RDS documentation to check for the latest supported engine versions.

3. Create a snapshot of the RDS instance that is using the deprecated engine version:
```
aws rds create-db-snapshot --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-name> --db-snapshot-identifier <snapshot-name>
```

4. Delete the RDS instance that is using the deprecated engine version:
```
aws rds delete-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-name> --skip-final-snapshot
```

5. Create a new RDS instance with the latest supported engine version using the snapshot created earlier:
```
aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot --db-instance-identifier <new-db-instance-name> --db-snapshot-identifier <snapshot-name> --db-instance-class <instance-type> --engine <engine-type>
```

6. Update any necessary configurations or settings on the new RDS instance as per your requirements.

7. Test the new RDS instance to ensure that it is functioning correctly with the latest supported engine version.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the issue of using deprecated RDS versions in AWS RDS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of using deprecated RDS versions in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the deprecated RDS versions in use**:
   - Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all the RDS instances in your account.
   - Check the engine version of each RDS instance against the list of deprecated versions provided by AWS.

2. **Upgrade the RDS instances**:
   - For each RDS instance using a deprecated version, create a snapshot of the instance.
   - Modify the RDS instance to upgrade to a supported version using the `modify_db_instance` method in Boto3.
   - Wait for the modification to be completed before proceeding to the next step.

3. **Test the upgraded RDS instances**:
   - Verify that the RDS instances are functioning correctly after the upgrade.
   - Check if any applications or services relying on these RDS instances are working as expected.

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Once you have confirmed that all RDS instances have been successfully upgraded, you can delete the snapshots created in step 2 to save costs and reduce clutter in your account.

Here is a sample Python script to help you get started:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the RDS client
rds_client = boto3.client('rds')

# List all RDS instances
response = rds_client.describe_db_instances()

# Deprecated RDS versions provided by AWS
deprecated_versions = ['your_deprecated_version_1', 'your_deprecated_version_2']

for db_instance in response['DBInstances']:
    # Check if the RDS instance is using a deprecated version
    if db_instance['EngineVersion'] in deprecated_versions:
        # Create a snapshot of the RDS instance
        snapshot_response = rds_client.create_db_snapshot(
            DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'],
            DBSnapshotIdentifier=f"{db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']}-snapshot"
        )
        
        # Modify the RDS instance to upgrade to a supported version
        rds_client.modify_db_instance(
            DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'],
            EngineVersion='your_supported_version'
        )
        
        print(f"Upgrading RDS instance {db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} to a supported version...")
        # You can add additional checks here to wait for the modification to be completed

print("All RDS instances using deprecated versions have been upgraded.")
```

Make sure to replace `'your_deprecated_version_1'`, `'your_deprecated_version_2'`, and `'your_supported_version'` with the actual deprecated and supported RDS versions provided by AWS.

Run this script in your AWS environment to remediate the issue of using deprecated RDS versions.
