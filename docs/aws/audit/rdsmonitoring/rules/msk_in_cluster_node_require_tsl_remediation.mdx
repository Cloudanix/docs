<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka) Cluster Encryption In Transit not being enabled in AWS using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Kafka Cluster with Encryption In Transit Enabled:**
   When creating a new MSK cluster, ensure that you specify the encryption in transit settings. Use the `create-cluster` command with the appropriate parameters.

   ```sh
   aws kafka create-cluster \
       --cluster-name YourClusterName \
       --broker-node-group-info file://broker-node-group-info.json \
       --kafka-version 2.6.0 \
       --number-of-broker-nodes 3 \
       --encryption-info '{"EncryptionInTransit": {"ClientBroker": "TLS"}}'
   ```

2. **Update an Existing Kafka Cluster to Enable Encryption In Transit:**
   If you need to update an existing cluster to enable encryption in transit, use the `update-cluster-configuration` command. Note that this operation might require a rolling restart of the cluster.

   ```sh
   aws kafka update-cluster-configuration \
       --cluster-arn arn:aws:kafka:region:account-id:cluster/YourClusterName/cluster-id \
       --configuration-info '{"Arn": "arn:aws:kafka:region:account-id:configuration/configuration-name/configuration-id", "Revision": 1}'
   ```

3. **Verify Encryption In Transit Settings:**
   To ensure that the encryption in transit settings are correctly applied, describe the cluster and check the encryption settings.

   ```sh
   aws kafka describe-cluster \
       --cluster-arn arn:aws:kafka:region:account-id:cluster/YourClusterName/cluster-id
   ```

   Look for the `EncryptionInTransit` settings in the output to confirm that `ClientBroker` is set to `TLS`.

4. **Automate Compliance Checks:**
   Use AWS Config to continuously monitor the compliance of your MSK clusters. Create a custom AWS Config rule to check that all MSK clusters have encryption in transit enabled.

   ```sh
   aws configservice put-config-rule \
       --config-rule file://config-rule.json
   ```

   Example `config-rule.json`:
   ```json
   {
       "ConfigRuleName": "msk-encryption-in-transit-enabled",
       "Description": "Checks whether MSK clusters have encryption in transit enabled.",
       "Scope": {
           "ComplianceResourceTypes": [
               "AWS::MSK::Cluster"
           ]
       },
       "Source": {
           "Owner": "CUSTOM_LAMBDA",
           "SourceIdentifier": "arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:your-lambda-function"
       }
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your MSK clusters have encryption in transit enabled, thereby preventing the misconfiguration.

   client = boto3.client('kafka')

   # Function to create an MSK cluster with encryption in transit enabled
   def create_msk_cluster(cluster_name, broker_node_group_info, kafka_version, number_of_broker_nodes):
       response = client.create_cluster(
           ClusterName=cluster_name,
           BrokerNodeGroupInfo=broker_node_group_info,
           KafkaVersion=kafka_version,
           NumberOfBrokerNodes=number_of_broker_nodes,
           EncryptionInfo={
               'EncryptionInTransit': {
                   'ClientBroker': 'TLS',  # Enable TLS encryption
                   'InCluster': True
               }
           }
       )
       return response

   # Example usage
   cluster_name = 'my-msk-cluster'
   broker_node_group_info = {
       'InstanceType': 'kafka.m5.large',
       'ClientSubnets': ['subnet-xxxxxxxx', 'subnet-yyyyyyyy'],
       'SecurityGroups': ['sg-xxxxxxxx']
   }
   kafka_version = '2.6.0'
   number_of_broker_nodes = 3

   response = create_msk_cluster(cluster_name, broker_node_group_info, kafka_version, number_of_broker_nodes)
   print(response)
   ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the Python script to create the MSK cluster with encryption in transit enabled.

   ```bash
   python create_msk_cluster.py
   ```

By following these steps, you ensure that the MSK cluster is created with encryption in transit enabled, thereby preventing the misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the RDS dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu and then selecting "RDS" under the "Database" category.
3. In the navigation pane, click on "DB Instances".
4. Select the RDS instance that you want to check.
5. In the details section, look for the "Security and Network" category. Under this category, check the "Encryption" field. If the field is set to "Disabled", then MSK Cluster Encryption In Transit is not enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the RDS resources.

2. Use the following command to list all the MSK clusters in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws kafka list-clusters --region your-region
   ```

   Replace 'your-region' with the region where your MSK clusters are located. This command will return a JSON output with details of all the MSK clusters.

3. Extract the cluster ARN from the output. You can use the following command to do this:

   ```
   aws kafka list-clusters --region your-region --query 'ClusterInfoList[*].ClusterArn' --output text
   ```

4. Now, use the following command to describe the encryption settings of each MSK cluster:

   ```
   aws kafka describe-cluster --region your-region --cluster-arn your-cluster-arn --query 'ClusterInfo.EncryptionInfo.EncryptionInTransit'
   ```

   Replace 'your-region' and 'your-cluster-arn' with your actual region and cluster ARN. This command will return the encryption settings of the specified MSK cluster. If the 'InCluster' value is 'false', then the MSK cluster encryption in transit is not enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if MSK Cluster Encryption In Transit is enabled in RDS using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS:**

```python
import boto3

# Create a session using your AWS credentials
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-1' # specify the region
)
```

2. **Create a client for MSK:**

```python
# Create a client for MSK
msk = session.client('kafka')
```

3. **List all the MSK clusters and check the encryption info:**

```python
# List all the MSK clusters
clusters = msk.list_clusters()

# Loop through each cluster
for cluster in clusters['ClusterInfoList']:
    # Get the cluster ARN
    cluster_arn = cluster['ClusterArn']
    
    # Describe the cluster to get more details
    cluster_details = msk.describe_cluster(ClusterArn=cluster_arn)
    
    # Check the encryption info
    encryption_info = cluster_details['ClusterInfo']['EncryptionInfo']
    
    # If 'InCluster' encryption is not enabled, print a message
    if not encryption_info['InCluster']:
        print(f"MSK Cluster {cluster_arn} does not have In Transit Encryption enabled.")
```

4. **Run the script:**

You can run the script using any Python environment. Make sure to replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your actual AWS access key and secret key. If the script prints any messages, that means those MSK clusters do not have In Transit Encryption enabled.

Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions to list and describe MSK clusters in your AWS account.
