How to enable backtrack for RDS

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon RDS service.
2. Click on the name of the RDS instance for which you want to enable event notifications.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Event Notifications Should Be Enabled" Policy.)
3. In the instance details page, click on the "Configuration" tab.
4. Under the "Database options" section, locate the "Event notifications" option.
5. Click on the "Edit" button next to the "Event notifications" option.
6. In the "Modify DB instance" window, select the checkbox for "Enable event notifications".
7. Specify the SNS topic to which the event notifications will be sent. You can choose an existing topic or create a new one by clicking on the "Create new SNS topic" link.
8. Optionally, you can customize the event categories for which you want to receive notifications. By default, all event categories are selected.
9. Specify the source type for the events. You can select "DB instance" to receive events related to a specific RDS instance or "DB cluster" to receive events related to an Aurora cluster.
10. Select the specific source identifier from the dropdown menu. This will be the name of the RDS instance or Aurora cluster for which you want to receive events.
11. Click on the "Apply immediately" checkbox to apply the changes immediately. If you don't select this option, the changes will be applied during the next maintenance window for the RDS instance.
12. Click on the "Modify DB instance" button to save the changes and enable event notifications.
13. Event notifications will now be enabled for the selected RDS instance. You will start receiving notifications about various database events to the specified SNS topic.

By following these steps, you can enable event notifications for Amazon RDS instances, allowing you to receive notifications about important database events. This helps you stay informed about changes, updates, and issues related to your RDS instances, and allows you to take appropriate actions as needed. Make sure that you have the necessary permissions to create SNS topics and subscribe to them for event notifications.
