### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration of RDS databases should have free storage space in AWS:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the RDS dashboard and select the database instance that you want to remediate.
3. Scroll down to the "Storage" section and check the "Allocated Storage" value.
4. Verify that the "Free Storage Space" value is greater than 0. If it is 0 or negative, then the database instance is not compliant with the misconfiguration.
5. To remediate this misconfiguration, you need to increase the "Allocated Storage" value of the database instance.
6. Click the "Modify" button on the top right of the screen.
7. In the "Modify DB Instance" page, scroll down to the "Storage" section.
8. Increase the "Allocated Storage" value to a value that provides enough free storage space for your database instance.
9. Click the "Apply Immediately" checkbox to apply the changes immediately.
10. Click the "Modify DB Instance" button to save the changes.

Once the modification is complete, the RDS database instance will have enough free storage space to comply with the misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

The following are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Databases Should Have Free Storage Space" for AWS using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. List all the RDS instances in your account using the following command:
```
aws rds describe-db-instances
```

3. Identify the RDS instance(s) that have low free storage space. You can check the "FreeStorageSpace" attribute in the output of the previous command.

4. Modify the RDS instance(s) to increase the storage space using the following command:
```
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <instance-id> --allocated-storage <new-storage-size>
```
Replace `<instance-id>` with the identifier of the RDS instance and `<new-storage-size>` with the new storage size in GB that you want to allocate to the instance.

5. Wait for the modification to complete. You can check the status of the modification using the following command:
```
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <instance-id> --query 'DBInstances[*].DBInstanceStatus'
```
Replace `<instance-id>` with the identifier of the RDS instance.

6. Verify that the free storage space has increased for the RDS instance(s) using the following command:
```
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <instance-id> --query 'DBInstances[*].FreeStorageSpace'
```
Replace `<instance-id>` with the identifier of the RDS instance.

7. Repeat steps 3-6 for all the RDS instances that have low free storage space.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Databases Should Have Free Storage Space" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Databases Should Have Free Storage Space" in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```python
import boto3
import datetime
```

2. Create a connection to AWS:

```python
client = boto3.client('rds')
```

3. Get the list of all RDS instances:

```python
response = client.describe_db_instances()
instances = response['DBInstances']
```

4. Loop through each RDS instance and check if there is free storage space available:

```python
for instance in instances:
    free_storage_space = instance['FreeStorageSpace']
    allocated_storage = instance['AllocatedStorage']
    if free_storage_space < allocated_storage * 0.1:
        # Perform remediation action
```

5. If there is not enough free storage space, perform remediation action:

```python
# Modify the instance to increase the storage space
response = client.modify_db_instance(
    DBInstanceIdentifier=instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'],
    AllocatedStorage=allocated_storage * 1.1,
    ApplyImmediately=True
)
```

6. Log the remediation action:

```python
print(f"Remediated RDS instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} by increasing storage space from {allocated_storage}GB to {allocated_storage * 1.1}GB on {datetime.datetime.now()}")
```

7. Repeat the above steps for all the RDS instances.

Note: In the above code, we are checking if the free storage space is less than 10% of the allocated storage space. You can modify this percentage as per your requirement.
