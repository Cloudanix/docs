<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent RDS databases from running out of free storage space using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Enable Storage Auto Scaling:**
   Ensure that your RDS instance has storage auto-scaling enabled. This will automatically increase the storage size when it reaches a threshold.

   ```sh
   aws rds modify-db-instance \
       --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> \
       --storage-auto-scaling-enabled
   ```

2. **Set Up CloudWatch Alarms:**
   Create CloudWatch alarms to monitor the free storage space and notify you when it falls below a certain threshold.

   ```sh
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
       --alarm-name "RDSFreeStorageSpaceAlarm" \
       --metric-name FreeStorageSpace \
       --namespace AWS/RDS \
       --statistic Average \
       --period 300 \
       --threshold <threshold-value-in-bytes> \
       --comparison-operator LessThanThreshold \
       --dimensions Name=DBInstanceIdentifier,Value=<your-db-instance-identifier> \
       --evaluation-periods 1 \
       --alarm-actions <sns-topic-arn>
   ```

3. **Modify Storage Type and Size:**
   Ensure that your RDS instance has an appropriate storage type and size to handle your workload.

   ```sh
   aws rds modify-db-instance \
       --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> \
       --allocated-storage <new-storage-size-in-gb> \
       --storage-type <storage-type>
   ```

4. **Enable Enhanced Monitoring:**
   Enable enhanced monitoring to get more detailed metrics about your RDS instance, which can help in proactive management.

   ```sh
   aws rds modify-db-instance \
       --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> \
       --monitoring-interval 60 \
       --monitoring-role-arn <iam-role-arn>
   ```

By following these steps, you can proactively manage and prevent your RDS databases from running out of free storage space using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent RDS databases from running out of free storage space using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Set Up AWS SDK (Boto3)**
First, ensure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### 2. **Create a Monitoring Script**
Create a Python script to monitor the free storage space of your RDS instances. This script will use CloudWatch to get the free storage space metrics and send alerts if the free storage space is below a certain threshold.

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize boto3 clients
rds_client = boto3.client('rds')
cloudwatch_client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

# Define the threshold for free storage space (in bytes)
FREE_STORAGE_THRESHOLD = 10 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024  # 10 GB

# Get the list of RDS instances
rds_instances = rds_client.describe_db_instances()

for instance in rds_instances['DBInstances']:
    db_instance_identifier = instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']
    
    # Get CloudWatch metrics for free storage space
    metrics = cloudwatch_client.get_metric_statistics(
        Namespace='AWS/RDS',
        MetricName='FreeStorageSpace',
        Dimensions=[
            {
                'Name': 'DBInstanceIdentifier',
                'Value': db_instance_identifier
            },
        ],
        StartTime=datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(minutes=10),
        EndTime=datetime.utcnow(),
        Period=300,
        Statistics=['Average']
    )
    
    # Check if the free storage space is below the threshold
    if metrics['Datapoints']:
        free_storage_space = metrics['Datapoints'][0]['Average']
        if free_storage_space < FREE_STORAGE_THRESHOLD:
            print(f"Warning: {db_instance_identifier} is running low on free storage space.")
```

### 3. **Automate Storage Scaling**
To prevent running out of storage, you can automate the process of increasing the storage size when the free storage space is below the threshold.

```python
def increase_storage(db_instance_identifier, current_allocated_storage):
    new_allocated_storage = current_allocated_storage + 20  # Increase by 20 GB
    rds_client.modify_db_instance(
        DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance_identifier,
        AllocatedStorage=new_allocated_storage,
        ApplyImmediately=True
    )
    print(f"Storage for {db_instance_identifier} increased to {new_allocated_storage} GB.")

for instance in rds_instances['DBInstances']:
    db_instance_identifier = instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']
    allocated_storage = instance['AllocatedStorage']
    
    # Get CloudWatch metrics for free storage space
    metrics = cloudwatch_client.get_metric_statistics(
        Namespace='AWS/RDS',
        MetricName='FreeStorageSpace',
        Dimensions=[
            {
                'Name': 'DBInstanceIdentifier',
                'Value': db_instance_identifier
            },
        ],
        StartTime=datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(minutes=10),
        EndTime=datetime.utcnow(),
        Period=300,
        Statistics=['Average']
    )
    
    # Check if the free storage space is below the threshold
    if metrics['Datapoints']:
        free_storage_space = metrics['Datapoints'][0]['Average']
        if free_storage_space < FREE_STORAGE_THRESHOLD:
            print(f"Warning: {db_instance_identifier} is running low on free storage space.")
            increase_storage(db_instance_identifier, allocated_storage)
```

### 4. **Schedule the Script**
Use a scheduling tool like cron (on Unix-based systems) or Task Scheduler (on Windows) to run the script at regular intervals to ensure continuous monitoring and automatic scaling.

For example, to run the script every hour using cron, you can add the following line to your crontab:

```bash
0 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py
```

By following these steps, you can effectively monitor and prevent your RDS databases from running out of free storage space using Python scripts.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Databases".

3. Select the name of the desired DB instance, which will open the "DB Instance Details" page.

4. Under the "Monitoring" tab, check the "Free Storage Space" metric. This metric shows the amount of available storage space. If the free storage space is less than your expected threshold, it indicates a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all RDS instances: Use the following command to list all the RDS instances in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier]'
   ```

   This command will return a list of all RDS instances in your account.

3. Check the free storage space: For each RDS instance, you can check the amount of free storage space using the following command:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <DBInstanceIdentifier> --query 'DBInstances[*].[FreeStorageSpace]'
   ```

   Replace `<DBInstanceIdentifier>` with the identifier of the RDS instance you want to check. This command will return the amount of free storage space in bytes.

4. Analyze the output: The output from the previous command will tell you how much free storage space is available for each RDS instance. If the amount of free storage space is low, it indicates a potential misconfiguration. You should ensure that your RDS instances have enough free storage space to operate effectively.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): 
   First, you need to install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) on your local machine. This can be done using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

   Then, configure your AWS credentials:

   ```
   aws configure
   ```

   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, which can be found in your AWS Management Console.

2. Import necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS:
   In your Python script, import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS. Here's an example:

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ```

3. Connect to the RDS service and retrieve the list of DB instances:
   Use the session to connect to the RDS service and retrieve the list of DB instances. Then, for each DB instance, retrieve the amount of free storage space. Here's an example:

   ```python
   rds = session.client('rds')

   response = rds.describe_db_instances()

   for db in response['DBInstances']:
       print(f"DBInstanceIdentifier: {db['DBInstanceIdentifier']}")
       print(f"Free storage space: {db['FreeStorageSpace']}")
   ```

4. Analyze the results:
   The script will print the DB instance identifier and the amount of free storage space for each DB instance. If the amount of free storage space is less than a certain threshold (e.g., 20% of the total storage space), it may indicate a misconfiguration. You can add a condition to the script to print a warning message in such cases:

   ```python
   for db in response['DBInstances']:
       print(f"DBInstanceIdentifier: {db['DBInstanceIdentifier']}")
       print(f"Free storage space: {db['FreeStorageSpace']}")
       if db['FreeStorageSpace'] < db['AllocatedStorage'] * 0.2:
           print("Warning: Free storage space is less than 20% of the total storage space.")
   ```
