### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Event Notification Subscriptions Should Be Enabled" in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the S3 service.
3. Select the bucket for which Event Notification Subscriptions should be enabled.
4. Click on the "Properties" tab.
5. Scroll down to the "Events" section and click on "Create Event Notification".
6. In the "Create Event Notification" wizard, select the type of event that you want to be notified about.
7. Choose the destination for the notification. This can be an SNS topic, an SQS queue, or a Lambda function.
8. Configure any additional settings for the notification, such as the prefix or suffix of the object key that triggers the event.
9. Review and confirm the settings, and then click on "Save".

Once you have completed these steps, Event Notification Subscriptions will be enabled for the selected bucket in AWS. Any events that match the criteria you specified will trigger a notification to the destination you selected.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Event Notification Subscriptions not being enabled in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to enable Event Notification Subscriptions for all S3 buckets in your AWS account:

```
aws s3api put-bucket-notification-configuration --bucket <bucket-name> --notification-configuration file://notification.json
```

Note: Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of the S3 bucket for which you want to enable Event Notification Subscriptions.

3. Create a `notification.json` file with the following content:

```
{
  "TopicConfigurations": [
    {
      "Id": "S3-event-notification",
      "TopicArn": "<topic-arn>",
      "Events": [
        "s3:ObjectCreated:*",
        "s3:ObjectRemoved:*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: Replace `<topic-arn>` with the ARN of the SNS topic to which you want to send the event notifications.

4. Save the `notification.json` file in the same directory where you are running the AWS CLI command.

5. Run the command and check if the Event Notification Subscriptions have been enabled successfully for the S3 bucket.

Note: Repeat these steps for all S3 buckets in your AWS account to ensure that Event Notification Subscriptions are enabled for all of them.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of "Event Notification Subscriptions Should Be Enabled" in AWS using Python, perform the following steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK libraries in Python:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Initialize the SNS client:

```python
sns_client = boto3.client('sns')
```

3. Create an SNS topic to receive the event notifications:

```python
response = sns_client.create_topic(Name='event-notifications')
topic_arn = response['TopicArn']
```

4. Enable event notification subscriptions for the required AWS services by creating an SNS subscription:

```python
response = sns_client.subscribe(
    TopicArn=topic_arn,
    Protocol='email',
    Endpoint='your-email@example.com'
)
```

Note: Replace "your-email@example.com" with your email address to receive the event notifications.

5. Verify the subscription by confirming the subscription request sent to your email address.

With these steps, the misconfiguration of "Event Notification Subscriptions Should Be Enabled" in AWS can be remediated using Python.
