How to use General Purpose SSDs instead of IOPS SSDs?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the target RDS instance:
   - Go to the Amazon RDS console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/).
   - Select the RDS instance for which you want to change the storage type.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "General Purpose SSDs Should Be Used Instead of IOPS SSDs" Policy.)
2. Check the existing storage type:
   - In the "Details" section of the RDS instance, locate the "Storage" information.
   - Note down the current storage type, which will be "Provisioned IOPS" for IOPS SSDs or "General Purpose" for General Purpose SSDs.
3. Create a new General Purpose SSD instance:
   - Before proceeding, it's recommended to create a snapshot of your existing RDS instance for backup purposes.
   - From the RDS console, select "Instances" in the left-hand navigation pane.
   - Click on "Launch DB Instance" to start the process of creating a new RDS instance.
   - Follow the steps to select the desired engine, instance type, and other configurations.
   - In the "Storage" configuration section, choose the "General Purpose" option for "Storage type".
   - Specify the desired storage capacity and other options.
   - Proceed through the remaining steps, configuring the instance as needed.
   - Review the summary and click on "Launch DB Instance" to create the new General Purpose SSD instance.
4. Migrate data to the new instance:
   - Once the new General Purpose SSD instance is created, you need to migrate your data from the existing RDS instance to the new one.
   - You can use various methods for data migration, such as using database backup and restore, using replication mechanisms, or utilizing AWS Database Migration Service (DMS).
   - Choose the migration method that suits your needs and follow the appropriate instructions to transfer the data from the old instance to the new General Purpose SSD instance.
5. Update the application connection settings:
   - After successfully migrating the data to the new General Purpose SSD instance, update your application's connection settings to point to the new instance.
   - Update the endpoint or connection string configuration in your application code or configuration files to reflect the new RDS instance.
6. Test and verify:
   - Once the application is connected to the new General Purpose SSD instance, thoroughly test its functionality to ensure that everything is working as expected.
   - Monitor the performance of the new instance to verify that it meets your application's requirements.
