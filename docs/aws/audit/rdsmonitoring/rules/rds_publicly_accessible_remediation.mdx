<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent RDS instances from being publicly accessible using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Describe the RDS Instances**:
   First, identify the RDS instances that are currently publicly accessible.
   ```sh
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query "DBInstances[*].{DBInstanceIdentifier:DBInstanceIdentifier,PubliclyAccessible:PubliclyAccessible}"
   ```

2. **Modify the RDS Instance**:
   For each RDS instance that is publicly accessible, modify the instance to disable public accessibility.
   ```sh
   aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> --publicly-accessible false --apply-immediately
   ```

3. **Verify the Changes**:
   After modifying the RDS instance, verify that the changes have been applied.
   ```sh
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> --query "DBInstances[*].PubliclyAccessible"
   ```

4. **Update Security Groups**:
   Ensure that the security groups associated with your RDS instances do not allow inbound traffic from the public internet (0.0.0.0/0).
   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <your-security-group-id>
   aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <your-security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port <your-db-port> --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your RDS instances are not publicly accessible, thereby enhancing the security of your database instances.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent RDS instances from being publicly accessible using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Below are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create a Boto3 Session**:
   Initialize a Boto3 session with your AWS credentials and region.

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='YOUR_AWS_REGION'
   )
   ```

3. **Describe RDS Instances**:
   Use the RDS client to describe your RDS instances and check their public accessibility.

   ```python
   rds_client = session.client('rds')

   def get_rds_instances():
       response = rds_client.describe_db_instances()
       return response['DBInstances']

   rds_instances = get_rds_instances()
   ```

4. **Modify RDS Instances to Disable Public Accessibility**:
   Iterate through the RDS instances and modify those that are publicly accessible to disable this setting.

   ```python
   def disable_public_accessibility(instance_id):
       rds_client.modify_db_instance(
           DBInstanceIdentifier=instance_id,
           PubliclyAccessible=False,
           ApplyImmediately=True
       )

   for instance in rds_instances:
       if instance['PubliclyAccessible']:
           print(f"Disabling public accessibility for instance: {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']}")
           disable_public_accessibility(instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'])
   ```

This script will ensure that all your RDS instances are not publicly accessible by modifying their settings if they are found to be publicly accessible.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Databases".

3. Choose the name of the RDS instance that you want to check.

4. In the "Connectivity & security" tab, under "Security" section, look for "Public accessibility". If the value is "Yes", then the RDS instance is publicly accessible.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can run any AWS CLI commands, you need to install the AWS CLI on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```

   During the configuration process, you will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all RDS instances: Use the `describe-db-instances` command to list all your RDS instances. This command returns a JSON object that contains all your RDS instances.

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances
   ```

3. Parse the output: The output of the previous command includes a lot of information. You are interested in the `DBInstances` array, which contains information about each RDS instance. More specifically, you are interested in the `PubliclyAccessible` attribute of each instance, which indicates whether the instance is publicly accessible or not.

   You can use the `jq` command-line JSON processor to parse the output and filter out the instances that are publicly accessible. Here is an example:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances | jq -r '.DBInstances[] | select(.PubliclyAccessible == true) | .DBInstanceIdentifier'
   ```

4. Review the results: The previous command returns the identifiers of all RDS instances that are publicly accessible. If the command doesn't return any identifiers, it means that none of your RDS instances are publicly accessible. If the command returns one or more identifiers, it means that those instances are publicly accessible and you should take action to secure them.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The primary library you need is boto3, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call any AWS services. You can pass these credentials directly in your python script (not recommended) or you can configure it once using the AWS CLI and then boto3 will automatically use those credentials. Here is how you can configure it:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   AWS Access Key ID [None]: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   Default region name [None]: YOUR_REGION_NAME
   Default output format [None]: json
   ```

3. Write the Python script: Now you can write a Python script that uses boto3 to check if any RDS instances are publicly accessible. Here is a simple script that does this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_rds_public_accessibility():
       rds = boto3.client('rds')
       instances = rds.describe_db_instances()
       for instance in instances['DBInstances']:
           if instance['PubliclyAccessible']:
               print(f"RDS instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} is publicly accessible")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_rds_public_accessibility()
   ```

   This script first creates a client for the RDS service. It then calls the describe_db_instances method to get a list of all RDS instances. It then iterates over each instance and checks if the 'PubliclyAccessible' attribute is True. If it is, it prints a message with the instance identifier.

4. Run the Python script: Finally, you can run the Python script using the Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python check_rds_public_accessibility.py
   ```

   This will print out the identifiers of any RDS instances that are publicly accessible. If no instances are publicly accessible, it will not print anything.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the issue of RDS instances being publicly accessible in AWS, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to RDS Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page, select "RDS" under the Database category.

3. **Select the RDS Instance**: From the list of RDS instances, select the instance that you want to modify to make it not publicly accessible.

4. **Modify the Security Group**: In the details page of the selected RDS instance, scroll down to the "Security" section and click on the link for the associated Security Group.

5. **Edit Inbound Rules**: In the Security Group page, click on the "Inbound rules" tab and locate the rule that allows inbound traffic from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) on the database port (usually 3306 for MySQL, 5432 for PostgreSQL, etc.).

6. **Remove the Public Access Rule**: Select the rule that allows public access (0.0.0.0/0) and click on the "Actions" dropdown menu. Then, click on "Delete rule".

7. **Add a Rule for Specific IP**: If you still need to access the RDS instance from specific IP addresses, you can add a new inbound rule that allows traffic only from those IP addresses. Click on the "Add rule" button, select the type of rule (e.g., MySQL/Aurora, PostgreSQL), and specify the IP range or specific IPs that should be allowed to access the RDS instance.

8. **Review and Apply Changes**: Review the changes you have made to the Security Group and ensure that only necessary IP addresses have access to the RDS instance. Once you are satisfied, click on the "Save rules" button to apply the changes.

9. **Verify Public Accessibility**: Finally, go back to the RDS instance details page and verify that the instance is no longer publicly accessible by checking the "Publicly Accessible" attribute. It should be set to "No".

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the issue of RDS instances being publicly accessible in AWS.
