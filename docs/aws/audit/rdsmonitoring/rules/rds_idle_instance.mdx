How to identify idle RDS DB instances and delete them?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Amazon RDS service by selecting "RDS" from the services menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "RDS instances Should Not Be Idle" Policy.)
3. In the RDS dashboard, click on "Databases" in the left navigation pane.
4. Identify the RDS database instances that are idle and need to be deleted.
5. Click on the checkbox next to the database instance(s) you want to delete.
6. Above the list of database instances, click on the "Actions" button.
7. In the dropdown menu, select "Delete".
8. A confirmation window will appear. Read the warning carefully as deleting a database instance is irreversible and will result in permanent data loss.
9. If you are certain that you want to proceed, click on the "Delete" button to initiate the deletion process.
10. The deletion process may take some time to complete, depending on the size of the database and associated resources.
11. Once the deletion is finished, the RDS database instance will be permanently removed from your AWS account.
12. Repeat these steps for any other idle RDS database instances that need to be deleted.
13. After the deletion, ensure that any applications or systems relying on the deleted database instance are updated accordingly to avoid disruptions.
