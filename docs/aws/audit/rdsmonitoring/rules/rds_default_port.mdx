### More Info:

Port obfuscation is as an additional layer of defense against non-targeted attacks. In order to leverage this, your Amazon RDS databases instances should not use their default ports (MySQL/Aurora port 3306, SQL Server port 1433, PostgreSQL port 5432)

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the steps to remediate the RDS Database Instances Should Not Use Default Ports misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon RDS service.
3. Select the RDS instance that uses the default port.
4. Click on the "Modify" button.
5. In the "Network & Security" section, scroll down to the "Connectivity" section.
6. Change the port number to a non-default port number (e.g. 1433 for SQL Server or 3307 for MySQL).
7. Click on the "Continue" button.
8. Review the changes and click on the "Modify DB instance" button to apply the changes.

That's it! Your RDS instance is now using a non-default port number, which helps to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your database.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Database Instances Should Not Use Default Ports" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AWS account and open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Identify the RDS database instances that are using default ports. You can use the following AWS CLI command to list all the RDS instances in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances
   ```

3. Once you have identified the RDS instances that are using default ports, you need to modify the security group associated with the RDS instance to restrict access to non-default ports. You can use the following AWS CLI command to modify the security group:

   ```
   aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <RDS_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER> --vpc-security-group-ids <SECURITY_GROUP_ID>
   ```

   Replace `<RDS_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIER>` with the identifier of the RDS instance that you want to modify and `<SECURITY_GROUP_ID>` with the ID of the security group that you want to associate with the RDS instance.

4. Finally, you need to verify that the security group associated with the RDS instance has been modified successfully. You can use the following AWS CLI command to describe the security group:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <SECURITY_GROUP_ID>
   ```

   Replace `<SECURITY_GROUP_ID>` with the ID of the security group that you associated with the RDS instance in step 3.

   Verify that the inbound rules of the security group allow access only to the non-default ports that are required for your application.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Database Instances Should Not Use Default Ports" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Database Instances Should Not Use Default Ports" in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary Python libraries: boto3 and botocore.

```
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

2. Create a boto3 client for RDS.

```
rds = boto3.client('rds')
```

3. Use the describe_db_instances() method to get a list of all RDS instances.

```
response = rds.describe_db_instances()
```

4. Iterate through the list of instances and check if they are using the default port.

```
for instance in response['DBInstances']:
    db_port = instance['Endpoint']['Port']
    if db_port == 3306:
        # If the instance is using the default port, modify the port number
        try:
            rds.modify_db_instance(
                DBInstanceIdentifier=instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'],
                ApplyImmediately=True,
                DBInstanceClass=instance['DBInstanceClass'],
                Engine=instance['Engine'],
                MasterUsername=instance['MasterUsername'],
                MasterUserPassword=instance['MasterUserPassword'],
                Port=3307  # Change the port number to a non-default port
            )
            print("Instance {} has been updated with a non-default port number.".format(instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']))
        except ClientError as e:
            print("Error updating instance {}: {}".format(instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'], e))
    else:
        print("Instance {} is already using a non-default port number.".format(instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']))
```

5. Run the Python script to remediate the misconfiguration.

This Python script will iterate through all RDS instances in your AWS account and modify the port number to a non-default value if the instance is currently using the default port. The new port number (3307 in this example) can be changed to any other non-default port number as needed.
