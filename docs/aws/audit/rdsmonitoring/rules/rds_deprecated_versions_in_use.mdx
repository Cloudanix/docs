### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of using deprecated RDS versions in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon RDS console.
3. In the left navigation pane, click on "DB Instances".
4. Select the RDS instance that is using the deprecated version.
5. Click on the "Modify" button.
6. In the "Modify DB Instance" page, scroll down to the "Database Options" section.
7. In the "Database Engine Version" drop-down menu, select the latest version that is compatible with your application.
8. Click on the "Continue" button.
9. Review the changes and click on the "Modify DB Instance" button to apply the changes.

Once the RDS instance is updated to the latest version, make sure to test the application to ensure it is working properly.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of using deprecated RDS versions in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the RDS instances that are running deprecated versions. You can do this using the AWS CLI command: 

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query "DBInstances[?EngineVersion<'13.3'].[DBInstanceIdentifier, Engine, EngineVersion]" --output table
   ```

   This command will list all the RDS instances that are running deprecated versions.

2. Upgrade the RDS instances to the latest version using the AWS CLI command:

   ```
   aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <instance-name> --engine-version <latest-version> --apply-immediately
   ```

   Replace `<instance-name>` with the name of the RDS instance that needs to be upgraded and `<latest-version>` with the latest version of the database engine that is supported by AWS.

3. Verify the upgrade by checking the RDS instance details using the AWS CLI command:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <instance-name> --query "DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,Engine,EngineVersion]" --output table
   ```

   This command will display the upgraded RDS instance details.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all the RDS instances that are running deprecated versions.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of using deprecated RDS versions in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of deprecated RDS versions in use in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Identify the RDS instances that are using deprecated versions. This can be done using the AWS CLI command:

```
aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[?EngineVersion < `desired version`]'
```

Replace `desired version` with the version of RDS engine that you want to use. 

2. Create a new RDS instance with the desired version of the engine using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import boto3

rds = boto3.client('rds')

response = rds.restore_db_instance_to_point_in_time(
    SourceDBInstanceIdentifier='your-source-db-instance-identifier',
    TargetDBInstanceIdentifier='your-target-db-instance-identifier',
    RestoreTime=datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 15),
    UseLatestRestorableTime=True,
    DBInstanceClass='db.t2.micro',
    Port=3306,
    MultiAZ=False,
    PubliclyAccessible=False,
    AutoMinorVersionUpgrade=False,
    LicenseModel='general-public-license',
    DBName='your-db-name',
    Engine='your-engine',
    EngineVersion='your-engine-version',
    MasterUsername='your-master-username',
    MasterUserPassword='your-master-user-password',
    OptionGroupName='your-option-group-name'
)
```

Replace the placeholders with the relevant values for your use case.

3. Verify that the new RDS instance is running with the desired version of the engine using the AWS CLI command:

```
aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[?DBInstanceIdentifier == `your-target-db-instance-identifier`].EngineVersion'
```

This should return the version of the engine that you specified in the Python code.

4. Once you have verified that the new RDS instance is running with the desired version of the engine, you can delete the old RDS instance using the AWS CLI command:

```
aws rds delete-db-instance --db-instance-identifier your-source-db-instance-identifier --skip-final-snapshot
```

This will delete the old RDS instance without taking a final snapshot.

Note: Make sure to take a backup of your RDS instance before making any changes.
