How to remediate RDS Deprecated Versions

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Amazon RDS service by selecting "RDS" from the services menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "AWS Deprecated RDS Versions In Use" Policy.)
3. In the RDS dashboard, click on "Databases" in the left navigation pane.
4. Identify the RDS database instances that are running deprecated versions of databases.
5. Take note of the specific database instance(s) and the deprecated version(s) they are running.
6. Create a backup of the database instance(s) to ensure you have a restore point in case any issues arise during the remediation process. This step is optional but recommended for safety.
7. Determine the target version of the database that is considered current and supported.
8. In the RDS dashboard, select the checkbox next to the database instance(s) you want to remediate.
9. Above the list of database instances, click on the "Actions" button.
10. In the dropdown menu, select "Modify".
11. In the "Modify DB Instance" page, locate the "DB Engine version" or similar setting.
12. Select the desired target version from the available options that are supported and not deprecated.
13. Review any additional settings or configurations that may need to be adjusted based on the version upgrade. This may include adjusting allocated storage, instance class, or other parameters.
14. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Modify DB Instance" button to initiate the modification process.
15. The modification process will take some time, during which the database instance may experience a brief interruption or slowdown.
16. Monitor the modification progress in the RDS dashboard. Once the modification is complete, the database instance will be running the updated, non-deprecated version.
17. Validate the functionality and compatibility of the upgraded database version with your applications and perform any necessary testing to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
18. Repeat these steps for each database instance running a deprecated version until all instances have been remediated.
