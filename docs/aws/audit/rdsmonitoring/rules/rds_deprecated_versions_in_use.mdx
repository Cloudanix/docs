<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the use of deprecated RDS versions in AWS using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **List Available RDS Engine Versions:**
   Before creating or upgrading an RDS instance, you should list the available engine versions to ensure you are using a supported version.
   ```sh
   aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --engine mysql
   ```

2. **Create RDS Instance with a Specific Engine Version:**
   When creating a new RDS instance, specify a non-deprecated engine version.
   ```sh
   aws rds create-db-instance \
       --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
       --db-instance-class db.t2.micro \
       --engine mysql \
       --engine-version 8.0.23 \
       --allocated-storage 20 \
       --master-username admin \
       --master-user-password password
   ```

3. **Modify Existing RDS Instance to Upgrade Engine Version:**
   If you have an existing RDS instance running a deprecated version, you can modify it to upgrade to a supported version.
   ```sh
   aws rds modify-db-instance \
       --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
       --engine-version 8.0.23 \
       --apply-immediately
   ```

4. **Enable Auto Minor Version Upgrade:**
   Ensure that your RDS instances are configured to automatically apply minor version upgrades, which helps in keeping the database engine up-to-date.
   ```sh
   aws rds modify-db-instance \
       --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
       --auto-minor-version-upgrade
   ```

By following these steps, you can prevent the use of deprecated RDS versions in AWS using the AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the use of deprecated RDS versions in AWS using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **List Available RDS Engine Versions:**
   Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all available RDS engine versions. This will help you identify which versions are currently supported and which are deprecated.

   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_rds_engine_versions():
       client = boto3.client('rds')
       response = client.describe_db_engine_versions()
       for version in response['DBEngineVersions']:
           print(f"Engine: {version['Engine']}, Version: {version['EngineVersion']}")

   list_rds_engine_versions()
   ```

2. **Check Current RDS Instances:**
   Retrieve the list of all RDS instances and their engine versions to identify any instances running deprecated versions.

   ```python
   def list_rds_instances():
       client = boto3.client('rds')
       response = client.describe_db_instances()
       for instance in response['DBInstances']:
           print(f"DBInstanceIdentifier: {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']}, Engine: {instance['Engine']}, EngineVersion: {instance['EngineVersion']}")

   list_rds_instances()
   ```

3. **Compare and Identify Deprecated Versions:**
   Compare the current RDS instances' engine versions with the list of supported versions to identify any deprecated versions in use.

   ```python
   def identify_deprecated_versions():
       client = boto3.client('rds')
       supported_versions = [version['EngineVersion'] for version in client.describe_db_engine_versions()['DBEngineVersions']]
       response = client.describe_db_instances()
       for instance in response['DBInstances']:
           if instance['EngineVersion'] not in supported_versions:
               print(f"Deprecated Version Found: {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} is using {instance['EngineVersion']}")

   identify_deprecated_versions()
   ```

4. **Automate Version Enforcement:**
   Create a script to automatically enforce the use of supported RDS engine versions by updating instances running deprecated versions. This script should be used with caution and ideally tested in a non-production environment first.

   ```python
   def enforce_supported_versions():
       client = boto3.client('rds')
       supported_versions = [version['EngineVersion'] for version in client.describe_db_engine_versions()['DBEngineVersions']]
       response = client.describe_db_instances()
       for instance in response['DBInstances']:
           if instance['EngineVersion'] not in supported_versions:
               print(f"Updating {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} from {instance['EngineVersion']} to {supported_versions[-1]}")
               client.modify_db_instance(
                   DBInstanceIdentifier=instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'],
                   EngineVersion=supported_versions[-1],
                   ApplyImmediately=True
               )

   enforce_supported_versions()
   ```

These steps will help you prevent the use of deprecated RDS versions in AWS by identifying and updating instances running unsupported versions.

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the RDS dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu, then selecting "RDS" under the "Database" category.
3. In the navigation pane on the left, click on "Databases". This will display a list of all your RDS instances.
4. For each instance, check the "Engine version" column. If the version listed is deprecated, it means that the RDS instance is using a deprecated version.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all RDS instances: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the RDS instances in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,Engine,EngineVersion]'
   ```
   This command will return a list of all RDS instances along with their engine and engine version.

3. Check for deprecated versions: Now, you need to manually check the returned list for any deprecated RDS versions. AWS regularly updates the list of deprecated RDS versions on their official documentation. You need to compare the versions in your list with the versions in the AWS documentation.

4. Automate the process with a Python script: If you have a large number of RDS instances, it might be more efficient to automate the process with a Python script. You can use the `boto3` library to interact with AWS services. The script would do essentially the same thing as the manual process: list all RDS instances and their versions, and then check for any deprecated versions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing your Python script, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3` in your terminal.

2. Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS: In your Python script, you'll need to import the Boto3 library and establish a session with AWS. Here's how you can do that:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Connect to the RDS service and retrieve all DB instances: Now that you have a session established, you can connect to the RDS service and retrieve all DB instances. Here's how you can do that:

```python
rds = session.client('rds')

response = rds.describe_db_instances()

for instance in response['DBInstances']:
    print("DBInstanceIdentifier: ", instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'])
    print("Engine: ", instance['Engine'])
    print("EngineVersion: ", instance['EngineVersion'])
```

4. Check for deprecated RDS versions: Now that you have a list of all DB instances, you can check each one to see if it's using a deprecated RDS version. Here's how you can do that:

```python
deprecated_versions = ['5.5', '5.6', '9.3']  # replace with actual deprecated versions

for instance in response['DBInstances']:
    if instance['EngineVersion'] in deprecated_versions:
        print("DBInstanceIdentifier: ", instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'], "is using a deprecated RDS version.")
```

This script will print out the identifiers of all DB instances that are using a deprecated RDS version.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of using deprecated RDS versions in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the deprecated RDS versions in use**:
   - Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all the RDS instances in your account.
   - Check the engine version of each RDS instance against the list of deprecated versions provided by AWS.

2. **Upgrade the RDS instances**:
   - For each RDS instance using a deprecated version, create a snapshot of the instance.
   - Modify the RDS instance to upgrade to a supported version using the `modify_db_instance` method in Boto3.
   - Wait for the modification to be completed before proceeding to the next step.

3. **Test the upgraded RDS instances**:
   - Verify that the RDS instances are functioning correctly after the upgrade.
   - Check if any applications or services relying on these RDS instances are working as expected.

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Once you have confirmed that all RDS instances have been successfully upgraded, you can delete the snapshots created in step 2 to save costs and reduce clutter in your account.

Here is a sample Python script to help you get started:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the RDS client
rds_client = boto3.client('rds')

# List all RDS instances
response = rds_client.describe_db_instances()

# Deprecated RDS versions provided by AWS
deprecated_versions = ['your_deprecated_version_1', 'your_deprecated_version_2']

for db_instance in response['DBInstances']:
    # Check if the RDS instance is using a deprecated version
    if db_instance['EngineVersion'] in deprecated_versions:
        # Create a snapshot of the RDS instance
        snapshot_response = rds_client.create_db_snapshot(
            DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'],
            DBSnapshotIdentifier=f"{db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']}-snapshot"
        )
        
        # Modify the RDS instance to upgrade to a supported version
        rds_client.modify_db_instance(
            DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'],
            EngineVersion='your_supported_version'
        )
        
        print(f"Upgrading RDS instance {db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} to a supported version...")
        # You can add additional checks here to wait for the modification to be completed

print("All RDS instances using deprecated versions have been upgraded.")
```

Make sure to replace `'your_deprecated_version_1'`, `'your_deprecated_version_2'`, and `'your_supported_version'` with the actual deprecated and supported RDS versions provided by AWS.

Run this script in your AWS environment to remediate the issue of using deprecated RDS versions.
