How to limit RDS instance count?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Set up AWS Organizations: If you haven't already, create an AWS Organizations account to manage multiple AWS accounts under a hierarchy.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "RDS Instance Count Should Not Exceed Limit" Policy.)
2. Create an SCP: In the AWS Organizations management console, create a new SCP that limits the RDS instance count. SCPs are defined in JSON format and consist of statements that define permissions and restrictions.
3. Define the policy: In the SCP, specify the maximum number of RDS instances allowed by using the `rds:CreateDBInstance` condition with a value of the desired limit.
4. Apply the SCP to an organizational unit (OU): Assign the SCP to the OU where the AWS accounts that need to be limited reside. This will enforce the policy on those accounts.
5. Test and refine the policy: Verify that the policy is applied correctly by attempting to create additional RDS instances beyond the limit. Monitor any error messages or denials to ensure the policy is working as expected.
6. Adjust the SCP as needed: If you need to modify the RDS instance limit or apply the policy to different OUs or accounts, update the SCP accordingly.
