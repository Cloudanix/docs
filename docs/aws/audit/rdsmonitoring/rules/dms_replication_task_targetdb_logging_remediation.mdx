<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the RDS instances.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the DMS replication tasks using the following command:

   ```
   aws dms describe-replication-tasks
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the DMS replication tasks.

3. From the output, identify the replication task for which you want to check the target DB logging status. Note down the 'TargetEndpointArn' of the replication task.

4. Now, use the 'TargetEndpointArn' to describe the target endpoint and get the details of the RDS instance:

   ```
   aws dms describe-endpoints --filters Name=endpoint-arn,Values=<TargetEndpointArn>
   ```
   Replace `<TargetEndpointArn>` with the actual ARN of the target endpoint. This command will return a JSON output with details of the target endpoint.

5. From the output, identify the 'EngineName' and 'EndpointIdentifier' which represents the RDS instance. Now, use the following command to check the logging status of the RDS instance:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <EndpointIdentifier>
   ```
   Replace `<EndpointIdentifier>` with the actual identifier of the RDS instance. This command will return a JSON output with details of the RDS instance.

6. In the output, look for the 'EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports' field. If this field is present and contains the value 'postgresql', then logging is enabled for the RDS instance. If this field is not present or does not contain the value 'postgresql', then logging is not enabled for the RDS instance.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your local environment. Boto3 allows you to directly create, update, and delete AWS services from your Python scripts.

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials.

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION_NAME'
)
```

3. Use the `describe_replication_tasks()` function to retrieve a list of all DMS Replication Tasks. 

```python
dms = session.client('dms')
response = dms.describe_replication_tasks()
```

4. Iterate over the list of replication tasks and for each task, check if the target RDS instance has logging enabled. You can do this by using the `describe_db_instances()` function and checking the `CloudWatchLogsExportConfiguration` attribute.

```python
rds = session.client('rds')

for task in response['ReplicationTasks']:
    db_instance_identifier = task['TargetEndpointArn'].split(":")[-1]
    db_instance = rds.describe_db_instances(DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance_identifier)
    if 'CloudWatchLogsExportConfiguration' not in db_instance['DBInstances'][0] or \
       'EnableLogTypes' not in db_instance['DBInstances'][0]['CloudWatchLogsExportConfiguration'] or \
       len(db_instance['DBInstances'][0]['CloudWatchLogsExportConfiguration']['EnableLogTypes']) == 0:
        print(f"Logging is not enabled for the target DB of the replication task: {task['ReplicationTaskIdentifier']}")
```

This script will print out the identifiers of the replication tasks whose target RDS instances do not have logging enabled.

2. **Navigate to RDS Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page, select "RDS" under the Database category.

3. **Select the RDS Instance**: From the list of RDS instances, select the target database instance for which you want to enable logging.

4. **Enable Logging**: In the RDS dashboard for the selected instance, click on the "Modify" button to make changes to the instance configuration.

5. **Enable Enhanced Monitoring**: Scroll down to the "Database options" section, find the "Enable Enhanced Monitoring" option, and select the appropriate logging level (e.g., detailed monitoring).

6. **Enable Performance Insights**: If needed, scroll down further to the "Performance Insights" section and enable it for better monitoring and troubleshooting.

7. **Review and Apply Changes**: Review the changes you have made to ensure that logging is enabled for the RDS instance. Once you are satisfied, click on the "Apply immediately" button to apply the changes.

8. **Monitor Replication Task**: After enabling logging for the RDS instance, monitor the DMS Replication Task to ensure that it is now able to replicate data successfully with logging enabled on the target database.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration of DMS Replication Task Target DB not having logging enabled for AWS RDS using the AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of DMS Replication Task target DB not having logging enabled for an AWS RDS instance using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Enable logging on the RDS instance**:
   Use the following AWS CLI command to modify the RDS instance and enable logging:
   ```
   aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> --enable-iam-database-authentication
   ```

   Replace `<your-db-instance-identifier>` with the actual identifier of your RDS instance.

2. **Verify the changes**:
   You can verify that the logging is enabled on the RDS instance by describing the instance using the following command:
   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier>
   ```

   This command will return the details of the RDS instance, including the logging status.

3. **Update the DMS Replication Task**:
   After enabling logging on the RDS instance, you need to update the DMS Replication Task to use the updated target database. Use the following AWS CLI command to modify the replication task:
   ```
   aws dms modify-replication-task --replication-task-arn <your-replication-task-arn> --target-settings "{\"Logging\":true}"
   ```

   Replace `<your-replication-task-arn>` with the actual ARN of your DMS Replication Task.

4. **Verify the Replication Task**:
   You can verify that the replication task has been successfully updated by describing the task using the following command:
   ```
   aws dms describe-replication-tasks --filters Name=replication-task-arn,Values=<your-replication-task-arn>
   ```

   This command will return the details of the replication task, including the target settings.

   # Initialize the RDS client
   rds_client = boto3.client('rds')

   # Specify the target RDS DB identifier
   target_db_identifier = 'your_target_db_identifier'

   # Enable logging for the target DB
   response = rds_client.modify_db_instance(
       DBInstanceIdentifier=target_db_identifier,
       EnableCloudwatchLogsExports=['audit', 'error', 'general', 'slowquery']
   )

   print("Logging enabled for the target DB:", target_db_identifier)
   ```

   Make sure to replace `'your_target_db_identifier'` with the actual identifier of your target RDS DB.

4. Run the Python script:
   Save the above Python script in a file (e.g., `enable_logging.py`) and run it using the Python interpreter:
   ```
   python enable_logging.py
   ```
