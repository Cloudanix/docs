### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Snapshots". This will open a list of all the snapshots available in your AWS account.

3. Select the DB cluster snapshot that you want to examine. In the "Snapshot Details" section, look for the "Public" attribute. If the attribute value is set to "Yes", then the selected Amazon Neptune DB cluster snapshot is publicly accessible.

4. To confirm, you can also check the "Permissions" tab for the selected snapshot. If the "Public" access level is set to "Everyone", then the snapshot is publicly accessible.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the RDS resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the DB cluster snapshots by using the following command:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-cluster-snapshots
   ```
   This command will return a JSON output with details of all the DB cluster snapshots.

3. To check if a DB cluster snapshot is public, you need to look at the 'PubliclyAccessible' attribute in the JSON output. If the value of this attribute is 'true', then the DB cluster snapshot is public.

4. You can use the following command to filter out the public DB cluster snapshots:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-cluster-snapshots --query 'DBClusterSnapshots[?PubliclyAccessible==`true`]'
   ```
   This command will return a list of DB cluster snapshots that are public. If the list is empty, then there are no public DB cluster snapshots.

#### Using Python

To check if a Neptune DB Cluster Snapshot is public in RDS using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary libraries**: You need to import Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python, to interact with AWS services.

    ```python
    import boto3
    ```

2. **Create a session**: You need to create a session using your AWS credentials.

    ```python
    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
        region_name='us-west-2'
    )
    ```

3. **Create a client for RDS**: You need to create a client for RDS to interact with the service.

    ```python
    rds = session.client('rds')
    ```

4. **List and check all DB Cluster Snapshots**: You need to list all DB Cluster Snapshots and check their 'PubliclyAccessible' attribute. If it's set to 'true', then the snapshot is public.

    ```python
    def check_public_snapshots(rds):
        snapshots = rds.describe_db_cluster_snapshots()
        for snapshot in snapshots['DBClusterSnapshots']:
            if snapshot['PubliclyAccessible']:
                print(f"Snapshot {snapshot['DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier']} is public")

    check_public_snapshots(rds)
    ```

This script will print out the identifiers of all public Neptune DB Cluster Snapshots. If there are no public snapshots, it won't print anything.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of Neptune DB Cluster Snapshot being public in AWS RDS using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console and login using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to Amazon Neptune Console**: Click on the "Services" dropdown at the top of the page, search for "Neptune" and click on it.

3. **Select Neptune DB Cluster**: In the Neptune dashboard, click on the Neptune DB cluster for which you want to remediate the issue.

4. **Choose Snapshots from the left-hand menu**: In the navigation pane on the left, click on "Snapshots" to view all the snapshots associated with the selected Neptune DB cluster.

5. **Select the Public Snapshot**: Identify the snapshot that is public by checking the "Public" column in the snapshot list.

6. **Modify Snapshot Permissions**: Click on the checkbox next to the public snapshot to select it. Then, click on the "Modify Snapshot Permissions" button at the top of the snapshot list.

7. **Remove Public Access**: In the "Modify Snapshot Permissions" window, uncheck the option that allows public access to the snapshot. This will ensure that the snapshot is no longer public.

8. **Save Changes**: Click on the "Save Changes" button to apply the new permissions to the snapshot.

9. **Verify Changes**: Verify that the snapshot is no longer public by checking the "Public" column in the snapshot list.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the issue of the Neptune DB Cluster Snapshot being public in AWS RDS using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of Neptune DB Cluster Snapshot being public in AWS RDS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Public Snapshots**: First, identify the Neptune DB Cluster Snapshots that are public. You can use the following AWS CLI command to list all the Neptune DB Cluster Snapshots and filter out the public snapshots:

```bash
aws neptune describe-db-cluster-snapshots --query "DBClusterSnapshots[?PubliclyAccessible=='true']"
```

2. **Modify Snapshot Attributes**: Once you have identified the public snapshots, you can modify the snapshot attributes to make them private. Use the following AWS CLI command to modify the snapshot attribute and set `PubliclyAccessible` to `false` for each public snapshot:

```bash
aws neptune modify-db-cluster-snapshot-attribute --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <snapshot-identifier> --attribute-name "PubliclyAccessible" --values "false"
```

Replace `<snapshot-identifier>` with the actual identifier of the public snapshot.

3. **Verify the Changes**: After modifying the snapshot attributes, you can verify that the Neptune DB Cluster Snapshots are no longer public by running the describe command mentioned in step 1.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of Neptune DB Cluster Snapshot being public in AWS RDS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of Neptune DB Cluster Snapshot being public in AWS RDS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Public Snapshots**: First, you need to identify the Neptune DB Cluster Snapshots that are public. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all the Neptune DB Cluster Snapshots and check their permissions.

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('neptune')

response = client.describe_db_cluster_snapshots()

for snapshot in response['DBClusterSnapshots']:
    if snapshot['PubliclyAccessible']:
        print(f"Public Snapshot found: {snapshot['DBClusterSnapshotArn']}")
```

2. **Update Snapshot Permissions**: For each public snapshot identified, you can modify its permissions to make it private. You can use the `modify_db_cluster_snapshot_attribute` method to update the snapshot's `PubliclyAccessible` attribute to `False`.

```python
for snapshot in response['DBClusterSnapshots']:
    if snapshot['PubliclyAccessible']:
        snapshot_arn = snapshot['DBClusterSnapshotArn']
        client.modify_db_cluster_snapshot_attribute(
            DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier=snapshot_arn,
            AttributeName='restore',
            ValuesToRemove=['all']
        )
        print(f"Snapshot {snapshot_arn} is now private.")
```

3. **Verify Changes**: After updating the permissions, you should verify that the Neptune DB Cluster Snapshots are no longer public. You can re-run the script to list the snapshots and confirm that none of them have the `PubliclyAccessible` attribute set to `True`.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of Neptune DB Cluster Snapshots being public in AWS RDS using Python.
