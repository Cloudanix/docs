<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the issue of Neptune DB Cluster Snapshot being public in AWS RDS using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console and login using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to Amazon Neptune Console**: Click on the "Services" dropdown at the top of the page, search for "Neptune" and click on it.

3. **Select Neptune DB Cluster**: In the Neptune dashboard, click on the Neptune DB cluster for which you want to remediate the issue.

4. **Choose Snapshots from the left-hand menu**: In the navigation pane on the left, click on "Snapshots" to view all the snapshots associated with the selected Neptune DB cluster.

5. **Select the Public Snapshot**: Identify the snapshot that is public by checking the "Public" column in the snapshot list.

6. **Modify Snapshot Permissions**: Click on the checkbox next to the public snapshot to select it. Then, click on the "Modify Snapshot Permissions" button at the top of the snapshot list.

7. **Remove Public Access**: In the "Modify Snapshot Permissions" window, uncheck the option that allows public access to the snapshot. This will ensure that the snapshot is no longer public.

8. **Save Changes**: Click on the "Save Changes" button to apply the new permissions to the snapshot.

9. **Verify Changes**: Verify that the snapshot is no longer public by checking the "Public" column in the snapshot list.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the issue of the Neptune DB Cluster Snapshot being public in AWS RDS using the AWS Management Console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the issue of Neptune DB Cluster Snapshot being public in AWS RDS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Public Snapshots**: First, identify the Neptune DB Cluster Snapshots that are public. You can use the following AWS CLI command to list all the Neptune DB Cluster Snapshots and filter out the public snapshots:

```bash
aws neptune describe-db-cluster-snapshots --query "DBClusterSnapshots[?PubliclyAccessible=='true']"
```

2. **Modify Snapshot Attributes**: Once you have identified the public snapshots, you can modify the snapshot attributes to make them private. Use the following AWS CLI command to modify the snapshot attribute and set `PubliclyAccessible` to `false` for each public snapshot:

```bash
aws neptune modify-db-cluster-snapshot-attribute --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <snapshot-identifier> --attribute-name "PubliclyAccessible" --values "false"
```

Replace `<snapshot-identifier>` with the actual identifier of the public snapshot.

3. **Verify the Changes**: After modifying the snapshot attributes, you can verify that the Neptune DB Cluster Snapshots are no longer public by running the describe command mentioned in step 1.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of Neptune DB Cluster Snapshot being public in AWS RDS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of Neptune DB Cluster Snapshot being public in AWS RDS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Public Snapshots**: First, you need to identify the Neptune DB Cluster Snapshots that are public. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list all the Neptune DB Cluster Snapshots and check their permissions.

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('neptune')

response = client.describe_db_cluster_snapshots()

for snapshot in response['DBClusterSnapshots']:
    if snapshot['PubliclyAccessible']:
        print(f"Public Snapshot found: {snapshot['DBClusterSnapshotArn']}")
```

2. **Update Snapshot Permissions**: For each public snapshot identified, you can modify its permissions to make it private. You can use the `modify_db_cluster_snapshot_attribute` method to update the snapshot's `PubliclyAccessible` attribute to `False`.

```python
for snapshot in response['DBClusterSnapshots']:
    if snapshot['PubliclyAccessible']:
        snapshot_arn = snapshot['DBClusterSnapshotArn']
        client.modify_db_cluster_snapshot_attribute(
            DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier=snapshot_arn,
            AttributeName='restore',
            ValuesToRemove=['all']
        )
        print(f"Snapshot {snapshot_arn} is now private.")
```

3. **Verify Changes**: After updating the permissions, you should verify that the Neptune DB Cluster Snapshots are no longer public. You can re-run the script to list the snapshots and confirm that none of them have the `PubliclyAccessible` attribute set to `True`.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of Neptune DB Cluster Snapshots being public in AWS RDS using Python.
