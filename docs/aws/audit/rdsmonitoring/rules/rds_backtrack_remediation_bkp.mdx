How to enable backtrack for RDS?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon RDS service.
2. Click on the name of the RDS instance for which you want to enable backtrack.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Backtrack Feature Should Be Enabled" Policy.)
3. In the instance details page, click on the "Configuration" tab.
4. Under the "Database options" section, locate the "Backtrack" option.
5. Click on the "Edit" button next to the "Backtrack" option.
6. In the "Modify DB instance" window, select the checkbox for "Enable backtrack".
7. Specify the number of minutes you want to retain backtrack information. This determines the duration for which you can go back in time using the backtrack feature.
8. Click on the "Apply immediately" checkbox to apply the changes immediately. If you don't select this option, the changes will be applied during the next maintenance window for the RDS instance.
9. Click on the "Modify DB instance" button to save the changes and enable backtrack.
10. Once backtrack is enabled, you can use the "Backtrack" feature to revert the RDS instance to a specific point in time within the retention period.
