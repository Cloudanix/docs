How to enable snapshot encryption feature?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the left navigation panel, under Amazon RDS, click Snapshots.

- Step 2: Select a snapshot tab from the snapshot category tabs to list all related RDS snapshots owned by your AWS account.

- Step 3: Select the unencrypted RDS snapshot that you want to encrypt (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource).

- Step 4: Click the Actions dropdown button from the dashboard top menu and select Copy Snapshot.

- Step 5: On the Copy Snapshot page, perform the following commands:
  A: From the Destination Region dropdown list, select the region to write the copy of the selected snapshot.
  B: In the New DB Snapshot Identifier box, type a unique name/identifier for the new RDS snapshot (copy).
  C: (Optional) From Target Option Group dropdown, select an option group to associate with your target database snapshot.
  D: (Optional) Select Copy Tags checkbox if you want your new snapshot to have the same tags as the source snapshot.
  E: In the Encryption section, select Enable encryption to turn on encryption at rest for the new RDS snapshot. Select (default) aws/rds from the Master Key dropdown list to use the default master key (also known as AWS Managed Key), a predefined key that protects your RDS database snapshot when no other key is defined for this purpose.
  F: Click Copy Snapshot to confirm the action. The process will take a couple of minutes to complete. Once created, you should see the encrypted RDS snapshot (copy) with the Status set to available, listed on the Snapshots page

- Step 6: Now that your Amazon RDS database snapshot is encrypted, you can safely delete the unencrypted snapshot. To remove the required RDS snapshot from your AWS account, perform the following actions:
  A: Select the source AWS RDS snapshot that you want to delete.
  B: Click the Actions dropdown button from the dashboard top menu and select Delete Snapshot.
  C: Inside Delete snapshot-name Snapshot dialog box, click Delete to confirm your action.
