How to enable encryption for RDS database instances.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Amazon RDS service by selecting "RDS" from the services menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "RDS Instances Should Have Encryption Enabled" Policy.)
3. In the RDS dashboard, click on "Databases" in the left navigation pane.
4. Locate the RDS database instance(s) for which encryption is not enabled.
5. Click on the checkbox next to the database instance(s) you want to remediate.
6. Above the list of database instances, click on the "Actions" button.
7. In the dropdown menu, select "Modify".
8. In the "Modify DB Instance" page, scroll down to the "Storage" section.
9. In the "Storage" section, locate the "Encryption" option.
10. Select the option to enable encryption for the database instance(s).
11. Choose the type of encryption you want to use:
    - AWS Key Management Service (KMS): Select the default AWS KMS key or choose a customer-managed KMS key.
    - AWS Managed CMK: Allow AWS to manage the encryption keys for you.
12. If you choose a customer-managed KMS key, select the appropriate key from the dropdown menu.
13. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Modify DB Instance" button to save the changes.
14. The modification process may take a few minutes to complete. Once finished, encryption will be enabled for the selected RDS database instance(s).
15. Repeat these steps for any other RDS database instances that need encryption enabled.
16. After the modification is complete, verify that encryption is enabled by checking the "Encryption" column in the RDS dashboard.
