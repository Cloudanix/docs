1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the RDS dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu and then selecting "RDS" under the "Database" category.
3. In the navigation pane, click on "Databases".
4. Select the database instance that you want to check. In the "Details" section, look for the "Maintenance & backups" field.
5. Under "Maintenance & backups", check the "Auto minor version upgrade" status. If it is set to "No", then the DMS Replication Auto Minor Version Upgrade is not enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all DMS replication instances: Use the `describe-replication-instances` command to list all DMS replication instances in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws dms describe-replication-instances
   ```
   This command will return a JSON object that contains information about all your DMS replication instances.

3. Parse the output: You can parse the output using a tool like `jq` to extract the `AutoMinorVersionUpgrade` property for each replication instance.

   ```
   aws dms describe-replication-instances | jq '.ReplicationInstances[] | .AutoMinorVersionUpgrade'
   ```
   This command will return either `true` or `false` for each replication instance, indicating whether or not the Auto Minor Version Upgrade is enabled.

4. Check the output: If the command returns `false` for any replication instance, it means that the Auto Minor Version Upgrade is not enabled for that instance. This is a misconfiguration that should be corrected.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if DMS Replication Auto Minor Version Upgrade is enabled in RDS using Python scripts, you can use the boto3 library, which allows you to directly interact with AWS services, including RDS. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS:**

    ```python
    import boto3
    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
        region_name='us-west-2'
    )
    ```

    Replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your actual AWS access key and secret key. The region name should be the region where your RDS instances are located.

2. **Create a client for RDS:**

    ```python
    rds = session.client('rds')
    ```

3. **Retrieve all DMS Replication instances and check their Auto Minor Version Upgrade setting:**

    ```python
    def check_auto_minor_version_upgrade():
        response = rds.describe_db_instances()
        for instance in response['DBInstances']:
            if instance['Engine'] == 'mysql' and not instance['AutoMinorVersionUpgrade']:
                print(f"DB instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} has Auto Minor Version Upgrade disabled")
    ```

    This function retrieves all DB instances and checks if they are MySQL instances with Auto Minor Version Upgrade disabled. If it finds any, it prints their identifiers.

4. **Call the function to start the check:**

    ```python
    check_auto_minor_version_upgrade()
    ```

    This will print the identifiers of all MySQL DB instances with Auto Minor Version Upgrade disabled.

Please note that this script only checks MySQL instances. If you have DB instances with other engines, you should modify the script accordingly. Also, the script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to list and describe DB instances.

   import boto3

   # Define the AWS region and the name of the RDS DB cluster
   region = 'your_aws_region'
   db_cluster_identifier = 'your_db_cluster_identifier'

   # Create a RDS client
   rds_client = boto3.client('rds', region_name=region)

   # Get the current DB cluster parameter group for the RDS instance
   response = rds_client.describe_db_clusters(
       DBClusterIdentifier=db_cluster_identifier
   )
   db_cluster_parameter_group = response['DBClusters'][0]['DBClusterParameterGroup']

   # Modify the parameter group to enable DMS Replication Auto Minor Version Upgrade
   response = rds_client.modify_db_cluster_parameter_group(
       DBClusterParameterGroupName=db_cluster_parameter_group,
       Parameters=[
           {
               'ParameterName': 'dms_auto_minor_version_upgrade',
