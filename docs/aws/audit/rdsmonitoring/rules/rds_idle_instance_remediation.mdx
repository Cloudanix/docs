How to identify idle RDS DB instances and delete them?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the left navigation panel, under the RDS Dashboard section, choose Instances.

- Step 2: Select the idle RDS database instance to terminate (see Audit section part I to identify the right resource).

- Step 3: Click the Instance Actions dropdown button from the dashboard top menu and select Delete.

- Step 4: On the Delete DB Instance confirmation page, select Yes from the Create final Snapshot dropdown menu and enter a unique name for your last database backup (snapshot) in the Final snapshot name box. Cloud Conformity strongly recommends taking a final snapshot of your database before termination because once the selected instance is deleted the RDS automated backups will no longer be available.

- Step 5: Click the Delete button to terminate the instance.
