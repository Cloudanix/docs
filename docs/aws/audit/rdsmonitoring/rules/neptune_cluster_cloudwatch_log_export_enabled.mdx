1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to RDS dashboard. In the navigation pane, choose "Databases".
3. In the list of database instances, select the Neptune cluster that you want to check.
4. In the details pane, under the "Configuration" tab, look for the "CloudWatch Logs exports" section. If no logs are listed, then the Neptune cluster does not have CloudWatch Log Exports enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the RDS resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can list all the Neptune DB clusters using the following command:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-clusters --query 'DBClusters[?Engine==`neptune`].DBClusterIdentifier' --output text
   ```
   This command will return the identifiers of all the Neptune DB clusters.

3. For each Neptune DB cluster, you can check if CloudWatch Logs export is enabled using the following command:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <DBClusterIdentifier> --query 'DBInstances[*].{DBInstanceIdentifier:DBInstanceIdentifier,EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports:EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports}'
   ```
   Replace `<DBClusterIdentifier>` with the identifier of the Neptune DB cluster. This command will return the CloudWatch Logs exports settings for the specified DB cluster.

4. If the `EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports` field is empty or does not contain `audit`, `error`, `general`, or `slowquery`, it means that CloudWatch Logs export is not enabled for the Neptune DB cluster.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if Neptune Cluster Should Have CloudWatch Log Exports Enabled in RDS using python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set up AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, configure your AWS credentials. You can configure your credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using AWS CLI.

2. **List all Neptune Clusters:**
   Use the `describe_db_clusters()` function to list all the Neptune clusters. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('rds')

   response = client.describe_db_clusters()

   for cluster in response['DBClusters']:
       print(cluster['DBClusterIdentifier'])
   ```
   This script will print the identifiers of all the Neptune clusters.

3. **Check CloudWatch Log Exports:**
   For each Neptune cluster, check if CloudWatch Log Exports are enabled. You can do this by checking the `EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports` field of the cluster. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('rds')

   response = client.describe_db_clusters()

   for cluster in response['DBClusters']:
       if 'EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports' in cluster:
           print(f"Cluster {cluster['DBClusterIdentifier']} has CloudWatch Log Exports enabled.")
       else:
           print(f"Cluster {cluster['DBClusterIdentifier']} does not have CloudWatch Log Exports enabled.")
   ```
   This script will print whether each Neptune cluster has CloudWatch Log Exports enabled.

4. **Handle Exceptions:**
   While running these scripts, you might encounter exceptions due to insufficient permissions or service limits. Make sure to handle these exceptions to avoid breaking the script. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3
   from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError, BotoCoreError

   client = boto3.client('rds')

   try:
       response = client.describe_db_clusters()
   except NoCredentialsError:
       print("No AWS credentials found.")
   except BotoCoreError as e:
       print(f"Error: {e}")
   ```
   This script will catch and print any exceptions that occur while describing the Neptune clusters.
