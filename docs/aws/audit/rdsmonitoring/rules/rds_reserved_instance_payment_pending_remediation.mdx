<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of RDS Reserved Instances having a status of "Payment Pending" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. List all the Reserved Instances in your AWS account to identify the one with the status "Payment Pending":
   
```bash
aws rds describe-reserved-db-instances
```

2. Identify the Reserved Instance with the status "Payment Pending" in the output.

3. Modify the Reserved Instance to change its status from "Payment Pending" to "Active" by using the `modify-db-instance` command:

```bash
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> --reserved-db-instance-id <your-reserved-instance-id> --apply-immediately
```

Replace `<your-db-instance-identifier>` with the identifier of your RDS DB instance and `<your-reserved-instance-id>` with the ID of the Reserved Instance that has the status "Payment Pending".

4. Wait for the modification to be completed. You can check the status of the Reserved Instance again using the `describe-reserved-db-instances` command:

```bash
aws rds describe-reserved-db-instances
```

5. Verify that the status of the Reserved Instance has been successfully changed to "Active".

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of RDS Reserved Instances having a status of "Payment Pending" in AWS using the AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of RDS Reserved Instances having a status of "Payment Pending" in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary Python libraries:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Initialize the AWS RDS client:
```python
rds_client = boto3.client('rds')
```

3. Describe all the Reserved Instances for RDS:
```python
reserved_instances = rds_client.describe_reserved_db_instances()
```

4. Iterate through each Reserved Instance and check if its status is "Payment Pending":
```python
for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedDBInstances']:
    if reserved_instance['State'] == 'payment-pending':
        reserved_instance_id = reserved_instance['ReservedDBInstanceId']
        # Modify the status of the Reserved Instance to active
        rds_client.modify_reserved_db_instances(
            ReservedDBInstanceId=reserved_instance_id,
            ReservedDBInstancePaymentType='ALL_UPFRONT'  # You can choose the appropriate payment type
        )
```

5. After running the above script, the status of the RDS Reserved Instances with "Payment Pending" should be remediated to the desired status.

Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions to describe and modify RDS Reserved Instances in your AWS account. Also, ensure that you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed in your environment.
