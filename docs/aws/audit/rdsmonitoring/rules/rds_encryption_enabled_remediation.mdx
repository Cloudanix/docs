How to enable RDS Instances encryption?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the navigation panel, under RDS Dashboard, click Instances and select the RDS database instance you want to encrypt.

- Step 2: Click Instance Actions button from the dashboard top menu and select Take Snapshot.

- Step 3: On the Snapshot page, enter a name for the instance snapshot in the Snapshot Name field and click Take Snapshot (the backup process may take few minutes and depends on storage size).

- Step 4: Select the new created snapshot and click the Copy Snapshot button from the dashboard top menu.

- Step 5: On the Make Copy of DB Snapshot page, perform the following:
  A: In the New DB Snapshot Identifier field, enter a name for the new snapshot (copy)
  B: Check Copy Tags so the new snapshot can have the same tags as the source snapshot.
  C: Select Yes from the Enable Encryption dropdown list. You can choose to use the AWS default encryption key or your custom key (key ARN required) by selecting it from the Master Key dropdown list.

- Step 6: Click Copy Snapshot to create an encrypted copy of the selected instance snapshot.

- Step 7: Select the new snapshot copy (encrypted) and click the Restore Snapshot button from the dashboard top menu. This will restore the encrypted snapshot to a new database instance.

- Step 8: On the Restore DB Instance page, enter a unique name for the new database instance in the DB Instance Identifier\* field.

- Step 9: Review the instance configuration details and click Restore DB Instance.

- Step 10: As soon as the new instance provisioning process is completed (its status becomes available), you can update your application configuration to refer to the endpoint:
  of the new (encrypted) database instance. Once the database endpoint is changed at your application level, you can remove the unecrypted instance.
