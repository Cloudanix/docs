### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Instances Should Have Encryption Enabled" for AWS using AWS console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console:
   Log in to your AWS account.

2. Navigate to the RDS Console:
   Go to the Amazon RDS console by selecting "RDS" from the AWS services or by navigating directly to [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/).

3. Click on "Create Database":
   Choose the "Create Database" button to start the process of creating a new database instance.

4. Select the Engine and Version:
   Choose the database engine you want to use (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) and the version.

5. Specify DB Details:
   Fill in the necessary information for your database, including the DB instance identifier, master username, and password.

6. Configure Advanced Settings:
   Scroll down to the "Advanced Settings" section, and within that section, you will find an option for "Encryption." Expand the "Encryption" section.

7. Enable Encryption:
   In the "Encryption" section, you'll find an option to enable encryption. Choose the appropriate option, such as "Enable encryption" or "Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt."

8. Choose the KMS Key:
   If you choose to use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption, you'll need to select a KMS key. You can either use the default key or choose a custom KMS key.

9. Configure Other Settings:
   Continue configuring other settings for your database as needed, such as the instance type, storage, and other parameters.

10. Review and Launch:
    Review all the configurations you've made, and when you're satisfied, click the "Create Database" button.

11. Wait for the Database to be Created:
    The AWS console will display the status of the database creation. Wait until the status changes to "available."

Enabling encryption during the creation of an RDS instance ensures that the data stored in the database is encrypted at rest, providing an additional layer of security for your sensitive information.

#### Using CLI

To enable Amazon RDS database encryption using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) while creating a database, you can use the `create-db-instance` command with the `--storage-encrypted` and `--kms-key-id` options. Below are the steps:

1. Open a Command Line Interface:
   Open your preferred command line interface, such as the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or a terminal.

2. Run the `create-db-instance` Command:
   Use the following command as a template, and replace the placeholder values with your specific information:

   ```bash
   aws rds create-db-instance \
     --db-instance-identifier YourDBInstanceIdentifier \
     --db-instance-class db.t2.micro \
     --engine YourDBEngine \
     --master-username YourMasterUsername \
     --master-user-password YourMasterUserPassword \
     --allocated-storage YourAllocatedStorage \
     --storage-encrypted \
     --kms-key-id YourKMSKeyId
   ```

   - `YourDBInstanceIdentifier`: Replace this with a unique identifier for your DB instance.
   - `YourDBEngine`: Replace this with the database engine you want to use (e.g., `mysql`, `postgres`, etc.).
   - `YourMasterUsername` and `YourMasterUserPassword`: Replace these with the master username and password for your database.
   - `YourAllocatedStorage`: Replace this with the allocated storage for your DB instance.
   - `YourKMSKeyId`: Replace this with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or alias of the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key you want to use for encryption. You can use the default key if you don't have a specific one.

3. Example Command:
   Here's an example command with placeholder values:

   ```bash
   aws rds create-db-instance \
     --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
     --db-instance-class db.t2.micro \
     --engine mysql \
     --master-username admin \
     --master-user-password mysecretpassword \
     --allocated-storage 20 \
     --storage-encrypted \
     --kms-key-id alias/aws/rds
   ```

4. Wait for the Database to be Created:
   After running the command, wait for the AWS CLI to create the database. You can check the status using the AWS Management Console or the `describe-db-instances` command.

Enabling `--storage-encrypted` ensures that the RDS storage is encrypted, and `--kms-key-id` specifies the KMS key to be used for encryption. Adjust the command parameters based on your specific requirements and database configuration.

#### Using Python

To enable Amazon RDS database encryption using Python and the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) while creating a database, you can use the `create_db_instance` method from the `boto3.client('rds')` service client. Below is an example script:

```python
import boto3

def create_encrypted_rds_instance():
    # Replace these values with your specific information
    db_instance_identifier = 'YourDBInstanceIdentifier'
    db_instance_class = 'db.t2.micro'
    engine = 'YourDBEngine'
    master_username = 'YourMasterUsername'
    master_password = 'YourMasterUserPassword'
    allocated_storage = 20  # Replace with your desired storage size
    kms_key_id = 'YourKMSKeyId'  # Replace with the ARN or alias of your KMS key

    # Create an RDS client
    rds_client = boto3.client('rds')

    # Define the parameters for the create_db_instance API call
    parameters = {
        'DBInstanceIdentifier': db_instance_identifier,
        'DBInstanceClass': db_instance_class,
        'Engine': engine,
        'MasterUsername': master_username,
        'MasterUserPassword': master_password,
        'AllocatedStorage': allocated_storage,
        'StorageEncrypted': True,
        'KmsKeyId': kms_key_id
    }

    # Make the create_db_instance API call
    response = rds_client.create_db_instance(**parameters)

    # Print the response or perform additional actions as needed
    print("DB instance creation response:", response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_encrypted_rds_instance()
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values in the script with your specific information. This script uses Boto3 to interact with the AWS RDS service and creates a new encrypted DB instance.

Note: Ensure that you have the Boto3 library installed. You can install it using:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

Also, ensure that your AWS credentials are properly configured on your machine. You can either set up environment variables or use the AWS CLI to configure credentials.
