### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the RDS instances underutilization issue in AWS using AWS Console, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to your AWS Console and navigate to the RDS dashboard.

2. Select the underutilized RDS instance that you want to remediate.

3. Click on the "Modify" button at the top of the page.

4. In the "Modify DB Instance" page, scroll down to the "Settings" section.

5. In the "Settings" section, you will see the "Allocated Storage" field. Increase the allocated storage to a value that is more appropriate for the instance's usage. This will help to ensure that the instance is not underutilized.

6. Next, scroll down to the "DB Instance Class" section. In this section, you can change the instance type to a more appropriate size that matches the workload requirements of the database.

7. Once you have made the necessary changes, click on the "Apply Immediately" checkbox, and then click on the "Modify DB Instance" button.

8. AWS will apply the changes immediately, and your RDS instance will no longer be underutilized.

Note: It is important to monitor your RDS instances regularly to ensure that they are not underutilized or overutilized. Overutilization can also lead to performance issues.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Instances Should Not Be Underutilized" for AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Identify the underutilized RDS instances by running the following command:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[?DBInstanceStatus==`available` && DBInstanceClass=="db.t2.micro" && DBInstanceIdentifier!=`rdsadmin` && (DBInstanceIdentifier!=`<instance-id>`)]' --output text
   ```

   This command will list all the RDS instances that are available, running on `db.t2.micro` instance class, and not in `rdsadmin` or `<instance-id>`.

2. Check the CPU utilization of each underutilized RDS instance by running the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/RDS --metric-name CPUUtilization --dimensions Name=DBInstanceIdentifier,Value=<instance-id> --start-time $(date +%s --date '2 minutes ago') --end-time $(date +%s) --period 120 --statistics Average --unit Percent
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the actual RDS instance identifier from the previous command.

3. If the CPU utilization of the RDS instance is consistently below 20%, you can modify the instance to a smaller instance class by running the following command:

   ```
   aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <instance-id> --db-instance-class db.t2.small --apply-immediately
   ```

   This command will modify the RDS instance to a smaller instance class `db.t2.small`.

4. Verify the RDS instance modification by running the following command:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <instance-id> --query 'DBInstances[0].DBInstanceClass'
   ```

   This command will return the new instance class of the modified RDS instance.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Instances Should Not Be Underutilized" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of underutilized RDS instances in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Collect data on RDS instances
- Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to retrieve information about all RDS instances in the account.
- Collect data on CPU utilization, memory utilization, and storage usage for each RDS instance.

Step 2: Identify underutilized RDS instances
- Define a threshold for minimum CPU and memory utilization. For example, if an RDS instance has less than 20% CPU utilization and less than 50% memory utilization, it can be considered underutilized.
- Identify RDS instances that fall below the threshold and flag them as underutilized.

Step 3: Resize underutilized RDS instances
- Use the modify_db_instance() method in Boto3 to resize the underutilized RDS instances.
- Increase the instance class to a higher size to improve performance and utilization.
- Monitor the resized instances to ensure that they are now being fully utilized.

Step 4: Automate the process
- Create a Python script that can be run on a schedule to automatically check for underutilized RDS instances and resize them as needed.
- Set up alerts to notify the appropriate team members when an RDS instance is resized or when an instance continues to be underutilized.

Note: Before resizing any RDS instance, make sure to check for any potential impact on the application or database that is using the instance. It's also important to consider the cost implications of resizing an instance to a higher size.
