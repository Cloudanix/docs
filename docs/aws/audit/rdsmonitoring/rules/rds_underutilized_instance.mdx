How to identify any underutilized Amazon RDS database instances?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Analyze Database Workload:
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "RDS Instances Should Not Be Underutilized" Policy.)
   - Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics and RDS performance insights to understand the resource utilization patterns of your RDS instance.
   - Identify periods of low utilization or idle times when the instance is not fully utilizing its allocated resources.
2. Take a Snapshot (Recommended):
   - Before downsizing, it's advisable to create a snapshot of your RDS instance to have a backup of your data.
   - Open the Amazon RDS console, select your RDS instance, and click on the "Actions" button.
   - Choose "Take snapshot" and provide a descriptive name for the snapshot.
   - Wait for the snapshot creation to complete before proceeding to the next steps.
3. Modify DB Instance:
   - In the Amazon RDS console, select your RDS instance that you want to downsize.
   - Click on the "Modify" button to change the instance settings.
   - In the "Modify DB instance" window, select a smaller instance size that better matches your workload requirements.
   - Review other configuration options if necessary, such as storage, Multi-AZ deployment, etc.
4. Apply Changes:
   - Select the checkbox for "Apply immediately" to apply the changes immediately.
   - If you don't select this option, the changes will be applied during the next maintenance window for the RDS instance.
5. Confirm Modifications:
   - Review the summary of the modifications to ensure they are correct.
   - Click on the "Modify DB instance" button to proceed with the downsizing process.
6. Monitor the Downsizing Process:
   - Monitor the modification progress in the Amazon RDS console.
   - The instance may experience a brief interruption during the modification process, depending on the instance type and configuration changes.
7. Validate and Test:
   - After the downsizing process is complete, monitor the performance of your RDS instance to ensure it meets your workload requirements.
   - Test your applications and database functionality to verify that everything is working as expected.
8. Adjust Other Resources (if necessary):
   - Consider adjusting other resources such as storage size, IOPS, and allocated memory based on the downsized instance configuration and workload requirements.
