### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. Select the instance for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.
3. Stop the instance to make changes.
4. Click on the instance and select "Actions" and then click on "Create Image" to create a backup of the instance.
5. Once the image is created, select the instance again and click on "Actions" and then click on "Launch Instance".
6. In the "Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)" page, select the image that you have created in step 4.
7. In the "Choose an Instance Type" page, select the instance type that uses General Purpose SSDs instead of IOPS SSDs.
8. Configure the instance as per your requirement and launch it.
9. Once the new instance is launched, verify that the instance is running without any issues.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of using IOPS SSDs instead of General Purpose SSDs in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Login to AWS CLI using your credentials.
2. Identify the instance for which you want to change the EBS volume type.
3. Stop the instance to detach the EBS volume from the instance.
4. Use the following command to modify the EBS volume type:
```
aws ec2 modify-volume --volume-id <volume-id> --volume-type gp2
```
Replace the `<volume-id>` with the actual ID of the EBS volume that you want to modify.
5. Start the instance again and attach the modified EBS volume to it.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of using general purpose SSDs instead of IOPS SSDs in AWS.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "General Purpose SSDs Should Be Used Instead of IOPS SSDs" for AWS using Python, follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDKs for Python (Boto3) and create an EC2 client object.

```
import boto3

ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
```

2. Get a list of all the EBS volumes in the AWS account.

```
ebs_volumes = ec2_client.describe_volumes()
```

3. Loop through each EBS volume and check if it is using IOPS SSDs.

```
for volume in ebs_volumes['Volumes']:
    if volume['VolumeType'] == 'io1':
        print('Volume {} is using IOPS SSDs.'.format(volume['VolumeId']))
```

4. If a volume is using IOPS SSDs, modify the volume to use General Purpose SSDs.

```
ec2_client.modify_volume(
    VolumeId=volume['VolumeId'],
    VolumeType='gp2'
)
```

5. Once the volume has been modified, print a message indicating the volume has been remediated.

```
print('Volume {} has been remediated to use General Purpose SSDs.'.format(volume['VolumeId']))
```

6. The final code should look like this:

```
import boto3

ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

ebs_volumes = ec2_client.describe_volumes()

for volume in ebs_volumes['Volumes']:
    if volume['VolumeType'] == 'io1':
        ec2_client.modify_volume(
            VolumeId=volume['VolumeId'],
            VolumeType='gp2'
        )
        print('Volume {} has been remediated to use General Purpose SSDs.'.format(volume['VolumeId']))
```

This code will loop through all the EBS volumes in the AWS account and remediate any volumes that are using IOPS SSDs to use General Purpose SSDs instead.
