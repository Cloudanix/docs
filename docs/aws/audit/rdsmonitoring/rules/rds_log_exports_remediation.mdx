### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Log Exports Should Be Enabled" for AWS using AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Log in to your AWS console.
2. Go to the CloudTrail service.
3. Select the trail for which you want to enable log exports.
4. Click on the "Edit" button.
5. Scroll down to the "S3 bucket" section.
6. Check the box next to "Export logs to Amazon S3".
7. Select the S3 bucket where you want to export the logs.
8. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

After following these steps, your CloudTrail logs will be exported to the specified S3 bucket. This will remediate the misconfiguration "Log Exports Should Be Enabled" for AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Log Exports Should Be Enabled" for AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to enable log exports for all the AWS services in your account:

```
aws cloudtrail update-trail --name <trail-name> --include-global-service-events --enable-log-file-validation --s3-bucket-name <bucket-name> --s3-key-prefix <prefix-name> --is-multi-region-trail
```

Here, replace `<trail-name>` with the name of the trail you want to update, `<bucket-name>` with the name of the S3 bucket where you want to store the logs, and `<prefix-name>` with the prefix you want to use for the log file names.

2. Run the following command to verify that the log exports have been enabled:

```
aws cloudtrail describe-trails --name-list <trail-name>
```

This command will return the details of the trail you just updated, including the S3 bucket and prefix where the logs will be stored.

3. Repeat the above steps for all the AWS accounts and regions in your organization to ensure that log exports are enabled for all the services.

Note: You can also enable log exports for specific services by modifying the above command and specifying the `--include-global-service-events` parameter with the service name.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Log Exports Should Be Enabled" for AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to import the necessary libraries and initialize the AWS client using the boto3 library.

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('logs')
```

2. Next, you need to get the list of all the log groups in the AWS account using the `describe_log_groups()` method.

```python
response = client.describe_log_groups()
log_groups = response['logGroups']
```

3. Once you have the list of log groups, you can iterate over each log group and check if log exports are enabled or not using the `describe_export_tasks()` method.

```python
for log_group in log_groups:
    export_tasks = client.describe_export_tasks(
        logGroupName=log_group['logGroupName']
    )['exportTasks']
    
    if not export_tasks:
        print(f"Log exports are not enabled for {log_group['logGroupName']}.")
    else:
        print(f"Log exports are enabled for {log_group['logGroupName']}.")
```

4. If log exports are not enabled for a log group, you can enable it using the `create_export_task()` method.

```python
response = client.create_export_task(
    taskName='export_task_name',
    logGroupName=log_group['logGroupName'],
    fromTime=from_time,
    to=to_time,
    destination='destination_arn',
    destinationPrefix='destination_prefix'
)
```

Note: You need to replace the `export_task_name`, `from_time`, `to_time`, `destination_arn`, and `destination_prefix` with the appropriate values.

5. Finally, you can run the above code to check and enable log exports for all the log groups in the AWS account.
