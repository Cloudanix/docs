### More Info:

Your Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) snapshots should be encrypted in order to achieve compliance for data-at-rest encryption within your organization

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

HIPAA, GDPR, NIST

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step by step instructions to enable snapshot encryption feature in AWS:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.

2. From the EC2 dashboard, click on the "Snapshots" option from the left-hand navigation menu.

3. Select the snapshot for which you want to enable encryption.

4. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Copy" from the drop-down menu.

5. In the "Copy Snapshot" dialog box, select the destination region where you want to copy the snapshot.

6. Under the "Encryption" section, select the "Encrypt this snapshot" checkbox.

7. Select the KMS key that you want to use for encryption from the drop-down menu.

8. Click on the "Copy Snapshot" button to create a new encrypted snapshot.

9. Once the new encrypted snapshot is created, you can delete the original unencrypted snapshot.

That's it! You have successfully enabled snapshot encryption for the selected snapshot in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Snapshot Encryption Feature Should Be Enabled" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to enable snapshot encryption feature for all the snapshots in the AWS account:

```
aws ec2 enable-snapshot-encryption
```

3. Wait for the command to complete. This may take some time depending on the number of snapshots in your account.

4. Verify that the snapshot encryption feature has been enabled by running the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --owner-ids self --query 'Snapshots[*].{ID:SnapshotId,Encrypted:Encrypted}'
```

This command will return a list of all the snapshots in your account and their encryption status. If the "Encrypted" field for all the snapshots is "true", then the snapshot encryption feature has been successfully enabled.

5. Repeat the above steps for all regions in your AWS account to ensure that snapshot encryption is enabled for all snapshots.

Note: Enabling snapshot encryption does not encrypt existing unencrypted snapshots. To encrypt existing unencrypted snapshots, you will need to copy them to a new encrypted snapshot using the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console.

#### Using Python

To remediate the snapshot encryption misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Install and configure the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) on your local machine.

Step 2: Create a Python script and import the necessary Boto3 libraries.

```
import boto3
```

Step 3: Create an EC2 client object using the Boto3 library.

```
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

Step 4: Get a list of all the snapshots in your AWS account using the `describe_snapshots` method.

```
snapshots = ec2.describe_snapshots(OwnerIds=['self'])['Snapshots']
```

Step 5: Loop through all the snapshots and check if they are encrypted or not using the `encrypted` attribute.

```
for snapshot in snapshots:
    if not snapshot['Encrypted']:
        snapshot_id = snapshot['SnapshotId']
        print(f"Snapshot {snapshot_id} is not encrypted.")
```

Step 6: If a snapshot is not encrypted, enable encryption using the `modify_snapshot_attribute` method.

```
ec2.modify_snapshot_attribute(
    SnapshotId=snapshot_id,
    Attribute='createVolumePermission',
    CreateVolumePermission={
        'Add': [
            {
                'UserId': 'self'
            }
        ]
    },
    DryRun=False
)
```

Step 7: Run the Python script to remediate the snapshot encryption misconfiguration.

Note: Make sure to test the script in a non-production environment before running it in a production environment.
