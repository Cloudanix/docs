How to enable snapshot encryption for RDS

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the RDS instance: Identify the specific RDS instance for which you want to enable snapshot encryption.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Snapshot Encryption Feature Should Be Enabled" Policy.)
2. Choose the encryption method: Amazon RDS supports two methods of snapshot encryption: AWS Key Management Service (KMS) encryption and default encryption.
   - KMS encryption: If you want to use KMS encryption, ensure that you have a KMS key created and available in your AWS account.
   - Default encryption: By default, RDS snapshots are encrypted with an AWS managed key, but you can also choose to use a customer master key (CMK) from KMS for additional control.
3. Enable snapshot encryption during RDS instance creation: If you are creating a new RDS instance, you can enable snapshot encryption during the instance creation process. In the AWS Management Console, specify the encryption options by selecting the appropriate KMS key or choosing the default encryption.
4. Enable snapshot encryption for an existing RDS instance:
   - KMS encryption: To enable KMS encryption for snapshots of an existing RDS instance, modify the instance and specify the appropriate KMS key in the AWS Management Console. Alternatively, you can use the ModifyDBInstance API or AWS CLI to update the instance and enable KMS encryption for snapshots.
   - Default encryption: To enable default encryption for snapshots of an existing RDS instance, modify the instance and choose the default encryption option in the AWS Management Console. You can also use the ModifyDBInstance API or AWS CLI to update the instance and enable default encryption for snapshots.
5. Verify snapshot encryption: After enabling snapshot encryption, verify that the snapshots taken for the RDS instance are encrypted. You can check the snapshot details in the AWS Management Console or use the DescribeDBSnapshots API or AWS CLI command to retrieve the snapshot information and confirm the encryption status.
