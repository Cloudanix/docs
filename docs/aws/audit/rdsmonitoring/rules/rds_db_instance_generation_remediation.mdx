### Remediation

How to ensure that RDB instances should use latest generation of instance classes

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the navigation panel, under RDS Dashboard, click Instances and select the RDS instance that you want to upgrade.

- Step 2: Click Instance Actions button from the dashboard top menu and select Modify.

- Step 3: On the Modify DB Instance: instance identifier page, under Instance Specifications section, select the previous generation instance type equivalent from the DB Instance Class dropdown list:
- Step 4: At the bottom, check Apply Immediately to apply the instance class change immediately.
  (!) IMPORTANT: when you upgrade (resize) the instance class (type), an immediate outage will occur. If the selected database instance is used in production consider leaving Apply Immediately option disabled before applying the changes in order to avoid any downtime. If Apply Immediately is not selected, the instance type upgrade will be processed during the next maintenance window.

- Step 5: Click Continue, Review the changes and click Modify DB Instance.
  During the upgrade process, the instance status should change from available to modifying and back to available (it may take few minutes depending on the instance configuration). Once the upgrade is complete, the instance type should be updated on the details page.
