1. Log in to your AWS console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon RDS dashboard.
3. Click on the "Reserved DB Instances" tab.
4. Identify the reserved instance with the status "Payment Pending".
5. Select the reserved instance by clicking on the checkbox next to it.
6. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Modify Reserved Instances".
7. In the "Modify Reserved Instances" window, select the "Immediate" option for the "Apply Immediately" field.
8. Click on the "Continue" button.
9. Review the changes and click on the "Modify Reserved Instances" button.
10. The status of the reserved instance should now be updated to "Active" or "Retired".

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "RDS Reserved Instances Should Not Have Status - Payment Pending" in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Reserved Instances Should Not Have Status - Payment Pending" in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AWS account and open the AWS CLI.

2. Run the following command to list all the RDS reserved instances in your account:

```
aws rds describe-reserved-db-instances
```

3. Identify the reserved instance(s) with the status "Payment Pending".

4. To remediate the issue, you can either wait for the payment to be processed or cancel the reserved instance and purchase a new one.

5. To cancel the reserved instance, run the following command:

```
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <instance-id> --no-multi-az --apply-immediately
```

Replace `<instance-id>` with the identifier of the reserved instance you want to cancel.

6. Once the instance is successfully modified, you can purchase a new reserved instance using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

Note: Cancelling a reserved instance may result in a loss of the upfront payment. Please check the AWS documentation for more information on cancelling RDS reserved instances.

#### Using Python

To remediate the RDS Reserved Instances with Payment Pending status in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules: boto3 and datetime.

```python
import boto3
import datetime
```

2. Create a boto3 client for RDS.

```python
rds = boto3.client('rds')
```

3. Get the list of all reserved instances.

```python
reserved_instances = rds.describe_reserved_db_instances()
```

4. Loop through the reserved instances and check if their status is PaymentPending.

```python
for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedDBInstances']:
    if reserved_instance['State'] == 'payment-pending':
```

5. If the status is PaymentPending, check if the payment is due today or has already passed.

```python
        payment_due_date = reserved_instance['StartTime'] + datetime.timedelta(days=1)
        if payment_due_date <= datetime.datetime.now():
```

6. If the payment is due today or has already passed, modify the reserved instance to change the payment status to active.

```python
            rds.modify_reserved_db_instances(
                ReservedDBInstanceId=reserved_instance['ReservedDBInstanceId'],
                ReservedDBInstancesOfferingId=reserved_instance['ReservedDBInstancesOfferingId'],
                DBInstanceCount=reserved_instance['DBInstanceCount'],
                ReservedDBInstanceClass=reserved_instance['DBInstanceClass'],
                MultiAZ=reserved_instance['MultiAZ'],
                OfferingType=reserved_instance['OfferingType'],
                Tags=reserved_instance['Tags'],
                ApplyImmediately=True
            )
```

7. Print a message indicating that the reserved instance has been modified.

```python
            print(f"Reserved instance {reserved_instance['ReservedDBInstanceId']} has been modified.")
```

The complete code to remediate RDS Reserved Instances with Payment Pending status in AWS using Python would look like this:

```python
import boto3
import datetime

rds = boto3.client('rds')

reserved_instances = rds.describe_reserved_db_instances()

for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedDBInstances']:
    if reserved_instance['State'] == 'payment-pending':
        payment_due_date = reserved_instance['StartTime'] + datetime.timedelta(days=1)
        if payment_due_date <= datetime.datetime.now():
            rds.modify_reserved_db_instances(
                ReservedDBInstanceId=reserved_instance['ReservedDBInstanceId'],
                ReservedDBInstancesOfferingId=reserved_instance['ReservedDBInstancesOfferingId'],
                DBInstanceCount=reserved_instance['DBInstanceCount'],
                ReservedDBInstanceClass=reserved_instance['DBInstanceClass'],
                MultiAZ=reserved_instance['MultiAZ'],
                OfferingType=reserved_instance['OfferingType'],
                Tags=reserved_instance['Tags'],
                ApplyImmediately=True
            )
            print(f"Reserved instance {reserved_instance['ReservedDBInstanceId']} has been modified.")
```
