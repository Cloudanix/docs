How to ensure RDS instances use latest generation instance classes

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the RDS instances: Identify the RDS instances for which you want to ensure the use of the latest generation instance classes.
   (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "RDS Instances Should Use Latest Generation of Instance Classes" Policy.)
2. Check the current instance classes: Determine the current instance classes of the RDS instances. You can do this by accessing the AWS Management Console, navigating to the RDS service, and viewing the details of each instance.
3. Review the latest generation instance classes: Stay informed about the latest generation instance classes available for your chosen database engine and region. AWS regularly introduces new instance classes with improved performance, capabilities, and cost-effectiveness.
4. Evaluate compatibility: Ensure that the latest generation instance classes are compatible with your database engine version, storage requirements, and any specific configuration needs of your application.
5. Plan the instance class upgrade: Create a plan to upgrade the instance classes of your RDS instances to the latest generation. Consider the impact on your application and any potential downtime during the upgrade process.
6. Perform the instance class upgrade: Execute the planned instance class upgrade for each RDS instance. This can be done through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.
7. Verify the changes: After the instance class upgrade, verify that the RDS instances are now using the latest generation instance classes. You can confirm this by checking the instance details in the RDS console or by running commands/API calls to retrieve the instance information programmatically.
