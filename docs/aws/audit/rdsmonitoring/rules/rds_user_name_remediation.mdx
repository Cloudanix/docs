### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the RDS dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, click on "Databases". This will display a list of all your RDS instances.
3. Click on the name of the RDS instance you want to check. This will open the instance details page.
4. In the "Configuration" section, look for the "Master username" field. If the same username is used for multiple RDS instances, then the Master Username is not unique.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all RDS instances: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the RDS instances in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,MasterUsername]' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all RDS instances along with their master usernames.

3. Check for unique master usernames: After you have the list of all RDS instances and their master usernames, you can check for uniqueness manually. This can be done by comparing the master usernames of all RDS instances. If you find any duplicate master usernames, it means that the master username is not unique.

4. Automate the process with a Python script: If you have a large number of RDS instances, checking for unique master usernames manually can be time-consuming. In this case, you can write a Python script that uses the AWS SDK (Boto3) to list all RDS instances and their master usernames, and then checks for uniqueness. Here is a simple example of how you can do this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a client for the AWS RDS service
   rds = boto3.client('rds')

   # Get a list of all RDS instances
   response = rds.describe_db_instances()

   # Extract the DB instance identifiers and master usernames
   db_info = [(db['DBInstanceIdentifier'], db['MasterUsername']) for db in response['DBInstances']]

   # Check for unique master usernames
   usernames = [info[1] for info in db_info]
   if len(usernames) != len(set(usernames)):
       print("Master username is not unique")
   else:
       print("Master username is unique")
   ```
   This script will print "Master username is not unique" if there are duplicate master usernames, and "Master username is unique" otherwise.

#### Using Python

1. Import the necessary libraries: You will need the boto3 library, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc.

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create a session using your AWS credentials. You can configure credentials in the AWS credentials profile file on your local system. The default location for the file is `~/.aws/credentials`.

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION_NAME'
)
```

3. Create a client for RDS and get all DB instances:

```python
rds = session.client('rds')
response = rds.describe_db_instances()
```

4. Iterate over all DB instances and check if the MasterUsername is unique:

```python
master_usernames = []
for instance in response['DBInstances']:
    master_username = instance['MasterUsername']
    if master_username in master_usernames:
        print(f"Master username {master_username} is not unique.")
    else:
        master_usernames.append(master_username)
```

This script will print a message for each MasterUsername that is not unique. If no messages are printed, then all MasterUsernames are unique.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of the master username not being unique for an AWS RDS instance, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and sign in using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to RDS Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page and select "RDS" under the Database section.

3. **Select the RDS Instance**: From the list of RDS instances, select the instance for which you want to change the master username.

4. **Modify the Master Username**: In the RDS dashboard, locate the "Configuration" section and click on the "Modify" button.

5. **Change the Master Username**: In the Modify DB Instance window, scroll down to the "Master Username" field and enter a unique username that you want to set as the new master username.

6. **Apply the Changes**: Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Continue" button.

7. **Review and Apply Changes**: Review the changes you are about to make and click on the "Modify DB Instance" button to apply the changes.

8. **Monitor the Modification**: The modification process may take a few minutes to complete. You can monitor the progress in the RDS console.

9. **Verify the Changes**: Once the modification is complete, verify that the master username has been successfully changed to a unique username.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of the master username not being unique for an AWS RDS instance using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of the master username not being unique for an AWS RDS instance using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the RDS Instance**: First, identify the RDS instance for which you need to change the master username. You can list all your RDS instances using the following AWS CLI command:
   ```bash
   aws rds describe-db-instances
   ```

2. **Modify the Master Username**: Once you have identified the RDS instance, you can modify the master username using the `modify-db-instance` command. Replace `your-db-instance-identifier` with the actual DB instance identifier and `new-master-username` with the unique username you want to set:
   ```bash
   aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier your-db-instance-identifier --master-user-password your-new-master-username
   ```

3. **Wait for the Modification to Complete**: The modification process may take some time to complete. You can check the status of the modification using the `describe-db-instances` command:
   ```bash
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier your-db-instance-identifier --query "DBInstances[*].DBInstanceStatus"
   ```

4. **Verify the Changes**: Once the modification is complete, verify that the master username has been successfully updated by describing the DB instance:
   ```bash
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier your-db-instance-identifier --query "DBInstances[*].MasterUsername"
   ```

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the issue of a non-unique master username for an AWS RDS instance using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of non-unique master username for an AWS RDS instance using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS services programmatically. Make sure you have the Boto3 library installed in your Python environment.

2. Write a Python script that does the following:
   
   a. Import the necessary libraries:
   ```python
   import boto3
   ```

   b. Initialize the RDS client:
   ```python
   rds_client = boto3.client('rds', region_name='your_region')
   ```

   c. List all existing RDS instances:
   ```python
   response = rds_client.describe_db_instances()
   ```

   d. Check if the master username is unique:
   ```python
   master_username = 'your_desired_master_username'
   existing_usernames = [instance['MasterUsername'] for instance in response['DBInstances']]
   
   if master_username in existing_usernames:
       print(f"Master username '{master_username}' is already in use. Please choose a different username.")
       # You can either prompt the user to enter a new unique username or generate a unique username programmatically
   else:
       print(f"Master username '{master_username}' is unique.")
   ```

3. Run the Python script to check if the master username is unique. If it's not unique, prompt the user to enter a new unique username or generate a unique username programmatically.

4. If the user enters a new unique username, update the master username for the RDS instance using the modify_db_instance method:
   ```python
   rds_client.modify_db_instance(
       DBInstanceIdentifier='your_db_instance_id',
       MasterUsername='your_new_master_username',
       ApplyImmediately=True
   )
   ```

5. Verify that the master username has been successfully updated by describing the RDS instance again and checking the master username.

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of a non-unique master username for an AWS RDS instance using Python.
