How to enable transport encryption for RDS

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the RDS instance: Identify the specific RDS instance for which you want to enable transport encryption.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Transport Encryption Feature Should Be Enabled" Policy.)
2. Choose the appropriate encryption method: Amazon RDS supports two methods of transport encryption: SSL/TLS and AWS Key Management Service (KMS) encryption.
   - SSL/TLS encryption: If you want to use SSL/TLS encryption, you can either choose the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to manage the SSL/TLS certificate or use a custom SSL/TLS certificate. If you choose ACM, make sure that you have a valid SSL/TLS certificate available in the AWS Certificate Manager.
   - KMS encryption: If you want to use KMS encryption, you need to ensure that you have a KMS key created and available in your AWS account.
3. Enable transport encryption during RDS instance creation: If you are creating a new RDS instance, you can enable transport encryption during the instance creation process. In the AWS Management Console, specify the encryption options by selecting the appropriate SSL/TLS certificate or KMS key.
4. Enable transport encryption for an existing RDS instance:
   - SSL/TLS encryption: To enable SSL/TLS encryption for an existing RDS instance, modify the instance and specify the appropriate SSL/TLS certificate in the AWS Management Console. Alternatively, you can use the ModifyDBInstance API or AWS CLI to update the instance and enable SSL/TLS encryption.
   - KMS encryption: To enable KMS encryption for an existing RDS instance, modify the instance and specify the appropriate KMS key in the AWS Management Console. You can also use the ModifyDBInstance API or AWS CLI to update the instance and enable KMS encryption.
5. Verify transport encryption: After enabling transport encryption, verify that the RDS instance is using the desired encryption method. You can check the instance details in the AWS Management Console or use the DescribeDBInstances API or AWS CLI command to retrieve the instance information and confirm the encryption settings.
