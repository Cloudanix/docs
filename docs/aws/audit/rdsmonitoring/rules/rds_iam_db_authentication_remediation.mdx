### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the IAM DB authentication misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the Amazon RDS console.
3. Select the RDS instance that you want to remediate the misconfiguration for.
4. Click on the "Modify" button in the "Instance actions" dropdown menu.
5. Scroll down to the "Database options" section.
6. Find the "IAM DB authentication" option and select "Yes".
7. Scroll down and click on the "Continue" button.
8. Review the changes and click on the "Modify DB instance" button.
9. Wait for the modification to complete.

Once the modification is complete, the IAM DB authentication feature will be enabled for the selected RDS instance, and you will have successfully remediated the misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

To remediate IAM DB authentication should be enabled for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and install the AWS CLI if you haven't already installed it.

2. Configure the AWS CLI with your AWS account credentials by running the following command:
```
aws configure
```
3. Once you have configured the AWS CLI, run the following command to enable IAM DB authentication:
```
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> --iam-database-authentication-enabled
```
Replace `<your-db-instance-identifier>` with the identifier of your RDS instance.

4. Verify that IAM DB authentication has been enabled by running the following command:
```
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> --query "DBInstances[*].IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled"
```
This command should return "true" if IAM DB authentication has been enabled successfully.

That's it. You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of IAM DB authentication not being enabled for your AWS RDS instance using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the IAM DB authentication misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using pip:

```
pip install boto3
```

2. Create a Boto3 client for Amazon RDS:

```
import boto3

client = boto3.client('rds')
```

3. List all the DB instances in your AWS account:

```
response = client.describe_db_instances()

for db_instance in response['DBInstances']:
    print(db_instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'])
```

4. For each DB instance, check if IAM DB authentication is enabled:

```
response = client.describe_db_instances(DBInstanceIdentifier='your-db-instance-id')

if response['DBInstances'][0]['IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled']:
    print('IAM DB authentication is already enabled.')
else:
    print('IAM DB authentication is not enabled.')
```

5. If IAM DB authentication is not enabled, enable it:

```
response = client.modify_db_instance(
    DBInstanceIdentifier='your-db-instance-id',
    IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled=True
)

print('IAM DB authentication has been enabled.')
```

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for all the DB instances in your AWS account.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to modify the DB instances in your AWS account.
