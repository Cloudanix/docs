### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Neptune Cluster snapshots not being encrypted in AWS RDS using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to the AWS Management Console using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to Amazon Neptune Console**: Once logged in, navigate to the Amazon Neptune console by typing "Neptune" in the search bar at the top of the console and selecting "Amazon Neptune" from the dropdown.

3. **Select your Neptune Cluster**: In the Amazon Neptune console, select the Neptune cluster for which you want to enable encryption for snapshots.

4. **Enable Encryption for Snapshots**:
   - Click on the Neptune cluster name to view its details.
   - In the left-hand navigation pane, click on "Snapshots".
   - Select the snapshot for which you want to enable encryption.
   - Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Modify Snapshot".
   - In the "Modify Snapshot" window, enable the option for "Encrypt snapshot" and select the appropriate KMS key for encryption.
   - Click on "Modify snapshot" to save the changes.

5. **Verify Encryption**:
   - Once the modification is complete, verify that the snapshot is now encrypted by checking the "Encrypted" column in the list of snapshots.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of Neptune Cluster snapshots not being encrypted in AWS RDS using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Neptune clusters snapshots not being encrypted in AWS RDS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **List all existing Neptune clusters in your AWS account**:
   Run the following AWS CLI command to list all existing Neptune clusters:
   ```
   aws neptune describe-db-clusters
   ```

2. **Enable encryption for Neptune cluster snapshots**:
   For each Neptune cluster that you identified in the previous step, you need to enable encryption for its snapshots. Run the following AWS CLI command for each cluster:
   ```
   aws neptune modify-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --storage-encrypted
   ```

   Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the actual identifier of the Neptune cluster you want to enable encryption for.

3. **Verify encryption status**:
   To verify that encryption has been enabled for the Neptune cluster snapshots, you can describe the cluster again and check the `StorageEncrypted` attribute. Run the following AWS CLI command:
   ```
   aws neptune describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier>
   ```

   Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the identifier of the Neptune cluster you modified.

4. **Repeat for all Neptune clusters**:
   Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each Neptune cluster in your AWS account to ensure that encryption is enabled for all cluster snapshots.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Neptune clusters snapshots not being encrypted in AWS RDS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Neptune Cluster snapshots not being encrypted in AWS, you can follow these steps using Python and AWS SDK (boto3):

1. Install the AWS SDK (boto3) if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

2. Write a Python script to enable encryption for Neptune Cluster snapshots:
```python
import boto3

def encrypt_neptune_snapshots():
    # Initialize the Neptune client
    client = boto3.client('neptune')

    # Get a list of all Neptune clusters
    clusters = client.describe_db_clusters()

    for cluster in clusters['DBClusters']:
        # Get the ARN of the cluster
        cluster_arn = cluster['DBClusterArn']
        
        # Enable encryption for snapshots of the cluster
        response = client.modify_db_cluster(
            DBClusterIdentifier=cluster_arn,
            BackupRetentionPeriod=7,  # Set the retention period for snapshots
            StorageEncrypted=True  # Enable encryption for snapshots
        )

        print(f"Encryption enabled for Neptune cluster snapshots: {cluster_arn}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    encrypt_neptune_snapshots()
```

3. Run the Python script to enable encryption for Neptune Cluster snapshots:
```bash
python encrypt_neptune_snapshots.py
```

This script will iterate through all Neptune clusters in your AWS account and enable encryption for their snapshots. Make sure to have the necessary IAM permissions to modify Neptune clusters.
