<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To ensure that Neptune Cluster Snapshots are encrypted in Amazon RDS using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Encrypted Snapshot**:
   When creating a snapshot, ensure that you specify the `--kms-key-id` parameter to encrypt the snapshot with a KMS key.

   ```sh
   aws rds create-db-cluster-snapshot \
       --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier my-cluster-snapshot \
       --db-cluster-identifier my-cluster \
       --kms-key-id arn:aws:kms:region:account-id:key/key-id
   ```

2. **Copy an Existing Snapshot with Encryption**:
   If you have an existing unencrypted snapshot, you can copy it and encrypt the new copy by specifying the `--kms-key-id` parameter.

   ```sh
   aws rds copy-db-cluster-snapshot \
       --source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier my-unencrypted-snapshot \
       --target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier my-encrypted-snapshot \
       --kms-key-id arn:aws:kms:region:account-id:key/key-id
   ```

3. **Modify DB Cluster to Enable Snapshot Encryption**:
   Ensure that the DB cluster is configured to use encryption for snapshots by modifying the cluster settings.

   ```sh
   aws rds modify-db-cluster \
       --db-cluster-identifier my-cluster \
       --storage-encrypted \
       --kms-key-id arn:aws:kms:region:account-id:key/key-id
   ```

4. **Automate Snapshot Creation with Encryption**:
   Use AWS CLI to create a scheduled task or Lambda function that automatically creates encrypted snapshots at regular intervals.

   ```sh
   aws events put-rule \
       --name my-snapshot-schedule \
       --schedule-expression "rate(24 hours)"

   aws lambda create-function \
       --function-name CreateEncryptedSnapshot \
       --runtime python3.8 \
       --role arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/lambda-execution-role \
       --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler \
       --zip-file fileb://function.zip

   aws lambda add-permission \
       --function-name CreateEncryptedSnapshot \
       --statement-id my-snapshot-schedule \
       --action 'lambda:InvokeFunction' \
       --principal events.amazonaws.com \
       --source-arn arn:aws:events:region:account-id:rule/my-snapshot-schedule

   aws events put-targets \
       --rule my-snapshot-schedule \
       --targets "Id"="1","Arn"="arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:CreateEncryptedSnapshot"
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Neptune Cluster Snapshots are encrypted, thereby enhancing the security of your data.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent Neptune Clusters Snapshots from being unencrypted in Amazon RDS using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps to ensure that your Neptune Cluster Snapshots are encrypted:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by setting environment variables:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. **Create a Python Script to Check and Enforce Encryption**:
   Write a Python script that will check if the Neptune Cluster Snapshots are encrypted and enforce encryption if they are not.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon RDS
   client = boto3.client('rds')

   # Function to check and enforce encryption on Neptune Cluster Snapshots
   def enforce_snapshot_encryption(cluster_identifier, kms_key_id):
       # Describe DB cluster snapshots
       response = client.describe_db_cluster_snapshots(
           DBClusterIdentifier=cluster_identifier
       )

       for snapshot in response['DBClusterSnapshots']:
           if not snapshot['StorageEncrypted']:
               print(f"Snapshot {snapshot['DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier']} is not encrypted. Encrypting now...")
               # Copy the snapshot with encryption
               client.copy_db_cluster_snapshot(
                   SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier=snapshot['DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier'],
                   TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier=snapshot['DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier'] + '-encrypted',
                   KmsKeyId=kms_key_id,
                   CopyTags=True
               )
               print(f"Snapshot {snapshot['DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier']} has been encrypted.")

   # Replace with your Neptune Cluster Identifier and KMS Key ID
   cluster_identifier = 'your-neptune-cluster-identifier'
   kms_key_id = 'your-kms-key-id'

   enforce_snapshot_encryption(cluster_identifier, kms_key_id)
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to ensure that all existing Neptune Cluster Snapshots are encrypted. You can set this script to run periodically using a cron job or AWS Lambda to ensure ongoing compliance.

   ```bash
   python enforce_snapshot_encryption.py
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Neptune Cluster Snapshots in Amazon RDS are always encrypted, thereby preventing any misconfigurations related to unencrypted snapshots.

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the RDS dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu and then selecting "RDS" under the "Database" category.
3. In the navigation pane on the left, click on "Snapshots". This will display a list of all the snapshots for your RDS instances.
4. For each snapshot, check the "Encryption" column. If the value is "Not Enabled" or "Disabled", then the Neptune Cluster snapshot is not encrypted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all Neptune Clusters: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the Neptune clusters in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-clusters --query 'DBClusters[*].[DBClusterIdentifier]' --output text
   ```

   This command will return a list of all Neptune cluster identifiers.

3. Check the encryption status of each Neptune Cluster: For each Neptune cluster, you need to check if it has encrypted snapshots. You can do this by running the following AWS CLI command:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-cluster-snapshots --db-cluster-identifier <DBClusterIdentifier> --query 'DBClusterSnapshots[*].[DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier,StorageEncrypted]' --output text
   ```

   Replace `<DBClusterIdentifier>` with the identifier of the Neptune cluster you want to check. This command will return a list of all snapshots for the specified Neptune cluster along with their encryption status. If the `StorageEncrypted` field is `false` for any snapshot, then that snapshot is not encrypted.

4. Automate the process with a script: If you have many Neptune clusters, it might be more efficient to automate the process with a Python script. You can use the `boto3` library to interact with AWS services. The script would iterate over all Neptune clusters and check the encryption status of their snapshots. If it finds any unencrypted snapshots, it could print a warning message or take some other action.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if Neptune Clusters Snapshots are encrypted in RDS using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to directly interact with AWS services, including Amazon RDS. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS:**

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

2. **Create a client for Amazon RDS:**

```python
rds = session.client('rds')
```

3. **Retrieve all DB snapshots and check their encryption status:**

```python
def check_encryption():
    snapshots = rds.describe_db_snapshots()['DBSnapshots']
    for snapshot in snapshots:
        if snapshot['Engine'] == 'neptune':
            if 'KmsKeyId' in snapshot:
                print(f"Snapshot {snapshot['DBSnapshotIdentifier']} is encrypted with KMS Key {snapshot['KmsKeyId']}")
            else:
                print(f"Snapshot {snapshot['DBSnapshotIdentifier']} is not encrypted")
```

4. **Call the function to start the check:**

```python
check_encryption()
```

This script will print out the encryption status of all Neptune cluster snapshots. If a snapshot is encrypted, it will also print out the ID of the KMS key used for encryption. If a snapshot is not encrypted, it will simply state that it is not encrypted.

Please replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'` and `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'` with your actual AWS access key and secret key. Also, you may need to change the `region_name` depending on where your resources are located.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of Neptune clusters snapshots not being encrypted in AWS RDS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **List all existing Neptune clusters in your AWS account**:
   Run the following AWS CLI command to list all existing Neptune clusters:
   ```
   aws neptune describe-db-clusters
   ```

2. **Enable encryption for Neptune cluster snapshots**:
   For each Neptune cluster that you identified in the previous step, you need to enable encryption for its snapshots. Run the following AWS CLI command for each cluster:
   ```
   aws neptune modify-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --storage-encrypted
   ```

   Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the actual identifier of the Neptune cluster you want to enable encryption for.

3. **Verify encryption status**:
   To verify that encryption has been enabled for the Neptune cluster snapshots, you can describe the cluster again and check the `StorageEncrypted` attribute. Run the following AWS CLI command:
   ```
   aws neptune describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier>
   ```

   Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the identifier of the Neptune cluster you modified.

4. **Repeat for all Neptune clusters**:
   Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each Neptune cluster in your AWS account to ensure that encryption is enabled for all cluster snapshots.
