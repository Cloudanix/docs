2. Navigate to the Amazon RDS service by selecting "RDS" from the services menu.
3. In the RDS dashboard, click on "Databases" in the left navigation pane.
4. Locate the RDS database instance(s) for which automated backups are not enabled.
5. Click on the checkbox next to the database instance(s) you want to remediate.
6. Above the list of database instances, click on the "Actions" button.
7. In the dropdown menu, select "Modify".
8. In the "Modify DB Instance" page, scroll down to the "Backup" section.
9. In the "Backup" section, locate the "Backup Retention Period" option.
10. Set a value for the backup retention period (e.g., 1-7 days or as per your organization's backup retention policy).
11. Scroll further down to the "Maintenance" section.
12. In the "Maintenance" section, ensure that the "Backup Window" is configured to allow sufficient time for backups without impacting database availability.
