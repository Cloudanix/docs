### Risk Level

High

### Address

Operational Maturity, Reliability, Security

### Compliance Standards

HIPAA, NIST, SOC2, HITRUST, AWSWAF, NISTCSF, PCIDSS

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Automated Backups Should Be Enabled" misconfiguration in AWS, please follow the below steps:

1. Login to your AWS console.
2. Go to the Amazon RDS service dashboard.
3. Select the RDS instance for which you want to enable automated backups.
4. Click on the "Modify" button in the top right corner of the page.
5. Scroll down to the "Backup" section.
6. Under the "Backup Retention Period" option, select a retention period that meets your business requirements. This will determine how long automated backups will be retained.
7. Under the "Backup Window" option, select a time window during which automated backups will be taken. This should be a time when your application is least active to minimize impact.
8. Under the "Backup" section, select the "Enable automatic backups" option.
9. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Modify DB Instance" button to save the changes.

Once these steps are completed, automated backups will be enabled for the selected RDS instance.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Automated Backups Should Be Enabled" for AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to enable automated backups for all RDS instances in the region:

```
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <DBInstanceIdentifier> --backup-retention-period <RetentionPeriod> --apply-immediately
```

Replace `<DBInstanceIdentifier>` with the identifier of the RDS instance for which you want to enable automated backups and `<RetentionPeriod>` with the number of days you want to retain the automated backups.

3. Verify that automated backups have been enabled for the RDS instance by running the following command:

```
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <DBInstanceIdentifier> --query 'DBInstances[*].BackupRetentionPeriod'
```

This command should return the retention period that you set in step 2.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all RDS instances in the region to ensure that automated backups are enabled for all instances.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Automated Backups Should Be Enabled" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Automated Backups Should Be Enabled" in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Import the necessary Python libraries boto3 and datetime.

```
import boto3
import datetime
```

Step 2: Create a session using the access key and secret key of the AWS account.

```
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='SECRET_KEY'
)
```

Step 3: Create an EC2 client using the session.

```
ec2_client = session.client('ec2')
```

Step 4: Get the list of instances in the AWS account.

```
instances = ec2_client.describe_instances()
```

Step 5: Loop through the instances and check if automated backups are enabled.

```
for reservation in instances['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
        instance_name = ''
        for tag in instance['Tags']:
            if tag['Key'] == 'Name':
                instance_name = tag['Value']
        if 'BlockDeviceMappings' in instance:
            for device in instance['BlockDeviceMappings']:
                if 'Ebs' in device:
                    volume_id = device['Ebs']['VolumeId']
                    response = ec2_client.describe_volumes(
                        VolumeIds=[volume_id]
                    )
                    if 'SnapshotId' in response['Volumes'][0]:
                        snapshot_id = response['Volumes'][0]['SnapshotId']
                        snapshot_response = ec2_client.describe_snapshots(
                            SnapshotIds=[snapshot_id]
                        )
                        snapshot_start_time = snapshot_response['Snapshots'][0]['StartTime']
                        snapshot_age = (datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc) - snapshot_start_time).days
                        if snapshot_age > 7:
                            print(f"Instance {instance_name} ({instance_id}) has an EBS volume {volume_id} with an outdated snapshot {snapshot_id} ({snapshot_age} days old).")
                    else:
                        print(f"Instance {instance_name} ({instance_id}) has an EBS volume {volume_id} with no snapshot.")
                else:
                    print(f"Instance {instance_name} ({instance_id}) has a non-EBS volume {device['DeviceName']}.")
        else:
            print(f"Instance {instance_name} ({instance_id}) has no volumes.")
```

Step 6: If automated backups are not enabled, enable them using the following command.

```
ec2_client.modify_instance_attribute(
    InstanceId=instance_id,
    BlockDeviceMappings=[
        {
            'DeviceName': '/dev/xvda',
            'Ebs': {
                'DeleteOnTermination': True,
                'VolumeType': 'gp2',
                'Encrypted': True
            }
        }
    ]
)
```

Note: The above command enables automated backups for the root volume of the instance. You can modify the command to enable backups for other volumes as well.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Automated Backups Should Be Enabled" in AWS using Python.
