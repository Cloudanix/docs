### Remediation

How to Ensure that no AWS RDS DB instances are provisioned inside VPC public subnets?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Amazon RDS service by selecting "RDS" from the services menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "RDS DB Instances Should Not Be Provisioned in VPC Public Subnets" Policy.)
3. In the RDS dashboard, click on "Databases" in the left navigation pane.
4. Identify the RDS database instances that are in a public subnet and need to be remediated.
5. Select the checkbox next to the database instance(s) you want to remediate.
6. Above the list of database instances, click on the "Actions" button.
7. In the dropdown menu, select "Modify".
8. In the "Modify DB Instance" page, scroll down to the "Network & Security" section.
9. In the "Network & Security" section, locate the "Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)" option.
10. Click on the "Edit" button next to the VPC setting.
11. In the "Edit VPC" window, choose the VPC and subnet(s) that you want to use for the RDS database instance.
   Note: Select a private subnet that is not accessible directly from the internet.
12. Click on the "Save" button to apply the VPC and subnet changes.
13. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Modify DB Instance" button to save the changes.
14. The modification process may take some time to complete, during which the database might experience a brief interruption or slowdown.
15. Once the modification is finished, the RDS database instance will be moved to the selected private subnet, effectively removing its public accessibility.
16. Repeat these steps for any other RDS database instances that are in public subnets and need to be remediated.
17. After the modification is complete, verify that the RDS database instances are now located in private subnets and are not publicly accessible.
