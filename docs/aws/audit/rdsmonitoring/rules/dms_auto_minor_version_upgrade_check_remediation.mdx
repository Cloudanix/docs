To prevent DMS (Database Migration Service) Automatic Minor Version Upgrades in RDS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Describe the current RDS instances to identify the ones with Automatic Minor Version Upgrades enabled:**
   ```sh
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].{DBInstanceIdentifier:DBInstanceIdentifier,AutoMinorVersionUpgrade:AutoMinorVersionUpgrade}'
   ```

2. **Modify the RDS instance to disable Automatic Minor Version Upgrades:**
   ```sh
   aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade
   ```

3. **Apply the changes immediately (if required):**
   ```sh
   aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade --apply-immediately
   ```

4. **Verify the changes to ensure Automatic Minor Version Upgrades are disabled:**
   ```sh
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier> --query 'DBInstances[*].AutoMinorVersionUpgrade'
   ```

Replace `<your-db-instance-identifier>` with the actual identifier of your RDS instance. These steps will help you prevent Automatic Minor Version Upgrades for your RDS instances using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent DMS (Database Migration Service) Automatic Minor Version Upgrades from being enabled in RDS using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by creating a `~/.aws/credentials` file.

3. **Create a Python Script**:
   Write a Python script to modify the RDS instance settings to disable automatic minor version upgrades.

4. **Execute the Script**:
   Run the script to apply the changes.

Here is a sample Python script to disable automatic minor version upgrades for an RDS instance:

```python
import boto3

def disable_automatic_minor_version_upgrade(instance_identifier):
    # Create a session using your AWS credentials
    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id='YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
        region_name='YOUR_AWS_REGION'
    )

    # Create an RDS client
    rds_client = session.client('rds')

    try:
        # Modify the RDS instance to disable automatic minor version upgrades
        response = rds_client.modify_db_instance(
            DBInstanceIdentifier=instance_identifier,
            AutoMinorVersionUpgrade=False,
            ApplyImmediately=True  # Apply the changes immediately
        )
        print(f"Successfully disabled automatic minor version upgrades for instance: {instance_identifier}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error disabling automatic minor version upgrades: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace 'your-db-instance-identifier' with your actual RDS instance identifier
    instance_identifier = 'your-db-instance-identifier'
    disable_automatic_minor_version_upgrade(instance_identifier)
```

### Steps Explanation:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   - Ensure Boto3 is installed to interact with AWS services.

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   - Configure your AWS credentials to authenticate your requests.

3. **Create a Python Script**:
   - The script initializes a Boto3 session and creates an RDS client.
   - It then calls the `modify_db_instance` method to set `AutoMinorVersionUpgrade` to `False`.

4. **Execute the Script**:
   - Run the script with the appropriate RDS instance identifier to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you can prevent DMS Automatic Minor Version Upgrades from being enabled in your RDS instances using a Python script.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Databases".

3. Choose the name of the DB instance that you want to check.

4. In the "Details" section, look for the "Maintenance & backups" section.

5. Under "Maintenance", check the "Auto minor version upgrade" field. If it is set to "Yes", then automatic minor version upgrades are enabled. If it is set to "No", then they are not enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all RDS instances: Use the following command to list all the RDS instances in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier]' --output text
   ```
   This command will return a list of all RDS instance identifiers.

3. Check DMS Automatic Minor Version Upgrades setting: For each RDS instance, you can check the DMS Automatic Minor Version Upgrades setting by using the following command:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <DBInstanceIdentifier> --query 'DBInstances[*].[AutoMinorVersionUpgrade]' --output text
   ```
   Replace `<DBInstanceIdentifier>` with the identifier of the RDS instance you want to check. This command will return `true` if DMS Automatic Minor Version Upgrades is enabled, and `false` otherwise.

4. Repeat step 3 for each RDS instance: You need to repeat step 3 for each RDS instance in your AWS account. If any instance returns `false`, it means that DMS Automatic Minor Version Upgrades is not enabled for that instance.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if DMS Automatic Minor Version Upgrades are enabled in RDS using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to directly interact with AWS services, including RDS. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the Boto3 library in Python:**
   Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using pip:
   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set up AWS Credentials and Region for Boto3:**
   You need to set up your AWS credentials and the AWS region where your RDS instances are located. You can do this in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
   Then input your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

3. **Create a Python script to interact with RDS:**
   Use the Boto3 library to create an RDS client, then use the `describe_db_instances` method to get information about your RDS instances. Here's a basic script that prints out whether each RDS instance has automatic minor version upgrades enabled:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create an RDS client
   rds = boto3.client('rds')

   # Get information about all RDS instances
   response = rds.describe_db_instances()

   # Loop through each RDS instance and print whether it has automatic minor version upgrades enabled
   for instance in response['DBInstances']:
       print(f"DB instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']}: Auto minor version upgrade = {instance['AutoMinorVersionUpgrade']}")
   ```

4. **Run the Python script:**
   Save your script and run it using a Python interpreter. The script will print out whether each RDS instance has automatic minor version upgrades enabled. If the output is `True`, then automatic minor version upgrades are enabled. If the output is `False`, then they are not enabled.

Remember to replace 'rds' with the appropriate AWS service client if you're checking for a different service.
