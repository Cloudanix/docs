How to check if RDS RIs are having A Corresponding DB Instances?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify Reserved DB Instances:
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "RDS RIs Should Have A Corresponding DB Instances" Policy.)
   - Open the Amazon RDS console and navigate to the "Reserved Instances" page.
   - Review the list of reserved DB instances to identify the instances that are not currently in use.
2. Determine Utilization:
   - Identify the running DB instances associated with each reserved instance.
   - Compare the utilization of the running instances with the capacity provided by the reserved instances.
3. Verify Usage:
   - Check the activity and workload patterns of the running instances associated with the reserved instances.
   - Ensure that the instances are actively used and are not underutilized or unnecessary for the workload.
4. Evaluate Cost Savings:
   - Calculate the potential cost savings by comparing the hourly rate of the reserved instances with the cost of running instances on an on-demand basis.
   - Consider the remaining term of the reserved instances and the expected usage during that period.
5. Modify or Sell Reserved Instances:
   - If you find unused or underutilized reserved instances:
     - Modify the reserved instance attributes to match the running instances' specifications, such as DB instance class, Multi-AZ, etc.
     - Sell the unused reserved instances on the Reserved Instance Marketplace if applicable.
