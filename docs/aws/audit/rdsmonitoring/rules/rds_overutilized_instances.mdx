How to identify overutilized RDS DB instances and upgrade them?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Monitor RDS performance metrics: Start by monitoring the performance metrics of your RDS DB instances. Key metrics to consider are CPU utilization, memory utilization, storage usage, and I/O activity. These metrics can be obtained from the Amazon CloudWatch console or through the CloudWatch APIs.
2. Set utilization thresholds: Determine the thresholds for each performance metric that indicate overutilization. These thresholds can vary based on your application's requirements and performance expectations. For example, you may consider a CPU utilization threshold of 80% as an indicator of overutilization.
3. Identify overutilized instances: Analyze the performance metrics and compare them against the utilization thresholds you set. Identify the DB instances that consistently exceed the thresholds for an extended period. These instances are likely candidates for being overutilized.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "RDS Instances Should Not Be Overutilized" Policy.)
4. Evaluate workload patterns: Consider the workload patterns of your application. Some applications may experience periodic spikes in resource usage, which may not require an immediate upgrade. Look for consistent and sustained overutilization patterns to prioritize the instances that need immediate attention.
5. Review instance specifications: Review the specifications of the identified overutilized instances, including the instance class, storage capacity, and provisioned IOPS (if applicable). Compare them with the performance requirements and workload demands of your application.
6. Select an appropriate upgrade option: Based on the evaluation of the instance specifications and workload demands, choose an appropriate upgrade option. This may involve upgrading to a higher instance class, increasing storage capacity, or provisioning more IOPS.
7. Plan the instance upgrade: Plan the instance upgrade carefully to minimize downtime and ensure data integrity. Consider utilizing Multi-AZ deployments or read replicas to facilitate a smooth upgrade process.
8. Perform the instance upgrade: Follow the AWS documentation and guidelines to perform the instance upgrade. This typically involves modifying the DB instance settings to reflect the desired specifications and initiating the upgrade process. The upgrade process may involve a reboot or failover for Multi-AZ deployments.
9. Monitor and validate: After the instance upgrade, closely monitor the performance metrics to ensure that the overutilization has been resolved. Validate the improved performance and assess the impact on your application's stability and responsiveness.
