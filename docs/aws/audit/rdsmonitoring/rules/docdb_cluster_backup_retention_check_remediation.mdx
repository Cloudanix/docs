1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Databases".

3. In the list of DB instances, choose the name of the DocumentDB instance that you want to check.

4. In the "Details" section, look for the "Backup" section. Here, you can see the "Backup Retention Period" setting. This setting indicates the number of days that Amazon RDS will retain automatic backups of your DB instance.

5. If the "Backup Retention Period" is set to 0, it means that the backup retention is disabled for the selected DocumentDB cluster.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by following the instructions provided in the AWS CLI User Guide.

2. List all DocumentDB clusters: Use the `describe-db-clusters` command to list all the DocumentDB clusters in your AWS account. The command should look like this:

   ```
   aws docdb describe-db-clusters --region your-region-name
   ```

   Replace `your-region-name` with the name of the AWS region where your DocumentDB clusters are located.

3. Check backup retention period: The output of the `describe-db-clusters` command includes a `BackupRetentionPeriod` field for each DocumentDB cluster. This field indicates the number of days for which automated backups are retained. 

   You can use the `jq` command-line tool to filter the output and display only the `DBClusterIdentifier` and `BackupRetentionPeriod` fields:

   ```
   aws docdb describe-db-clusters --region your-region-name | jq -r '.DBClusters[] | {DBClusterIdentifier: .DBClusterIdentifier, BackupRetentionPeriod: .BackupRetentionPeriod}'
   ```

4. Analyze the output: Go through the output and check the `BackupRetentionPeriod` for each DocumentDB cluster. If the `BackupRetentionPeriod` is less than the desired number of days, then the DocumentDB cluster is misconfigured.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Now, create a client for 'rds' service:

```python
rds = session.client('rds')
```

4. Now, you can list all the DocumentDB clusters and check their backup retention period. If the backup retention period is less than 7 days, print a warning message:

```python
clusters = rds.describe_db_clusters()

for cluster in clusters['DBClusters']:
    if cluster['BackupRetentionPeriod'] < 7:
        print(f"Warning: The backup retention period for the cluster {cluster['DBClusterIdentifier']} is less than 7 days.")
```

This script will check all your DocumentDB clusters in the 'us-west-2' region. If you have clusters in other regions, you need to create a session for each of those regions and repeat the process.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of missing backup retention settings for an AWS RDS DocumentDB cluster, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and login with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to RDS Service**: From the AWS Management Console, navigate to the RDS service by clicking on the "Services" dropdown in the top left corner and selecting "RDS" under the Database category.

3. **Select DocumentDB Cluster**: In the RDS dashboard, locate and select the DocumentDB cluster for which you want to configure backup retention settings.

4. **Modify Cluster**: Click on the cluster identifier to view the cluster details. Then, click on the "Modify" button at the top to edit the cluster settings.

5. **Configure Backup Retention**: Scroll down to the "Backup" section of the modification page. Here, you can set the backup retention period by specifying the number of days you want to retain automated backups for the cluster.

6. **Enable Automated Backups**: Ensure that the "Backup Retention Period" is set to a value greater than 0 to enable automated backups for the cluster. You can choose a retention period based on your backup and recovery requirements.

7. **Save Changes**: After setting the desired backup retention period, scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the "Continue" button. Review the summary of changes and click on the "Modify Cluster" button to apply the new backup retention settings.

8. **Verify Configuration**: Once the modification is complete, go back to the cluster details page and verify that the backup retention period is set correctly. You should see a confirmation that the backup retention settings have been updated successfully.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of missing backup retention settings for an AWS RDS DocumentDB cluster using the AWS Management Console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of a Document DB Cluster not having backup retention check in AWS RDS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Document DB Cluster**: First, you need to identify the Document DB Cluster for which you want to enable backup retention.

2. **Enable Backup Retention**: Run the following AWS CLI command to modify the Document DB Cluster to enable backup retention with the desired retention period (in days). Replace `<cluster-identifier>` with the actual identifier of your Document DB Cluster and `<retention-period>` with the desired backup retention period.

```bash
aws rds modify-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier> --backup-retention-period <retention-period>
```

3. **Verify Backup Retention**: To verify that the backup retention has been successfully enabled, you can describe the Document DB Cluster using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier>
```

4. **Check Backup Retention Settings**: Ensure that the backup retention period is set to the desired value in the output of the above command.

By following these steps and executing the provided AWS CLI commands, you can remediate the misconfiguration of a Document DB Cluster not having backup retention check in AWS RDS.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of missing backup retention settings for an AWS RDS DocumentDB cluster using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update the backup retention period.

Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this issue:

1. Install Boto3:
   If you haven't already installed the Boto3 library, you can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Create a Python script to update the backup retention period:
   You can create a Python script with the following code snippet to update the backup retention period for the DocumentDB cluster:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Define the AWS region and DocumentDB cluster identifier
   region = 'your_aws_region'
   cluster_identifier = 'your_documentdb_cluster_identifier'

   # Define the new backup retention period in days
   new_retention_period = 7

   # Create a DocumentDB client
   client = boto3.client('docdb', region_name=region)

   # Update the backup retention period for the DocumentDB cluster
   response = client.modify_db_cluster(
       DBClusterIdentifier=cluster_identifier,
       BackupRetentionPeriod=new_retention_period
   )

   print("Backup retention period updated successfully to {} days.".format(new_retention_period))
   ```

3. Configure AWS credentials:
   Ensure that your AWS credentials are properly configured on the machine where you will run this script. You can set up your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or environment variables.

4. Run the Python script:
   Save the Python script with the above code snippet and run it. This script will update the backup retention period for the specified DocumentDB cluster to the desired value (in this case, 7 days).

By following these steps and running the Python script, you can remediate the misconfiguration of missing backup retention settings for an AWS RDS DocumentDB cluster.
