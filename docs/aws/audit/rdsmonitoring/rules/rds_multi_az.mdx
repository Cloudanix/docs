How to enable Multi-AZ deployment for RDS clusters

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the target RDS cluster:
   - Go to the Amazon RDS console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/).
   - Select the RDS cluster for which you want to enable Multi-AZ deployment.
     (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Multi-AZ Deployment Should Be Used" Policy.)
2. Check the existing deployment configuration:
   - In the "Details" section of the RDS cluster, locate the "Deployment" information.
   - Note down the current deployment configuration, which will indicate whether Multi-AZ is already enabled or not.
3. Modify the cluster to enable Multi-AZ:
   - Select the RDS cluster and click on the "Actions" button.
   - Choose "Modify" from the dropdown menu to modify the cluster's configuration.
   - In the "Modify DB Cluster" wizard, go to the "Availability & durability" section.
   - Enable the "Multi-AZ deployment" option.
   - Review and adjust other configuration settings as needed.
   - Click on the "Modify cluster" button to apply the changes.
4. Monitor the modification process:
   - After initiating the modification, the RDS cluster will undergo a brief maintenance window to enable Multi-AZ deployment.
   - Monitor the progress of the modification in the RDS console.
   - Once the modification is complete, the cluster will be Multi-AZ enabled.
5. Verify the Multi-AZ deployment:
   - In the RDS console, check the "Details" section of the RDS cluster to confirm that Multi-AZ is now enabled.
   - Look for the "Availability & durability" information, which should indicate that the cluster is deployed across multiple Availability Zones.
6. Test failover and verify functionality:
   - Multi-AZ deployment provides high availability by automatically failing over to the standby replica in the event of a primary instance failure.
   - Test the failover mechanism by initiating a failover manually or by simulating a failure scenario.
   - Monitor the failover process and ensure that the cluster switches to the standby replica seamlessly.
   - After failover, verify that your applications can still connect to the RDS cluster and operate normally.
