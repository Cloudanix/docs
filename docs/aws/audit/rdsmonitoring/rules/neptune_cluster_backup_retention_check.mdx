### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Neptune DB Cluster not having backup retention check in AWS RDS using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and login using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to Amazon Neptune**: Click on the "Services" dropdown in the top menu, then select "Neptune" under the Database section.

3. **Select Neptune DB Cluster**: From the list of Neptune DB Clusters, click on the DB Cluster that you want to configure backup retention for.

4. **Modify Backup Retention**: In the Neptune DB Cluster dashboard, click on the "Modify" button to change the configuration settings.

5. **Set Backup Retention Period**: Scroll down to the "Backup" section and locate the "Backup Retention Period" setting. Set the desired backup retention period in days. Ensure that the checkbox for "Backup Retention" is checked.

6. **Apply Changes**: Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the "Continue" button.

7. **Review and Apply Changes**: Review the changes you have made to the Neptune DB Cluster configuration. Once you are satisfied, click on the "Modify Cluster" button to apply the changes.

8. **Monitor Configuration Changes**: After applying the changes, monitor the Neptune DB Cluster to ensure that the backup retention check is configured correctly.

By following these steps, you will successfully remediate the misconfiguration of Neptune DB Cluster not having backup retention check in AWS RDS using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration for Neptune DB Cluster backup retention check in AWS RDS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Check Current Backup Retention Settings**:
   Run the following AWS CLI command to check the current backup retention settings for your Neptune DB Cluster:
   ```
   aws neptune describe-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier YOUR_DB_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER
   ```

2. **Update Backup Retention Period**:
   Run the following AWS CLI command to modify the backup retention period for your Neptune DB Cluster. Replace `YOUR_DB_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER` with the actual identifier of your Neptune DB Cluster and `NEW_RETENTION_PERIOD` with the desired retention period in days:
   ```
   aws neptune modify-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier YOUR_DB_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER --backup-retention-period NEW_RETENTION_PERIOD
   ```

3. **Verify Backup Retention Settings**:
   Run the following AWS CLI command to verify that the backup retention period has been updated successfully:
   ```
   aws neptune describe-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier YOUR_DB_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER
   ```

4. **Enable Automated Backups** (if not already enabled):
   If automated backups are not already enabled for your Neptune DB Cluster, you can enable them using the following AWS CLI command:
   ```
   aws neptune modify-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier YOUR_DB_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER --backup-retention-period NEW_RETENTION_PERIOD --backup-restore-window BACKUP_RESTORE_WINDOW --preferred-backup-window PREFERRED_BACKUP_WINDOW --enable-iam-database-authentication
   ```

5. **Monitor Backup Retention**:
   Regularly monitor the backup retention settings for your Neptune DB Cluster to ensure that the configured retention period meets your data protection and compliance requirements.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration for Neptune DB Cluster backup retention check in AWS RDS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Neptune DB Cluster not having backup retention check for AWS RDS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Create a Python script with the following code to enable backup retention for your Neptune DB Cluster:

```python
import boto3

# Define the AWS region where your Neptune DB Cluster is located
region = 'your_region'

# Define the name of your Neptune DB Cluster
cluster_identifier = 'your_neptune_cluster_identifier'

# Create a Neptune client
client = boto3.client('neptune', region_name=region)

# Enable backup retention for the Neptune DB Cluster
response = client.modify_db_cluster(
    DBClusterIdentifier=cluster_identifier,
    BackupRetentionPeriod=7  # Specify the number of days to retain backups
)

print("Backup retention enabled for Neptune DB Cluster: {}".format(cluster_identifier))
```

3. Replace `'your_region'` with the AWS region where your Neptune DB Cluster is located and `'your_neptune_cluster_identifier'` with the actual name of your Neptune DB Cluster.

4. Run the Python script. After successful execution, the backup retention period for your Neptune DB Cluster will be set to the specified number of days (in this case, 7 days).

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Neptune DB Cluster not having backup retention check for AWS RDS using Python.
