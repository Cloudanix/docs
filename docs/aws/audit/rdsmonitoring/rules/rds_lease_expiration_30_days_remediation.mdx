### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Renew RDS Reserved Instances Before Expiration (30 days) in AWS using AWS console, please follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Click on the "RDS" service from the list of services.
3. Select the "Reserved Instances" option from the left-hand menu.
4. In the "Reserved Instances" page, you will see a list of all your reserved instances.
5. Check the expiration date of each reserved instance to see if any are expiring within the next 30 days.
6. Select the reserved instance that is expiring within the next 30 days.
7. Click on the "Modify Reserved Instances" button.
8. In the "Modify Reserved Instances" page, select the "Renewal" tab.
9. Choose the number of months you want to renew the reserved instance for.
10. Click on the "Purchase" button to renew the reserved instance.

Once you have completed these steps, your RDS Reserved Instance will be renewed before its expiration date.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Renew RDS Reserved Instances Before Expiration (30 days)" for AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, identify which RDS Reserved Instances are going to expire in the next 30 days. You can use the following AWS CLI command to get the list of RDS Reserved Instances that are going to expire in the next 30 days:

```
aws rds describe-reserved-db-instances --filters "Name=state,Values=active" "Name=expiration,Values=$(date -d '+30 days' --utc +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S)"
```

This command will return a list of RDS Reserved Instances that are going to expire in the next 30 days.

2. Once you have identified the RDS Reserved Instances that are going to expire, you can renew them using the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws rds purchase-reserved-db-instances-offering --reserved-db-instances-offering-id <offering-id> --reserved-db-instances-quantity <quantity> --tags Key=<key>,Value=<value>
```

Replace `<offering-id>` with the ID of the Reserved Instances offering that you want to renew, `<quantity>` with the number of instances you want to renew, and `<key>` and `<value>` with the tag key and value that you want to add to the renewed instances.

3. After renewing the RDS Reserved Instances, you can verify that they have been renewed by running the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws rds describe-reserved-db-instances --filters "Name=state,Values=active" "Name=expiration,Values=$(date -d '+30 days' --utc +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S)"
```

This command will return a list of RDS Reserved Instances that are active and have an expiration date that is 30 days or more in the future.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Renew RDS Reserved Instances Before Expiration (30 days)" for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of renewing RDS Reserved Instances before expiration (30 days) in AWS using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using the following command:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Create an AWS client session using the following code:
   ```
   import boto3
   
   session = boto3.Session(
       region_name='<region_name>',
       aws_access_key_id='<aws_access_key_id>',
       aws_secret_access_key='<aws_secret_access_key>'
   )
   
   rds_client = session.client('rds')
   ```

3. Get a list of all the RDS Reserved Instances using the following code:
   ```
   reserved_instances = rds_client.describe_reserved_db_instances()
   ```

4. Loop through the reserved instances and check if any of them are expiring within the next 30 days using the following code:
   ```
   import datetime
   
   for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedDBInstances']:
       expiration_time = reserved_instance['StartTime'] + datetime.timedelta(days=reserved_instance['Duration'])
       time_to_expiry = expiration_time - datetime.datetime.now(expiration_time.tzinfo)
       if time_to_expiry.days <= 30:
           # Renew the reserved instance
           rds_client.modify_reserved_db_instances(
               ReservedDBInstanceId=reserved_instance['ReservedDBInstanceId'],
               ReservedDBInstancesOfferingId=reserved_instance['ReservedDBInstancesOfferingId'],
               DBInstanceCount=reserved_instance['DBInstanceCount']
           )
   ```

5. Schedule the script to run periodically (e.g. every day) using a tool like AWS Lambda or cron job.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of renewing RDS Reserved Instances before expiration (30 days) in AWS using Python.
