How to enable IAM DB authentication for RDS

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the RDS instance: Identify the specific RDS instance for which you want to enable IAM DB authentication.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "IAM DB authentication Should Be Enabled" Policy.)
2. Enable IAM DB authentication during instance creation: If you are creating a new RDS instance, you can enable IAM DB authentication during the instance creation process. In the AWS Management Console, under the "Additional Configuration" section, select the checkbox for "Enable IAM DB authentication."
3. Enable IAM DB authentication for an existing RDS instance:
   - AWS Management Console: To enable IAM DB authentication for an existing RDS instance, navigate to the RDS console, select the instance, and click on the "Modify" button. In the "Additional Configuration" section, select the checkbox for "Enable IAM DB authentication." Click "Continue" and follow the prompts to apply the changes.
   - AWS CLI: Use the `modify-db-instance` command to enable IAM DB authentication for an existing RDS instance. Specify the `--enable-iam-database-authentication` flag and provide the instance identifier. Example command: 
     ```
     aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <instance-identifier> --enable-iam-database-authentication
     ```
   - AWS SDKs/API: Use the appropriate API call or SDK method to modify the RDS instance and enable IAM DB authentication. Refer to the documentation specific to your chosen programming language or AWS SDK for implementation details.
4. Verify IAM DB authentication: After enabling IAM DB authentication, you can verify its status by connecting to the RDS instance using an IAM user or IAM role. Attempt to authenticate using the IAM credentials and check if the connection is successful. IAM DB authentication allows users and applications to use IAM credentials to connect to the RDS instance instead of providing a separate database username and password.
