How to ensure all database instances in Amazon Aurora clusters have same accessibility

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the Amazon Aurora cluster: Identify the cluster for which you want to ensure consistent accessibility across its database instances.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Accessibility Should Be Well-defined in Aurora Clusters" Policy.)
2. Verify the current accessibility configuration: Determine the current accessibility configuration of the database instances within the cluster. Check if they have the same accessibility settings or if there are inconsistencies.
3. Update the accessibility settings: Decide on the desired accessibility configuration for the cluster. You can choose to make all the database instances publicly accessible or private based on your requirements.
   - For Public Accessibility: If you want all the database instances to be publicly accessible, ensure that the cluster's security group allows inbound access from the desired IP ranges or sources.   
   - For Private Accessibility: If you want to restrict the accessibility to private networks, ensure that the cluster's security group only allows inbound access from the desired private IP ranges or specific security groups.
4. Apply the changes: Make the necessary updates to the cluster's accessibility settings. This may involve modifying the security group rules associated with the cluster.
5. Verify the changes: Once the changes are applied, verify that all the database instances within the Amazon Aurora cluster have the same accessibility configuration.
   - For Public Accessibility: Confirm that all the database instances are accessible from the specified IP ranges or sources.  
   - For Private Accessibility: Confirm that the database instances can only be accessed from the specified private IP ranges or specific security groups.
