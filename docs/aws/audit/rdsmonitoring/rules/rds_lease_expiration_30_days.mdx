### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the RDS dashboard. 

2. In the navigation pane, click on 'Reserved Instances'. This will display a list of all your reserved instances.

3. For each reserved instance, check the 'State' and 'End date'. If the state is 'active' and the end date is within the next 30 days, then the reserved instance is due for renewal.

4. You can also use the 'Filter' option to filter out the instances that are due for renewal. Enter the end date range as the next 30 days to get a list of all instances that need to be renewed.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```

   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all RDS Reserved Instances: Use the `describe-reserved-db-instances` command to list all your RDS Reserved Instances. This command returns a JSON object that contains all your reserved instances.

   ```
   aws rds describe-reserved-db-instances
   ```

3. Parse the output: The output from the previous command includes a lot of information. You need to parse this output to get the details of each reserved instance. You can use the `jq` command-line JSON processor for this. The following command will return the reserved instance ID, offering type, state, and the number of days until the reserved instance expires.

   ```
   aws rds describe-reserved-db-instances | jq -r '.ReservedDBInstances[] | {ReservedDBInstanceId: .ReservedDBInstanceId, OfferingType: .OfferingType, State: .State, Duration: .Duration}'
   ```

4. Check for expiration: Now that you have the details of each reserved instance, you can check if any of them are about to expire. The `Duration` field in the output from the previous command gives the duration of the reserved instance in seconds. You can convert this to days and check if it is less than 30. If it is, then the reserved instance is about to expire.

   ```
   aws rds describe-reserved-db-instances | jq -r '.ReservedDBInstances[] | select(.Duration / 86400 < 30) | .ReservedDBInstanceId'
   ```

   This command will return the IDs of all reserved instances that are about to expire in less than 30 days.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You can set up your AWS credentials in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI tool to configure them:

```bash
aws configure
```

3. Create a Python script to list all RDS Reserved Instances and their expiration dates:

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Create a client
client = boto3.client('rds')

# Get all RDS Reserved Instances
response = client.describe_reserved_db_instances()

# Check each RDS Reserved Instance
for instance in response['ReservedDBInstances']:
    # Get the expiration date
    expiration_date = instance['ReservedDBInstancesOfferingType']
    # Check if the expiration date is within the next 30 days
    if expiration_date <= datetime.now() + timedelta(days=30):
        print(f"RDS Reserved Instance {instance['ReservedDBInstanceId']} will expire soon.")
```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using any Python interpreter. This script will print out the IDs of all RDS Reserved Instances that will expire within the next 30 days. If no instances are printed, then there are no instances that will expire soon.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To renew RDS Reserved Instances before expiration in AWS RDS using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console at https://aws.amazon.com/ and login with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to RDS Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page, then select "RDS" under the Database section.

3. **Select Reserved Instances**: In the left-hand navigation pane, click on "Reserved Instances" to view the list of your existing reserved instances.

4. **Identify Expiring Reserved Instances**: Look for the Reserved Instances that are nearing expiration (within 30 days) in the list displayed.

5. **Select the Reserved Instance**: Click on the checkbox next to the Reserved Instance that you want to renew before expiration.

6. **Click on Actions**: At the top of the Reserved Instances page, click on the "Actions" dropdown menu.

7. **Select Renew Reserved Instances**: From the Actions dropdown menu, select "Renew Reserved Instances".

8. **Review and Confirm**: Review the details of the renewal, including the term length and payment options. Confirm that you want to renew the Reserved Instance.

9. **Complete the Renewal Process**: Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the renewal process. You may need to provide payment information if the renewal involves additional charges.

10. **Verify Renewal**: Once the renewal process is complete, verify that the Reserved Instance now shows an updated expiration date that is beyond the next 30 days.

By following these steps, you can successfully renew your RDS Reserved Instances before they expire in AWS using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To renew RDS Reserved Instances before expiration (30 days) in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. List all the existing reserved instances to identify the ones that are expiring within the next 30 days:
```bash
aws rds describe-reserved-db-instances
```

2. Identify the Reserved Instance that is expiring within the next 30 days and note down its Reserved Instance ID.

3. Modify the existing Reserved Instance to renew it for another term. You can do this by using the `modify-db-instance` command:
```bash
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier your-db-instance-id --reserved-db-instance-id your-reserved-instance-id --reserved-db-instances-offering-id new-reserved-offering-id
```
Replace `your-db-instance-id` with the DB instance identifier, `your-reserved-instance-id` with the Reserved Instance ID, and `new-reserved-offering-id` with the ID of the new Reserved Instance offering.

4. Verify that the Reserved Instance has been successfully renewed by describing the reserved instance again:
```bash
aws rds describe-reserved-db-instances
```

By following these steps, you can renew RDS Reserved Instances before expiration in AWS using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of not renewing RDS Reserved Instances before expiration in AWS using Python, you can create a script that checks the expiration date of the reserved instances and automatically renews them if they are set to expire within the next 30 days. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

1. **Install Boto3**: Make sure you have the Boto3 library installed in your Python environment. Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python and allows you to interact with AWS services.

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create Python Script**:
   Create a Python script (e.g., `renew_rds_reserved_instances.py`) with the following code:

   ```python
   import boto3
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Initialize the RDS client
   rds_client = boto3.client('rds')

   # Get a list of all reserved instances
   reserved_instances = rds_client.describe_reserved_db_instances()

   # Check each reserved instance for expiration within the next 30 days
   for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedDBInstances']:
       expiration_date = reserved_instance['EndTime']
       days_until_expiration = (expiration_date - datetime.now()).days

       if days_until_expiration <= 30:
           # Renew the reserved instance
           response = rds_client.modify_reserved_db_instances(
               ReservedDBInstanceId=reserved_instance['ReservedDBInstanceId'],
               ReservedDBInstancesOfferingId=reserved_instance['ReservedDBInstancesOfferingId'],
               Duration=reserved_instance['Duration'])
           print(f"Renewed reserved instance {reserved_instance['ReservedDBInstanceId']}")

   ```

3. **AWS Credentials**:
   Ensure that your AWS credentials are properly configured either through environment variables or `~/.aws/credentials` file.

4. **Run the Script**:
   Run the Python script using your preferred method (e.g., `python renew_rds_reserved_instances.py`). The script will check all your RDS reserved instances and renew those that are set to expire within the next 30 days.

By following these steps, you can automatically renew RDS Reserved Instances before they expire in AWS using Python.
