<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent RDS Reserved Instances from having a status of "Payment Failed" using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK (Boto3) and Authentication:**
   - Ensure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed.
   - Configure your AWS credentials.

   ```python
   import boto3
   from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError

   # Initialize a session using Amazon RDS
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='YOUR_REGION'
   )

   rds_client = session.client('rds')
   ```

2. **Monitor Reserved Instances:**
   - Create a function to list and monitor the status of your RDS Reserved Instances.

   ```python
   def list_reserved_instances():
       try:
           response = rds_client.describe_reserved_db_instances()
           reserved_instances = response['ReservedDBInstances']
           return reserved_instances
       except (NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError) as e:
           print(f"Error: {e}")
           return []

   reserved_instances = list_reserved_instances()
   ```

3. **Check for Payment Status:**
   - Implement a function to check the payment status of each reserved instance.

   ```python
   def check_payment_status(reserved_instances):
       for instance in reserved_instances:
           if instance['State'] == 'payment-failed':
               print(f"Reserved Instance {instance['ReservedDBInstanceId']} has a payment failed status.")
               # Implement further actions like sending alerts or notifications
           else:
               print(f"Reserved Instance {instance['ReservedDBInstanceId']} is in {instance['State']} state.")

   check_payment_status(reserved_instances)
   ```

4. **Automate and Schedule the Script:**
   - Use a scheduling tool like `cron` (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to run the script at regular intervals to ensure continuous monitoring.

   ```python
   import schedule
   import time

   def job():
       reserved_instances = list_reserved_instances()
       check_payment_status(reserved_instances)

   # Schedule the job every day at a specific time
   schedule.every().day.at("10:00").do(job)

   while True:
       schedule.run_pending()
       time.sleep(1)
   ```

By following these steps, you can automate the monitoring of your RDS Reserved Instances and ensure that you are alerted if any instance has a "payment-failed" status. This proactive approach helps in preventing misconfigurations related to payment issues.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the RDS dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Reserved Instances". This will display a list of all your reserved instances.
3. For each reserved instance, check the "Status" column. If the status is "Payment Failed", it means that the payment for the reserved instance has failed.
4. To get more details about the payment failure, you can click on the reserved instance and check the "Payment Failed" status. It will provide you with more information about why the payment failed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all RDS Reserved Instances: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all your RDS Reserved Instances:

   ```
   aws rds describe-reserved-db-instances
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with details of all your RDS Reserved Instances.

3. Filter RDS Reserved Instances with Payment Failed status: You can filter the JSON output from the previous step to only show the RDS Reserved Instances that have a status of 'payment-failed'. You can do this using the 'jq' command-line JSON processor. If you don't have 'jq' installed, you can download it from the official 'jq' website. Here is the command to filter the JSON output:

   ```
   aws rds describe-reserved-db-instances | jq -r '.ReservedDBInstances[] | select(.State=="payment-failed")'
   ```

4. Review the output: The output of the above command will show you all the RDS Reserved Instances that have a status of 'payment-failed'. You can review this output to identify any misconfigurations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3):** First, you need to set up AWS SDK (Boto3) for Python. This allows your Python application, script, or lambda function to make requests to AWS services such as AWS RDS. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:** You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can configure it in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

Then input your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

3. **Create a Python Script to Check RDS Reserved Instances:** Now, you can create a Python script that uses Boto3 to check the status of your RDS Reserved Instances. Here's a simple script that does this:

```python
import boto3

def check_rds_reserved_instances():
    client = boto3.client('rds')
    response = client.describe_reserved_db_instances()

    for instance in response['ReservedDBInstances']:
        if instance['State'] == 'payment-failed':
            print(f"RDS Reserved Instance with ID {instance['ReservedDBInstanceId']} has payment failed status.")

check_rds_reserved_instances()
```

This script first creates a client for the RDS service. It then calls the `describe_reserved_db_instances` method to get a list of all RDS Reserved Instances. It then iterates over each instance, checking if its state is 'payment-failed'. If it is, it prints out the ID of the instance.

4. **Run the Python Script:** Finally, you can run the Python script using any Python interpreter. If there are any RDS Reserved Instances with a 'payment-failed' status, their IDs will be printed out. If not, nothing will be printed.

```bash
python check_rds_reserved_instances.py
```

Remember to replace `check_rds_reserved_instances.py` with the path to your Python script.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of RDS Reserved Instances having a status of "Payment Failed" in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Reserved Instances with Payment Failed Status**:
   - Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to describe all the RDS Reserved Instances.
   - Filter the instances that have a status of "Payment Failed".

2. **Modify the Reserved Instances**:
   - For each Reserved Instance with a status of "Payment Failed", you can modify the instance to update the payment details.
   - Use the `modify_reserved_db_instances` method from the Boto3 RDS client to update the payment details for the Reserved Instance.

3. **Update Payment Information**:
   - You will need to provide valid payment information to update the status of the Reserved Instance.
   - Use the `modify_db_instance` method to update the payment details of the Reserved Instance.

4. **Verify the Status**:
   - After updating the payment information, describe the Reserved Instance again to verify that the status is no longer "Payment Failed".

Here is a sample Python script to remediate the issue:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the RDS client
rds_client = boto3.client('rds')

# Describe all Reserved Instances
reserved_instances = rds_client.describe_reserved_db_instances()

# Filter Reserved Instances with Payment Failed status
payment_failed_instances = [instance for instance in reserved_instances['ReservedDBInstances'] if instance['State'] == 'payment-failed']

# Update payment information for each Reserved Instance with Payment Failed status
for instance in payment_failed_instances:
    # Modify the Reserved Instance to update payment details
    rds_client.modify_reserved_db_instances(ReservedDBInstanceId=instance['ReservedDBInstanceId'], PaymentType='POSTPAID')

    # Describe the modified Reserved Instance to verify the status
    modified_instance = rds_client.describe_reserved_db_instances(ReservedDBInstanceId=instance['ReservedDBInstanceId'])
    print(f"Reserved Instance {modified_instance['ReservedDBInstances'][0]['ReservedDBInstanceId']} status updated to {modified_instance['ReservedDBInstances'][0]['State']}")
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders in the script with actual values as per your AWS account configuration. Also, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify RDS Reserved Instances in your AWS account.
