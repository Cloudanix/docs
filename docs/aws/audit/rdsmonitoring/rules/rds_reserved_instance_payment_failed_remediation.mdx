### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Reserved Instances Should Not Have Status - Payment Failed" in AWS using AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the Amazon RDS console.
3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Reserved Instances".
4. In the Reserved Instances page, locate the RDS Reserved Instance that has the status "Payment Failed".
5. Select the Reserved Instance and click on "Modify Reserved Instances".
6. In the "Modify Reserved Instances" page, select the correct payment method and click on "Save Changes".
7. Once the payment method is updated, the status of the Reserved Instance will change to "Active".
8. Verify the status of the Reserved Instance and ensure it is "Active".

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "RDS Reserved Instances Should Not Have Status - Payment Failed" for AWS using AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the RDS Reserved Instances with Payment Failed status in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Identify the RDS Reserved Instances with Payment Failed status. You can use the following AWS CLI command to list all the RDS Reserved Instances with Payment Failed status:
```
aws rds describe-reserved-db-instances --query 'ReservedDBInstances[?PaymentReservationNotYetDue==`false` && State=="payment-failed"].ReservedDBInstanceId'
```
2. Once you have identified the RDS Reserved Instances with Payment Failed status, you can either delete them or modify their payment status. If you want to delete the RDS Reserved Instances, use the following AWS CLI command:
```
aws rds delete-reserved-db-instances --reserved-db-instance-id <reserved-db-instance-id>
```
Replace `<reserved-db-instance-id>` with the ID of the RDS Reserved Instance you want to delete.

3. If you want to modify the payment status of the RDS Reserved Instances, use the following AWS CLI command:
```
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <db-instance-identifier> --reserved-db-instance-id <reserved-db-instance-id> --apply-immediately
```
Replace `<db-instance-identifier>` with the ID of the RDS instance associated with the Reserved Instance and `<reserved-db-instance-id>` with the ID of the RDS Reserved Instance you want to modify.

4. After executing the above command, the payment status of the RDS Reserved Instance will be modified to "active". 

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to delete or modify the RDS Reserved Instances.

#### Using Python

To remediate RDS Reserved Instances with Payment Failed status in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDKs and libraries in Python:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Initialize the RDS client using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):

```python
rds = boto3.client('rds')
```

3. Retrieve the list of all RDS Reserved Instances using the `describe_reserved_db_instances()` method:

```python
reserved_instances = rds.describe_reserved_db_instances()
```

4. Loop through each Reserved Instance and check if its status is Payment Failed using the `state` attribute:

```python
for reserved_instance in reserved_instances['ReservedDBInstances']:
    if reserved_instance['State'] == 'payment-failed':
        # Remediate the Reserved Instance
```

5. To remediate the Reserved Instance, you can either delete it or modify its payment method. To delete the Reserved Instance, use the `delete_reserved_db_instance()` method:

```python
rds.delete_reserved_db_instance(
    ReservedDBInstanceId='your-reserved-instance-id'
)
```

6. Alternatively, you can modify the payment method using the `modify_reserved_db_instances()` method:

```python
rds.modify_reserved_db_instances(
    ReservedDBInstanceId='your-reserved-instance-id',
    PaymentType='AllUpfront'
)
```

7. Replace `your-reserved-instance-id` with the ID of the Reserved Instance that has a Payment Failed status.

8. Save and run the Python script to remediate the RDS Reserved Instances with Payment Failed status in AWS.
