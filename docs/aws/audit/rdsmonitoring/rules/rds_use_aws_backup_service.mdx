### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the RDS dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu and then selecting "RDS" under the "Database" category.
3. In the navigation pane, click on "Databases". This will display a list of all your RDS instances.
4. Select the RDS instance you want to check. In the "Details" section, look for the "Backup" field. If Amazon Backup is integrated with the RDS instance, it should display "Enabled". If it shows "Disabled", then Amazon Backup is not integrated with the RDS instance.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "describe-db-instances" command to list all your RDS instances. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with details of all your RDS instances.

3. To check if Amazon Backup is integrated with each RDS instance, you need to look for the "BackupRetentionPeriod" parameter in the output. If the value of this parameter is 0, it means that Amazon Backup is not integrated with the RDS instance.

   You can use the following command to filter out the instances where "BackupRetentionPeriod" is 0:

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[?BackupRetentionPeriod==`0`]'
   ```

4. If the above command returns any instances, it means those instances are not integrated with Amazon Backup. You can then take the necessary steps to enable Amazon Backup for those instances.

#### Using Python

1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including AWS S3, AWS EC2, AWS DynamoDB, and much more. To install it, you can use pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure it with your user credentials.

2. Import the necessary modules and establish a session with AWS:

   ```python
   import boto3
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ```

3. Create a client for 'rds' and list all RDS instances:

   ```python
   rds_client = session.client('rds')
   response = rds_client.describe_db_instances()
   ```

4. Check if Amazon Backup is integrated with each RDS instance:

   ```python
   for instance in response['DBInstances']:
       instance_id = instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']
       backup_retention_period = instance['BackupRetentionPeriod']
       if backup_retention_period == 0:
           print(f"Amazon Backup is not integrated with RDS instance {instance_id}")
   ```
   
   This script will print out the IDs of all RDS instances that do not have Amazon Backup integrated. If the `BackupRetentionPeriod` is 0, it means that automated backups are disabled for that instance.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To integrate Amazon Backup with Amazon RDS in AWS, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to the Amazon RDS Console**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page, then select "RDS" under the Database section.

3. **Select your RDS Instance**: From the list of RDS instances, select the instance for which you want to enable backups.

4. **Enable Automated Backups**: In the RDS dashboard for your selected instance, click on the "Modify" button.

5. **Configure Backup Settings**: Scroll down to the "Backup" section of the Modify DB Instance page. Ensure that the "Backup Retention Period" is set to a value greater than 0 to enable automated backups.

6. **Enable Enhanced Backup Retention**: Under the "Backup" section, enable the "Enable Enhanced Backup Retention" option. This will allow you to retain automated backups for a longer period.

7. **Save Changes**: Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the "Continue" button. Review the changes you have made, then click on the "Modify DB Instance" button to save the changes.

8. **Verify Backup Configuration**: Once the modification is complete, go back to the RDS dashboard and check that automated backups are enabled for your RDS instance.

By following these steps, you have successfully integrated Amazon Backup with Amazon RDS in AWS, ensuring that your RDS instance is backed up automatically according to the configured settings.

#### Using CLI

To integrate Amazon Backup with Amazon RDS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Amazon RDS automated backups**: If automated backups are not already enabled for your Amazon RDS instance, you need to enable them. You can enable automated backups by modifying the RDS instance with the following command:
   ```
   aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier your-db-instance-name --backup-retention-period 7
   ```
   Replace `your-db-instance-name` with the actual name of your RDS instance and `7` with the desired retention period for backups in days.

2. **Enable the AWS Backup service for Amazon RDS**: You need to create a backup plan in AWS Backup and include your RDS instance in that plan. You can create a backup plan using the AWS Backup console or AWS CLI. Here's an example command to create a backup plan using AWS CLI:
   ```
   aws backup create-backup-plan --backup-plan file://backup-plan.json
   ```
   In the `backup-plan.json` file, specify the details of your backup plan including the schedule, retention period, and the resources to be backed up (in this case, your RDS instance).

3. **Tag your Amazon RDS instance with the correct backup plan**: After creating the backup plan, you need to tag your RDS instance with the backup plan ID. You can do this using the following command:
   ```
   aws backup tag-resource --resource-arn arn:aws:rds:region:account-id:db:your-db-instance-name --tags "Key=backup-plan-id,Value=your-backup-plan-id"
   ```
   Replace `region`, `account-id`, `your-db-instance-name`, and `your-backup-plan-id` with the appropriate values.

4. **Verify the backup configuration**: You can verify that the Amazon Backup service is integrated with your Amazon RDS instance by checking the backup settings in the AWS Backup console or by running the following command:
   ```
   aws backup describe-backup-plan --backup-plan-id your-backup-plan-id
   ```
   Replace `your-backup-plan-id` with the ID of the backup plan you created.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration and integrate Amazon Backup with Amazon RDS in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To integrate Amazon Backup with Amazon RDS in AWS using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to automate the process. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this misconfiguration:

1. Install Boto3:
   Make sure you have the Boto3 library installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials:
   Ensure that you have configured your AWS credentials either by setting up environment variables or using the AWS CLI `aws configure` command.

3. Write Python Script:
   Create a Python script with the following code to enable backups for your Amazon RDS instance:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize the RDS client
   rds_client = boto3.client('rds')

   # Specify the RDS instance identifier
   db_instance_identifier = 'your_rds_instance_identifier'

   # Enable backups for the RDS instance
   response = rds_client.modify_db_instance(
       DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance_identifier,
       BackupRetentionPeriod=7,  # Set the number of days to retain backups
       ApplyImmediately=True
   )

   print(response)
   ```

   Replace `'your_rds_instance_identifier'` with the actual identifier of your RDS instance.

4. Run the Script:
   Save the script to a file (e.g., `enable_rds_backup.py`) and run it using Python:
   ```
   python enable_rds_backup.py
   ```

5. Verify Backup Configuration:
   After running the script, verify that backups are enabled for your Amazon RDS instance by checking the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI.

By following these steps and running the Python script, you can successfully integrate Amazon Backup with Amazon RDS in AWS.
