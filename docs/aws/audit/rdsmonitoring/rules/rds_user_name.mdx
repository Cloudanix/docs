How to ensure RDS master username is unique?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon RDS service.
2. Click on the name of the RDS instance for which you want to modify the master username.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Master Username Should Be Unique" Policy.)
3. In the instance details page, click on the "Configuration" tab.
4. Under the "Database options" section, locate the "Master username" field.
5. Click on the "Modify" button next to the "Master username" field.
6. In the "Modify DB instance" window, enter a new, unique master username that you want to use for the RDS instance. Avoid using common usernames like "awsuser" or "admin."
7. Click on the "Apply immediately" checkbox to apply the changes immediately. If you don't select this option, the changes will be applied during the next maintenance window for the RDS instance.
8. Click on the "Modify DB instance" button to save the changes and modify the master username.
9. Repeat these steps for each Amazon RDS database instance to ensure that the master username is unique and not set to commonly used usernames.

Additionally, you can enforce the use of unique and secure master usernames during the creation of new RDS instances by following these steps:
1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon RDS service.
2. Click on the "Instances" link in the left navigation pane.
3. Click on the "Parameter groups" tab.
4. Click on the "Create parameter group" button to create a new parameter group.
5. Give the parameter group a name and description, and select the appropriate DB engine family.
6. In the new parameter group, click on the "Edit parameters" button.
7. Search for the parameter named "master_username_pattern" and modify its value to specify the desired pattern for the master username. For example, you can set it to a regular expression that enforces uniqueness and excludes common usernames.
8. Save the changes to the parameter group.
9. Associate the parameter group with the relevant RDS instances by modifying the instances' configuration and selecting the newly created parameter group.
