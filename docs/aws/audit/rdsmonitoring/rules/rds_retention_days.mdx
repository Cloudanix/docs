How to have RDS backup policy to retain for at least 7 days?

#### Using AWS Console

To set up an RDS backup policy to retain backups for at least 7 days, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon RDS service.

2. Select the RDS instance for which you want to configure the backup policy.

3. Click on the "Configuration" tab.

4. Scroll down to the "Backup" section and click on "Modify".

5. In the "Backup retention period" field, enter the desired value of 7.

6. Scroll down and click on "Continue".

7. Review the changes and click on "Modify DB Instance".

8. Once the modification is complete, RDS will automatically retain backups for the specified duration of 7 days.

By setting the backup retention period to 7 days, RDS will ensure that backups are retained for at least that duration. It's important to note that RDS retains automated backups based on the backup window and the retention period you set.
