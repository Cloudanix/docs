### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Reserved Instances". This will display a list of all your reserved instances.

3. Check the "Purchase Date" of each reserved instance. If the purchase date is more than 7 days ago, it means that the reserved instance has not been reviewed in the last 7 days.

4. Additionally, you can also check the "State" of each reserved instance. If the state is "active", it means that the reserved instance is currently in use. If the state is "retired", it means that the reserved instance is no longer in use and should be reviewed.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure to configure it with the necessary access keys and region.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the `describe-reserved-db-instances` command to list all your reserved RDS instances. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws rds describe-reserved-db-instances
   ```

   This command will return a JSON output with details about all your reserved RDS instances.

3. To review the purchases every 7 days, you can write a script that runs this command and checks the `StartTime` field of each reserved instance. If the `StartTime` is more than 7 days ago, it means the reserved instance purchase should be reviewed.

4. Here is a simple Python script that uses the `boto3` library to do this:

   ```python
   import boto3
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Create a client for the AWS RDS service
   rds = boto3.client('rds')

   # Get the current time
   now = datetime.now()

   # Get all reserved RDS instances
   reserved_instances = rds.describe_reserved_db_instances()

   # Loop through all reserved instances
   for instance in reserved_instances['ReservedDBInstances']:
       # Get the start time of the reserved instance
       start_time = instance['StartTime']

       # If the start time is more than 7 days ago, print a message
       if now - start_time > timedelta(days=7):
           print(f"Reserved instance {instance['ReservedDBInstanceId']} should be reviewed.")
   ```

   This script will print a message for each reserved instance that was purchased more than 7 days ago. You can run this script every 7 days to review your reserved instance purchases.

#### Using Python

1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, configure your AWS credentials. You can configure credentials by using the AWS CLI:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   It will prompt you for your Access Key Id, Secret Access Key, Default Region Name, and Default Output Format.

2. **Create a Python Script to Fetch RDS Reserved Instances:**
   You can use the `describe_reserved_db_instances` method provided by the RDS client in boto3. This method returns information about reserved DB instances for this AWS account, or about a specified reserved DB instance.

   ```python
   import boto3

   def get_rds_reserved_instances():
       rds = boto3.client('rds')
       response = rds.describe_reserved_db_instances()
       return response['ReservedDBInstances']
   ```

3. **Check the Purchase Date of Each Reserved Instance:**
   Each reserved instance in the response contains a `StartTime` field that indicates when the reservation started. You can compare this date with the current date to check if it's older than 7 days.

   ```python
   import datetime

   def check_purchase_date(reserved_instances):
       for instance in reserved_instances:
           purchase_date = instance['StartTime']
           if (datetime.datetime.now(purchase_date.tzinfo) - purchase_date).days > 7:
               print(f"Reserved instance {instance['ReservedDBInstanceId']} should be reviewed.")
   ```

4. **Run the Script Regularly:**
   You should run this script regularly to ensure that all RDS reserved instances are reviewed every 7 days. You can use a cron job or a similar scheduling mechanism to run the script automatically.

   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       reserved_instances = get_rds_reserved_instances()
       check_purchase_date(reserved_instances)
   ```
   
Please note that this script only prints the IDs of the reserved instances that should be reviewed. You might want to extend it to send notifications or take other actions.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not reviewing RDS Reserved Instances purchases every 7 days in AWS using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to the RDS Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page, then select "RDS" under the Database category.

3. **Review Reserved Instances**: In the RDS dashboard, locate the "Reserved Instances" option in the left-hand menu and click on it.

4. **Check Purchase History**: Review the list of your Reserved Instances to ensure they have been purchased and are being utilized effectively. Look for any instances that may not be optimized or are not in use.

5. **Set Up a Reminder**: To ensure that you review your Reserved Instances every 7 days, you can set up a reminder in the AWS Management Console. You can use AWS CloudWatch Events to create a rule that triggers a reminder notification every 7 days.

6. **Create a CloudWatch Event Rule**:
   - Go to the AWS CloudWatch service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click on "Rules" in the left-hand menu and then click on "Create rule".
   - Under "Event Source", select "Schedule".
   - Set the schedule to run every 7 days or as per your requirement.
   - Under "Targets", choose the target for your reminder notification (e.g., SNS topic, Lambda function).
   - Click on "Configure details", give your rule a name and description, and then click on "Create rule".

7. **Monitor and Review**: Ensure that you receive the reminder notifications every 7 days to review your RDS Reserved Instances purchases. Make any necessary adjustments to optimize your Reserved Instances based on your usage and requirements.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not reviewing RDS Reserved Instances purchases every 7 days in AWS using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of not reviewing RDS Reserved Instances purchases every 7 days in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **List all the Reserved Instances in AWS RDS**:
   
   Run the following AWS CLI command to list all the Reserved Instances in your AWS account:

   ```bash
   aws rds describe-reserved-db-instances
   ```

2. **Identify the Purchase Date of each Reserved Instance**:

   From the output of the previous command, note down the `OfferingType` and `StartTime` values for each Reserved Instance. The `StartTime` field indicates when the Reserved Instance was purchased.

3. **Calculate the Age of Each Reserved Instance**:

   Calculate the age of each Reserved Instance by comparing the `StartTime` with the current date. If any Reserved Instance is older than 7 days, it needs to be reviewed.

4. **Set up a Scheduled AWS Lambda Function**:

   Create an AWS Lambda function that uses the AWS SDK to list all the Reserved Instances and their purchase dates. The Lambda function should compare the purchase date with the current date and send a notification if any Reserved Instance is older than 7 days.

5. **Create an AWS CloudWatch Event Rule**:

   Set up a CloudWatch Event Rule that triggers the Lambda function on a schedule (e.g., every 7 days). This will automate the process of reviewing RDS Reserved Instances purchases regularly.

6. **Configure Notifications**:

   Configure the Lambda function to send notifications (e.g., via Amazon SNS) to the appropriate stakeholders if any Reserved Instance needs to be reviewed.

By following these steps and automating the process using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Events, you can ensure that RDS Reserved Instances purchases are reviewed every 7 days in AWS.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of not reviewing RDS Reserved Instances purchases every 7 days in AWS using Python, you can create a Lambda function that will be triggered by a CloudWatch Events rule on a 7-day schedule. Below are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this misconfiguration:
