### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the RDS dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top menu and then selecting "RDS" under the "Database" category.
3. In the navigation pane, click on "DB Clusters". This will display a list of all your DB clusters.
4. For each of your Aurora DB clusters, check the "Backup" section in the "Details" tab. If the "Backup Retention Period" is set to 0 days or if the "Backup Window" is not set, then the Aurora DB cluster is not protected by a backup plan.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all DB clusters: Use the `describe-db-clusters` command to list all your DB clusters. This command returns information about the DB clusters associated with your account.

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-clusters --query 'DBClusters[*].[DBClusterIdentifier]'
   ```
   This command will return a list of all DB cluster identifiers.

3. Check backup configuration for each DB cluster: For each DB cluster, use the `describe-db-cluster-snapshots` command to check the backup configuration. This command returns information about the DB cluster snapshots for the specified DB cluster.

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-cluster-snapshots --db-cluster-identifier <DBClusterIdentifier>
   ```
   Replace `<DBClusterIdentifier>` with the identifier of your DB cluster. This command will return a list of all snapshots for the specified DB cluster.

4. Analyze the output: The output of the `describe-db-cluster-snapshots` command includes the `SnapshotType` field. If the value of this field is `automated`, it means that the DB cluster is protected by a backup plan. If not, the DB cluster is not protected by a backup plan. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each DB cluster in your account.

#### Using Python

To check if Aurora DB Clusters are protected by a backup plan in RDS using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to directly interact with AWS services, including RDS. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the Boto3 library in Python:**
   Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. To use Boto3, you first need to import it.

   ```python
   import boto3
   ```

2. **Create an RDS client:**
   You need to create an RDS client to interact with AWS RDS. You can do this using the `boto3.client()` function.

   ```python
   rds = boto3.client('rds')
   ```

3. **List all DB clusters:**
   You can list all DB clusters using the `describe_db_clusters()` function. This function returns a response object that contains all DB clusters.

   ```python
   response = rds.describe_db_clusters()
   ```

4. **Check if DB clusters are protected by a backup plan:**
   You can check if each DB cluster is protected by a backup plan by checking the `BackupRetentionPeriod` attribute of each DB cluster. If the `BackupRetentionPeriod` is 0, then the DB cluster is not protected by a backup plan.

   ```python
   for db_cluster in response['DBClusters']:
       if db_cluster['BackupRetentionPeriod'] == 0:
           print(f"DB cluster {db_cluster['DBClusterIdentifier']} is not protected by a backup plan.")
   ```

This script will print out the identifiers of all DB clusters that are not protected by a backup plan.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Aurora DB clusters not being protected by a backup plan in AWS RDS, follow these step-by-step instructions using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/) and login using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to RDS Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown at the top left corner of the console, then select "RDS" under the Database category.

3. **Select Aurora Database Cluster**: From the list of RDS database instances, locate and click on the Aurora DB cluster that you want to configure a backup plan for.

4. **Enable Automated Backups**: In the Aurora cluster dashboard, click on the "Modify" button to edit the cluster settings.

5. **Configure Backup Retention Period**: Scroll down to the "Backup" section, locate the "Backup retention period" option, and set a value for how long you want to retain automated backups. The minimum retention period is 1 day.

6. **Enable Automated Backups**: Make sure the "Backup retention period" is greater than 0 to enable automated backups for the Aurora cluster.

7. **Configure Backup Window**: Optionally, you can set a preferred backup window during which automated backups will be taken. This helps in avoiding performance impact during peak usage hours.

8. **Enable Backup Encryption (Optional)**: If required, you can enable backup encryption by selecting the option for "Backup encryption" and choosing a KMS key to encrypt your backups.

9. **Review and Apply Changes**: Review the changes you have made to the Aurora cluster configuration. Once you are satisfied with the settings, click on the "Apply immediately" checkbox and then click on the "Modify cluster" button to apply the changes.

10. **Verify Backup Plan**: After the modification is completed, go back to the Aurora cluster dashboard and verify that automated backups are enabled and the backup retention period is set as per your configuration.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of Aurora DB clusters not being protected by a backup plan in AWS RDS. Automated backups will now be taken according to the configured schedule, ensuring data protection and recovery capabilities for your Aurora cluster.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Aurora DB clusters not being protected by a backup plan in AWS RDS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Backup Plan**:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to create a backup plan for your Aurora DB cluster:
     ```
     aws backup create-backup-plan --backup-plan '{"BackupPlanName": "YourBackupPlanName", "Rules": [{"RuleName": "Rule1", "TargetBackupVaultName": "Default", "ScheduleExpression": "cron(0 0 * * ? *)", "StartWindowMinutes": 60}]}'
     ```
   - Replace `"YourBackupPlanName"` with a suitable name for your backup plan.
   - This command creates a backup plan with a rule named "Rule1" that schedules daily backups at midnight UTC.

2. **Associate the Backup Plan with the Aurora DB Cluster**:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to associate the backup plan with your Aurora DB cluster:
     ```
     aws backup create-backup-selection --backup-plan-id <BackupPlanId> --backup-selection '{"SelectionName": "YourSelectionName", "IamRoleArn": "YourIamRoleArn", "Resources": ["arn:aws:rds:region:account-id:cluster:cluster-name"]}'
     ```
   - Replace `<BackupPlanId>` with the ID of the backup plan you created in step 1.
   - Replace `"YourSelectionName"` with a suitable name for your backup selection.
   - Replace `"YourIamRoleArn"` with the IAM role ARN that has permissions to perform backups.
   - Replace `"region"`, `"account-id"`, and `"cluster-name"` with your AWS region, account ID, and Aurora DB cluster name, respectively.

3. **Verify the Backup Plan Configuration**:
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to verify that the backup plan is associated with the Aurora DB cluster:
     ```
     aws backup list-backup-selections --backup-plan-id <BackupPlanId>
     ```
   - This command will list the backup selections associated with the specified backup plan.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Aurora DB clusters not being protected by a backup plan in AWS RDS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Aurora DB clusters not being protected by a backup plan in AWS RDS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Boto3**: Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python, which allows you to interact with AWS services. You can install it using pip:
   
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create a Python script** to enable backups for your Aurora DB cluster. Here is an example script that you can use:

```python
import boto3

# Define the AWS region and your Aurora DB cluster identifier
region = 'your_aws_region'
cluster_identifier = 'your_cluster_identifier'

# Create an RDS client
rds = boto3.client('rds', region_name=region)

# Enable backups for the Aurora DB cluster
response = rds.modify_db_cluster(
    DBClusterIdentifier=cluster_identifier,
    BackupRetentionPeriod=7,  # Set the number of days to retain backups
    BackupWindow='03:00-04:00',  # Set the preferred backup window
    ApplyImmediately=True
)

print("Backup plan enabled for Aurora DB cluster:", cluster_identifier)
```

3. **Replace placeholders**: Replace `your_aws_region` with the AWS region where your Aurora DB cluster is located, and `your_cluster_identifier` with the actual identifier of your Aurora DB cluster.

4. **Run the script**: Save the script to a file (e.g., `enable_backup_plan.py`) and run it using Python. Make sure you have the necessary permissions in your AWS IAM role to modify the Aurora DB cluster.

```bash
python enable_backup_plan.py
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Aurora DB clusters not being protected by a backup plan in AWS RDS using Python.
