### How to Prevent
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent Aurora DB Clusters from being unprotected by a backup plan in Amazon RDS using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Automated Backups:**
   - Open the **Amazon RDS console**.
   - In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.
   - Select the Aurora DB cluster you want to configure.
   - Choose the **Modify** button.
   - In the **Backup** section, ensure that **Enable automated backups** is selected.
   - Set the **Backup retention period** to a value greater than 0 days.

2. **Configure Backup Window:**
   - In the same **Modify** page, scroll down to the **Backup window** section.
   - Specify a **Preferred backup window** that aligns with your maintenance and operational requirements. This ensures that backups are taken during a period of low activity.

3. **Enable Multi-AZ Deployment (Optional but Recommended):**
   - In the **Modify** page, under the **Availability & durability** section, consider enabling **Multi-AZ deployment**. This provides enhanced availability and durability for your database, ensuring that backups are taken from a standby instance, reducing the impact on the primary instance.

4. **Apply Changes:**
   - After configuring the backup settings, scroll to the bottom of the **Modify** page.
   - Choose **Continue** and then **Apply immediately** or schedule the changes during the next maintenance window, depending on your preference.

By following these steps, you ensure that your Aurora DB clusters are protected by a robust backup plan, minimizing the risk of data loss.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To ensure that Aurora DB Clusters are protected by a backup plan in Amazon RDS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Backup Plan:**
   First, you need to create a backup plan using AWS Backup. This plan will define the backup rules and schedules.

   ```sh
   aws backup create-backup-plan --backup-plan '{
       "BackupPlanName": "AuroraBackupPlan",
       "Rules": [
           {
               "RuleName": "DailyBackup",
               "TargetBackupVaultName": "Default",
               "ScheduleExpression": "cron(0 12 * * ? *)",
               "StartWindowMinutes": 60,
               "CompletionWindowMinutes": 180,
               "Lifecycle": {
                   "MoveToColdStorageAfterDays": 30,
                   "DeleteAfterDays": 365
               }
           }
       ]
   }'
   ```

2. **Assign Resources to the Backup Plan:**
   Assign the Aurora DB Cluster to the backup plan by creating a backup selection.

   ```sh
   aws backup create-backup-selection --backup-plan-id <BackupPlanId> --backup-selection '{
       "SelectionName": "AuroraDBClusterSelection",
       "IamRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::<AccountId>:role/service-role/AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole",
       "Resources": [
           "arn:aws:rds:<Region>:<AccountId>:cluster:<DBClusterIdentifier>"
       ]
   }'
   ```

3. **Enable Automated Backups:**
   Ensure that automated backups are enabled for your Aurora DB Cluster.

   ```sh
   aws rds modify-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier <DBClusterIdentifier> --backup-retention-period 7
   ```

4. **Verify Backup Configuration:**
   Verify that the backup plan and selection are correctly configured and that the Aurora DB Cluster is included.

   ```sh
   aws backup list-backup-plans
   aws backup list-backup-selections --backup-plan-id <BackupPlanId>
   aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier <DBClusterIdentifier>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Aurora DB Clusters are protected by a backup plan using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent Aurora DB Clusters from being unprotected by a backup plan in Amazon RDS using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here are the steps to ensure that your Aurora DB Clusters are protected by a backup plan:

### Step 1: Install Boto3
First, ensure that you have Boto3 installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

### Step 2: Configure AWS Credentials
Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can do this by setting up the `~/.aws/credentials` file or by using environment variables.

### Step 3: Create a Python Script to Enable Backups
Here is a Python script that will enable automated backups for your Aurora DB Clusters:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize a session using Amazon RDS
client = boto3.client('rds')

def enable_backup_for_aurora_clusters():
    # Describe all DB clusters
    response = client.describe_db_clusters()
    
    for cluster in response['DBClusters']:
        cluster_id = cluster['DBClusterIdentifier']
        
        # Check if the backup retention period is set to 0 (which means no backups)
        if cluster['BackupRetentionPeriod'] == 0:
            print(f"Enabling backup for DB Cluster: {cluster_id}")
            
            # Modify the DB cluster to enable backups
            client.modify_db_cluster(
                DBClusterIdentifier=cluster_id,
                BackupRetentionPeriod=7  # Set the retention period to 7 days or any other value as needed
            )
        else:
            print(f"DB Cluster {cluster_id} already has backups enabled with a retention period of {cluster['BackupRetentionPeriod']} days.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enable_backup_for_aurora_clusters()
```

### Step 4: Run the Script
Execute the script to ensure that all your Aurora DB Clusters have automated backups enabled:
```bash
python enable_aurora_backups.py
```

### Summary
1. **Install Boto3**: Ensure Boto3 is installed using pip.
2. **Configure AWS Credentials**: Set up your AWS credentials.
3. **Create Python Script**: Write a Python script to enable backups for Aurora DB Clusters.
4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Aurora DB Clusters are protected by a backup plan using Python scripts.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the RDS dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.
3. In the navigation pane, click on 'DB Clusters'.
4. In the 'DB Clusters' section, select the Aurora DB cluster that you want to examine.
5. In the 'Details' section, check the 'Backup' settings. If the 'Backup Retention Period' is set to '0 days', it means the Aurora DB cluster is not protected by a backup plan.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all DB clusters: Use the `describe-db-clusters` command to list all your DB clusters. This command returns information about the DB clusters associated with your account.

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-clusters --query 'DBClusters[*].[DBClusterIdentifier]' --output text
   ```
   This command will list all the DB cluster identifiers.

3. Check the backup retention period: For each DB cluster, use the `describe-db-clusters` command again to get the backup retention period. If the backup retention period is 0, the DB cluster is not protected by a backup plan.

   ```
   aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier <DBClusterIdentifier> --query 'DBClusters[*].[BackupRetentionPeriod]' --output text
   ```
   Replace `<DBClusterIdentifier>` with the identifier of your DB cluster. This command will return the backup retention period for the specified DB cluster.

4. Repeat step 3 for each DB cluster: You need to repeat the previous step for each DB cluster in your account. If any of the DB clusters have a backup retention period of 0, they are not protected by a backup plan.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if Aurora DB Clusters are protected by a backup plan in RDS using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which allows you to directly interact with AWS services, including RDS. Here are the steps:

1. **Import the Boto3 library in Python:**
   Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. To use Boto3, you first need to import it.

   ```python
   import boto3
   ```

2. **Create an RDS client:**
   You need to create an RDS client to interact with AWS RDS. You can do this using the `boto3.client()` function.

   ```python
   rds = boto3.client('rds')
   ```

3. **List all DB clusters:**
   You can list all DB clusters using the `describe_db_clusters()` function. This function returns a response object that contains all DB clusters.

   ```python
   response = rds.describe_db_clusters()
   ```

4. **Check if DB clusters are protected by a backup plan:**
   You can check if each DB cluster is protected by a backup plan by checking the `BackupRetentionPeriod` attribute of each DB cluster. If the `BackupRetentionPeriod` is 0, then the DB cluster is not protected by a backup plan.

   ```python
   for db_cluster in response['DBClusters']:
       if db_cluster['BackupRetentionPeriod'] == 0:
           print(f"DB cluster {db_cluster['DBClusterIdentifier']} is not protected by a backup plan.")
   ```

This script will print out the identifiers of all DB clusters that are not protected by a backup plan.
