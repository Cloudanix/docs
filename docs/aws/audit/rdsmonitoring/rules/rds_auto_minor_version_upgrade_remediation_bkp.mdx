How to enable auto minor upgrade for RDS?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon RDS service.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Auto Minor Version Upgrade flag Should Be Enabled" Policy.)
2. Click on the name of the RDS instance for which you want to enable auto minor upgrades.
3. In the instance details page, click on the "Configuration" tab.
4. Under the "Maintenance & backups" section, locate the "Auto minor version upgrade" option.
5. Click on the "Edit" button next to the "Auto minor version upgrade" option.
6. In the "Modify DB instance" window, select the checkbox for "Enable auto minor version upgrade".
7. Optionally, you can specify a maintenance window during which the upgrades will be applied. This allows you to control the timing of the upgrades to minimize any impact on your application.
8. Click on the "Apply immediately" checkbox to apply the changes immediately. If you don't select this option, the changes will be applied during the next maintenance window for the RDS instance.
9. Click on the "Modify DB instance" button to save the changes and enable auto minor upgrades.
10. Auto minor upgrades will now be enabled for the selected RDS instance. The database engine will automatically apply minor version upgrades during the specified maintenance window or the next available window.
