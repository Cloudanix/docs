### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Instance Deletion Protection should be enabled" in AWS using AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to AWS console.
2. Go to EC2 dashboard.
3. Click on "Instances" from the left-hand side menu.
4. Select the instance for which you want to enable deletion protection.
5. Right-click on the instance and select "Instance Settings" from the drop-down menu.
6. Click on "Change Termination Protection" from the pop-up menu.
7. Select the checkbox for "Enable Termination Protection" and click on "Save".
8. A confirmation message will be displayed that termination protection is enabled for the selected instance.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Instance Deletion Protection should be enabled" for AWS using AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the instance deletion protection misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.
2. Run the following command to enable instance deletion protection for all instances in the default region:

   ```
   aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --disable-api-termination "{\"Value\":true}"
   ```

   Note: Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance you want to protect.

3. Verify that instance deletion protection is enabled by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --attribute disableApiTermination
   ```

   Note: Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the instance you want to protect.

   This command should return a JSON object with the `Value` field set to `true`.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the instance deletion protection misconfiguration for AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the instance deletion protection misconfiguration in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK for Python (boto3) library.

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create a boto3 client for EC2 service.

```python
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

3. Get the list of all instances in the AWS account.

```python
instances = ec2.describe_instances()
```

4. Loop through all the instances and check if the instance deletion protection is enabled or not. If it is not enabled, enable it using the `modify_instance_attribute` method.

```python
for reservation in instances['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
        instance_protection = instance['InstanceProtection']
        if not instance_protection['DeleteProtection']:
            ec2.modify_instance_attribute(
                InstanceId=instance_id,
                InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior='stop',
                DisableApiTermination={
                    'Value': True
                }
            )
            print(f"Instance deletion protection enabled for instance {instance_id}")
```

5. Verify that the instance deletion protection is enabled for all instances by checking the `DeleteProtection` attribute.

```python
instances = ec2.describe_instances()
for reservation in instances['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
        instance_protection = instance['InstanceProtection']
        if not instance_protection['DeleteProtection']:
            print(f"Instance deletion protection is not enabled for instance {instance_id}")
```

This code will enable instance deletion protection for all instances in your AWS account.
