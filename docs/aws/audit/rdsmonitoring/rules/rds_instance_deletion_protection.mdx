How to enable RDS Instance Deletion Protection?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the Amazon RDS console by navigating to the "Services" menu and selecting "RDS" under the "Database" section.
3. Select the RDS instance for which you want to enable deletion protection.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Instance Deletion Protection Should Be Enabled" Policy.)
4. In the instance details page, click on the "Modify" button.
5. In the "Modify DB Instance" page, scroll down to the "Deletion protection" section.
6. Check the box next to "Enable deletion protection" to enable deletion protection for the instance.
7. Optionally, you can also check the box next to "Enable final DB snapshot" if you want to require a final DB snapshot to be taken before deleting the instance. This can help in preserving a backup of the instance's data.
8. Click on the "Apply immediately" button to save the changes and enable deletion protection.
