### More Info:

Your RDS database instances should be using KMS CMK customer-managed keys rather than AWS managed-keys in order to have more granular control over your data-at-rest encryption/decryption process.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

GDPR, NIST, AWSWAF, HITRUST, SOC2, NISTCSF, PCIDSS, FedRAMP

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate this misconfiguration for AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) console.

3. Click on the "Customer managed keys" option in the left-hand menu.

4. Click on the "Create key" button.

5. Select the appropriate options for your key, such as the key material origin and key usage permissions.

6. Click "Next" to review your key settings.

7. Review your key settings and click "Finish" to create your customer-managed key.

8. Update your AWS resources to use the new customer-managed key.

9. Verify that your resources are using the new key by checking the key ID in the AWS Management Console.

10. Disable or delete any AWS-managed keys that are no longer needed.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration by using customer-managed keys instead of AWS-managed keys.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of using AWS-managed keys instead of customer-managed keys, follow these steps:

1. Create a customer-managed CMK (Customer Master Key) in AWS KMS (Key Management Service) using the AWS CLI command `aws kms create-key`. Make sure to specify the key policy that defines who can use the key.

2. Enable key rotation for the CMK using the AWS CLI command `aws kms enable-key-rotation`. This will automatically rotate the CMK every year.

3. Update the AWS service to use the newly created customer-managed CMK. This can be done through the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS CLI command `aws kms update-alias`. Specify the alias name and the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the customer-managed CMK.

4. Verify that the AWS service is now using the customer-managed CMK by checking the key ID or alias name in the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS CLI command `aws kms describe-key`. 

5. Delete the AWS-managed key that was previously used by the AWS service using the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS CLI command `aws kms schedule-key-deletion`. Specify the key ID and the number of days until the key is permanently deleted.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of using AWS-managed keys instead of customer-managed keys.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of using AWS-managed keys instead of customer-managed keys, you can use the following steps in Python:

1. Create a new customer-managed key using the AWS KMS (Key Management Service) API. You can use the following Python code to create a KMS key:

```python
import boto3

kms = boto3.client('kms')

response = kms.create_key(
    Description='Customer-managed key',
    KeyUsage='ENCRYPT_DECRYPT',
    Origin='AWS_KMS',
)

key_id = response['KeyMetadata']['KeyId']
print(f'Created customer-managed key with ID: {key_id}')
```

2. Update your AWS resources to use the new customer-managed key. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update your resources. For example, if you want to update an S3 bucket to use the new key, you can use the following Python code:

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

bucket_name = 'my-bucket'

response = s3.put_bucket_encryption(
    Bucket=bucket_name,
    ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration={
        'Rules': [
            {
                'ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault': {
                    'SSEAlgorithm': 'aws:kms',
                    'KMSMasterKeyID': key_id,
                },
            },
        ],
    },
)

print(f'Updated encryption configuration for bucket {bucket_name}')
```

3. Verify that your AWS resources are now using the customer-managed key by checking the encryption configuration. For example, you can use the following Python code to check the encryption configuration of an S3 bucket:

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

bucket_name = 'my-bucket'

response = s3.get_bucket_encryption(
    Bucket=bucket_name,
)

rules = response.get('ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration', {}).get('Rules', [])

for rule in rules:
    if 'ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault' in rule:
        sse = rule['ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault']
        if sse.get('SSEAlgorithm') == 'aws:kms':
            kms_key_id = sse.get('KMSMasterKeyID')
            if kms_key_id == key_id:
                print(f'S3 bucket {bucket_name} is using the customer-managed key')
                break
else:
    print(f'S3 bucket {bucket_name} is not using the customer-managed key')
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of using AWS-managed keys instead of customer-managed keys in AWS using Python.
