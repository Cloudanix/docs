How to enable free storage space for RDS database.

#### Using AWS Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Amazon RDS service by selecting "RDS" from the services menu.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "RDS Databases Should Have Free Storage Space" Policy.)
3. In the RDS dashboard, click on "Databases" in the left navigation pane.
4. Locate the RDS database that is running on low disk space.
5. Click on the database name to access the database's configuration settings.
6. In the database details page, click on the "Modify" button.
7. In the "Modify DB Instance" page, scroll down to the "Storage" section.
8. In the "Allocated Storage" field, increase the value to allocate more storage space to the database.
   Note: Ensure that you have sufficient available storage in your AWS account to accommodate the increased allocation.
9. Review other storage-related settings, such as "Provisioned IOPS" and "Storage Type," and make any necessary adjustments according to your requirements.
10. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Modify DB Instance" button to save the changes.
11. The modification process may take some time to complete, during which the database might experience a brief interruption or slowdown.
12. Once the modification is finished, the database will have more allocated storage space, which should help resolve the low disk space issue.
