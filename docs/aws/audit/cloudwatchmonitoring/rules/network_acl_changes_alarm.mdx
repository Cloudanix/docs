<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access CloudWatch.

2. Once AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can use the following command to list all the alarms in CloudWatch:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the alarms that are currently configured in CloudWatch.

3. To specifically check for Network ACL Changes Alarm, you can filter the results using the `--alarm-names` option followed by the name of the alarm. For example:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names "Network ACL Changes Alarm"
   ```
   This command will return the details of the alarm named "Network ACL Changes Alarm".

4. If you want to check the state of this alarm, you can use the `--state-value` option followed by the state you want to check. For example:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --state-value "ALARM" --alarm-names "Network ACL Changes Alarm"
   ```
   This command will return the details of the alarm named "Network ACL Changes Alarm" only if it is in the "ALARM" state.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up the AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, configure your AWS credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using the AWS CLI.

2. **Create a Python Script to Fetch CloudWatch Alarms:**
   You can use the `describe_alarms` method provided by the CloudWatch client in boto3 to fetch all the alarms. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def get_cloudwatch_alarms():
       cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
       alarms = cloudwatch.describe_alarms()
       return alarms['MetricAlarms']

   alarms = get_cloudwatch_alarms()
   for alarm in alarms:
       print(alarm['AlarmName'])
   ```
   This script will print the names of all the alarms in your AWS account.

3. **Filter Alarms for Network ACL Changes:**
   Now, you need to filter out the alarms related to Network ACL changes. You can do this by checking the `MetricName` and `Namespace` fields of each alarm. Here is how you can modify the above script to do this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def get_cloudwatch_alarms():
       cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
       alarms = cloudwatch.describe_alarms()
       return alarms['MetricAlarms']

   alarms = get_cloudwatch_alarms()
   for alarm in alarms:
       if alarm['Namespace'] == 'AWS/NetworkACL' and alarm['MetricName'] == 'NetworkACLChanges':
           print(alarm['AlarmName'])
   ```
   This script will print the names of all the alarms related to Network ACL changes.

4. **Check the State of the Alarms:**
   Finally, you can check the state of these alarms to see if any changes have been made to the Network ACLs. You can do this by checking the `StateValue` field of each alarm. Here is how you can modify the above script to do this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def get_cloudwatch_alarms():
       cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
       alarms = cloudwatch.describe_alarms()
       return alarms['MetricAlarms']

   alarms = get_cloudwatch_alarms()
   for alarm in alarms:
       if alarm['Namespace'] == 'AWS/NetworkACL' and alarm['MetricName'] == 'NetworkACLChanges':
           print(f"Alarm Name: {alarm['AlarmName']}, State: {alarm['StateValue']}")
   ```
   This script will print the names and states of all the alarms related to Network ACL changes. If the state of any alarm is 'ALARM', it means that a change has been made to the Network ACLs.

<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
The "Network ACL Changes Alarm" indicates that changes have been made to the Network Access Control List (NACL) in your AWS account. To set up this alarm and monitor NACL changes, follow these steps:

1. Open the **AWS Management Console** and navigate to **CloudWatch**.
2. In the left navigation panel, select **Logs**.

3. Select the log group created for your CloudTrail trail event logs, and click **Create Metric Filter**.

4. On the **Define Logs Metric Filter** page, enter the following pattern in the **Filter Pattern** box:

```
{
    ($.eventName = CreateNetworkAcl) || ($.eventName = CreateNetworkAclEntry) || ($.eventName = DeleteNetworkAcl) ||
    ($.eventName = DeleteNetworkAclEntry) || ($.eventName = ReplaceNetworkAclEntry) || ($.eventName = ReplaceNetworkAclAssociation)
}
```

This filter will capture relevant NACL creation, update, and deletion events.

5. Review the metric filter details and click **Assign Metric**.

6. On the **Create Metric Filter and Assign a Metric** page:

   - In the **Filter Name** box, enter `NetworkACLConfigChanges`.
   - In the **Metric Namespace** box, enter `CloudTrailMetrics`.
   - In the **Metric Name** box, enter `NetworkAclEventCount`.
   - Click **Show advanced metric settings** to expand the settings, and in the **Metric Value** box, enter `1`.

7. Review the details and click **Create Filter** to finalize the metric filter.

8. After creating the filter, click **Create Alarm**.

9. In the **Create Alarm** dialog box:

   - In the **Name** field, enter a unique name, such as `NetworkACLConfigChangesAlarm`.
   - Set the alarm to trigger when the metric value is **>= 1**.
   - Under **Actions**, click **+ Notification**, and choose **State is ALARM**. Select the SNS topic to notify when the alarm triggers.

10. In the **Alarm Preview** section, set the evaluation period to **5 Minutes**, and the statistic type to **Sum**.

11. Review the alarm configuration and click **Create Alarm**.

Following these steps will ensure that you are alerted whenever a change is made to a Network ACL in your AWS account.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To set up the Network ACL Changes Alarm using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command to create a CloudWatch metric filter that monitors CloudTrail logs for Network ACL changes:

```bash
aws logs put-metric-filter \
  --region <region> \
  --log-group-name CloudTrail/CloudWatchLogGroup \
  --filter-name NetworkACLConfigChanges \
  --filter-pattern '{ ($.eventName = CreateNetworkAcl) || ($.eventName = CreateNetworkAclEntry) || ($.eventName = DeleteNetworkAcl) || ($.eventName = DeleteNetworkAclEntry) || ($.eventName = ReplaceNetworkAclEntry) || ($.eventName = ReplaceNetworkAclAssociation) }' \
  --metric-transformations metricName=NetworkAclEventCount,metricNamespace=CloudTrailMetrics,metricValue=1
```

Replace `region` with your AWS region.

2. Create a CloudWatch alarm that will trigger whenever there is a change to a Network ACL:

```
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --region <region> \
  --alarm-name NetworkACLConfigChangesAlarm \
  --alarm-description "Triggered by AWS Network ACL configuration changes." \
  --metric-name NetworkAclEventCount \
  --namespace CloudTrailMetrics \
  --statistic Sum \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold \
  --evaluation-periods 1 \
  --period 300 \
  --threshold 1 \
  --actions-enabled \
  --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:<region>:<account_id>:CloudWatchAlarmSNSTopic
```

Replace `region` with your AWS region and account_id with your AWS account ID.

By following these CLI steps, you can automate the creation of the necessary CloudWatch metric filters and alarms to monitor changes to your Network ACLs.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
The Network ACL Changes Alarm is triggered when changes are made to Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) in your AWS environment. To implement the remediation using Python, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the source of change**: Use the AWS CloudTrail service to track the source of any changes. CloudTrail logs all API calls made in your AWS account, which will help you identify who made the change and when it occurred.

2. **Review the change**: Once the source is identified, review the change to ensure it aligns with your organization's security policies and best practices.

3. **Roll back the change**: If the change was made in error or violates your security policies, use the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to roll back the change.

4. **Update NACLs**: If the change is legitimate, ensure that your NACLs are updated accordingly using the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console.

5. **Monitor future changes**: Set up monitoring to track future NACL changes and use alerts to notify you of unauthorized modifications.

Here is a Python code sample to help set up the CloudWatch Metric Filter and Alarm for monitoring NACL changes using AWS Boto3:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize clients for CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch
logs_client = boto3.client('logs', region_name='us-east-1')
cloudwatch_client = boto3.client('cloudwatch', region_name='us-east-1')

# Step 1: Create Metric Filter for Network ACL changes
logs_client.put_metric_filter(
    logGroupName='CloudTrail/CloudWatchLogGroup',
    filterName='NetworkACLConfigChanges',
    filterPattern='{ ($.eventName = CreateNetworkAcl) || ($.eventName = CreateNetworkAclEntry) || ($.eventName = DeleteNetworkAcl) || ($.eventName = DeleteNetworkAclEntry) || ($.eventName = ReplaceNetworkAclEntry) || ($.eventName = ReplaceNetworkAclAssociation) }',
    metricTransformations=[
        {
            'metricName': 'NetworkAclEventCount',
            'metricNamespace': 'CloudTrailMetrics',
            'metricValue': '1'
        }
    ]
)

# Step 2: Create CloudWatch Alarm
cloudwatch_client.put_metric_alarm(
    AlarmName='NetworkACLConfigChangesAlarm',
    AlarmDescription='Alarm triggered by AWS Network ACL configuration changes.',
    MetricName='NetworkAclEventCount',
    Namespace='CloudTrailMetrics',
    Statistic='Sum',
    Period=300,
    EvaluationPeriods=1,
    Threshold=1,
    ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold',
    ActionsEnabled=True,
    AlarmActions=[
        'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:CloudWatchAlarmSNSTopic'
    ]
)
```

This code sets up a CloudWatch metric filter to monitor for NACL changes (such as CreateNetworkAcl, DeleteNetworkAcl, etc.) by scanning CloudTrail logs. Creates a CloudWatch alarm that triggers when the metric detects a Network ACL change, sending a notification to the specified SNS topic.
