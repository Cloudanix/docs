1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.

2. In the navigation pane, click on "Alarms".

3. In the "Alarms" dashboard, you can see a list of all the alarms that have been configured. Look for the "Authorization Failures" alarm in the list. If the state of the alarm is "ALARM", it means that the metric it is monitoring has breached the threshold.

4. For more details, click on the alarm name. This will open a new page where you can see the details of the alarm, including its state, conditions, history, and the actions it is configured to perform when it changes state. You can also see a graph showing the metric data over time.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all CloudWatch alarms: Use the `describe-alarms` command to list all the alarms in your AWS account. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the alarms along with their details.

3. Filter Authorization Failures Alarm: To specifically check for Authorization Failures Alarm, you can filter the output of the above command. You can do this by using the `--query` option in the command. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --query 'MetricAlarms[?AlarmName==`Authorization Failures`]'
   ```

   This command will return the details of the alarm named 'Authorization Failures'.

4. Check the state of the alarm: To check the state of the alarm, you can use the `describe-alarm-state` command. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarm-state --alarm-name 'Authorization Failures'
   ```

   This command will return the state of the alarm. If the state is 'ALARM', it means that the alarm condition is met. If the state is 'INSUFFICIENT_DATA', it means that the alarm has just started, but it doesn't have enough data to determine the alarm state. If the state is 'OK', it means that the metric is within the defined threshold.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up the AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, configure your AWS credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using the AWS CLI.

2. **Import Boto3 and Initialize CloudWatch Client:**
   Import the boto3 library in your Python script and initialize the CloudWatch client. Here's a sample script to do this:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create CloudWatch client
   cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
   ```

3. **Get Metric Statistics:**
   Use the `get_metric_statistics` method to retrieve the data of the Authorization Failures metric. This method requires several parameters like `Namespace`, `MetricName`, `StartTime`, `EndTime`, `Period`, `Statistics`. Here's a sample script:
   ```python
   import datetime

   response = cloudwatch.get_metric_statistics(
       Namespace='AWS/Events',
       MetricName='AuthorizationFailures',
       Dimensions=[
           {
               'Name': 'RuleName',
               'Value': 'MyRule'
           },
       ],
       StartTime=datetime.datetime.utcnow() - datetime.timedelta(seconds=600),
       EndTime=datetime.datetime.utcnow(),
       Period=300,
       Statistics=[
           'SampleCount',
       ],
   )
   ```

4. **Analyze the Response:**
   The response from the `get_metric_statistics` method will contain the data points of the Authorization Failures metric. You can analyze these data points to detect any unusual activity. Here's a sample script to print the data points:
   ```python
   print(response['Datapoints'])
   ```
   If the `SampleCount` is greater than 0, it means there are authorization failures. You can set up an alert or take further actions based on your requirements.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
The "Authorization Failures" alarm in AWS CloudWatch should be configured to trigger whenever unauthorized API calls are made. To set this up using the AWS Console:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to [Amazon CloudWatch console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

3. In the left-hand menu, under **Logs**, choose **Log groups**.

4. Click on the name (link) of the log group associated with your Amazon CloudTrail trail.

5. Select the **Metric filters** tab and choose **Create metric filter**.

6. On the **Create metric filter** setup page, perform the following actions:

   - For **Step 1: Define pattern**, paste the following pattern in the Filter Pattern box:  
     `{($.errorCode = "*UnauthorizedOperation") || ($.errorCode = "AccessDenied*")}`  
     This will scan your Amazon CloudTrail logs for "AccessDenied" and "UnauthorizedOperation" events. Choose **Next**.

   - For **Step 2: Assign metric**, provide the following information:
     - In the **Filter name** box, enter a unique name for the new filter.
     - In the **Metric namespace** box, type `CloudTrailMetrics`.
     - In the **Metric name** box, type `AuthorizationFailure`.
     - In the **Metric value** box, type `1`.
     - (Optional) Choose **Count** from the Unit â€“ optional dropdown list.
     - Choose **Next** to continue.

7. On the **Metric filters** panel, select the newly created metric filter and choose **Create alarm**.

8. On the **Create alarm** setup page, perform the following actions:

   - For **Step 1: Specify metric and conditions**:

     - In the **Metric section**, select **Sum** from the Statistic list, and choose **5 minutes** from the Period dropdown list.
     - In the **Conditions section**, select **Static** as Threshold type.
     - For **Whenever AuthorizationFailure is**, select **Greater/Equal (greater than or equal to)**, and enter `1` in the configuration box to trigger the CloudWatch alarm.
     - Choose **Next**.

   - For **Step 2: Configure actions**, define the alarm state that will trigger the CloudWatch alarm action:

     - Select **In alarm** under Alarm state trigger.
     - Choose **Select an existing SNS topic** and select the name of the SNS topic created at Step 1.
     - Choose **Next**.

The Authorization Failures alarm in AWS can also be created and managed using the AWS CLI. Follow these steps:

1. Create the required CloudWatch metric filter and associate it with your Amazon CloudTrail trail. The pattern used will scan for `AccessDenied` and `UnauthorizedOperation` events.

Run this command to create the metric filter:

```bash
aws logs put-metric-filter \
   --region us-east-1 \
   --log-group-name cc-project5-log-group \
   --filter-name AWSCloudAuthorizationFailure \
   --filter-pattern '{($.errorCode = "*UnauthorizedOperation") || ($.errorCode = "AccessDenied*")}' \
   --metric-transformations metricName=AuthorizationFailure,metricNamespace=CloudTrailMetrics,metricValue=1
```

2. Create the CloudWatch alarm to monitor the authorization failures:

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --alarm-name "AWSAuthorizationFailureAlarm" \
  --alarm-description "Triggered when unauthorized AWS API calls are made" \
  --metric-name AuthorizationFailure \
  --namespace CloudTrailMetrics \
  --statistic Sum \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold \
  --evaluation-periods 1 \
  --period 300 \
  --threshold 1 \
  --actions-enabled \
  --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:cc-cloud-alert-sns-topic
```

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
The "Authorization Failures" alarm in AWS CloudWatch is triggered when there are failed attempts to access AWS resources due to insufficient permissions. To remediate this issue using Python, follow these steps:

1. First, set up the required metric filter and alarm in CloudWatch using the Boto3 library:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize clients for CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch
logs_client = boto3.client('logs')
cw_client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

# Create metric filter
logs_client.put_metric_filter(
    logGroupName='cc-project5-log-group',
    filterName='AWSCloudAuthorizationFailure',
    filterPattern='{($.errorCode = "*UnauthorizedOperation") || ($.errorCode = "AccessDenied*")}',
    metricTransformations=[
        {
            'metricName': 'AuthorizationFailure',
            'metricNamespace': 'CloudTrailMetrics',
            'metricValue': '1'
        }
    ]
)

# Create CloudWatch alarm
cw_client.put_metric_alarm(
    AlarmName='AWSAuthorizationFailureAlarm',
    AlarmDescription='Triggered when unauthorized AWS API calls are made',
    MetricName='AuthorizationFailure',
    Namespace='CloudTrailMetrics',
    Statistic='Sum',
    Period=300,
    EvaluationPeriods=1,
    Threshold=1,
    ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold',
    AlarmActions=['arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:cc-cloud-alert-sns-topic']
)
```

2. This Python script will automatically set up the metric filter and alarm to monitor any authorization failures across your AWS account.
