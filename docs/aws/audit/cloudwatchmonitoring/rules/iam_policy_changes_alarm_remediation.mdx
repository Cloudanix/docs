### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.

2. In the navigation pane, click on "Alarms".

3. In the "Alarms" dashboard, you can see all the alarms that have been set up. Look for the IAM Policy Changes Alarm. If it's in the "OK" state, it means there are no recent changes. If it's in the "ALARM" state, it means a change has been detected.

4. To view more details about the alarm, click on the alarm name. In the details pane, you can see the metric name, the threshold that triggers the alarm, the evaluation period, and other information. You can also see the history of the alarm, which shows when the alarm state changed and why.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List existing CloudWatch alarms: You can use the `describe-alarms` command to list all the existing alarms in your AWS account. This command will return a list of all the alarms along with their details. Here is the command:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms
   ```
   Look for the IAM Policy Changes Alarm in the list. If it exists, it means it has been set up correctly.

3. Check the state of the alarm: You can check the state of the IAM Policy Changes Alarm by using the `describe-alarm-state` command. Replace `<alarm-name>` with the name of your IAM Policy Changes Alarm:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarm-state --alarm-name <alarm-name>
   ```
   This command will return the state of the alarm. If the state is `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, it means the alarm has not been triggered yet. If the state is `ALARM`, it means the alarm has been triggered.

4. Check the alarm history: You can check the history of the IAM Policy Changes Alarm by using the `describe-alarm-history` command. Replace `<alarm-name>` with the name of your IAM Policy Changes Alarm:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarm-history --alarm-name <alarm-name>
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the times the alarm has been triggered. If the alarm has been triggered recently, it means there have been changes to your IAM policies.

#### Using Python

1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up the AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, configure your AWS credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using the AWS CLI.

2. **Create a Python Script to Fetch CloudWatch Alarms:**
   You can use the `describe_alarms` method provided by the CloudWatch client in boto3 to fetch all the alarms. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def get_cloudwatch_alarms():
       client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
       response = client.describe_alarms()
       return response['MetricAlarms']

   alarms = get_cloudwatch_alarms()
   for alarm in alarms:
       print(alarm['AlarmName'])
   ```
   This script will print the names of all the alarms configured in CloudWatch.

3. **Filter IAM Policy Changes Alarms:**
   Now, you need to filter out the alarms related to IAM policy changes. You can do this by checking the `MetricName` and `Namespace` of each alarm. Here is the updated script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def get_cloudwatch_alarms():
       client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
       response = client.describe_alarms()
       return response['MetricAlarms']

   alarms = get_cloudwatch_alarms()
   for alarm in alarms:
       if alarm['Namespace'] == 'AWS/IAM' and alarm['MetricName'] == 'PolicyChanges':
           print(alarm['AlarmName'])
   ```
   This script will print the names of the alarms that are monitoring IAM policy changes.

4. **Check the State of the Alarms:**
   Finally, you can check the state of these alarms to see if any IAM policy changes have occurred. You can do this by checking the `StateValue` of each alarm. Here is the final script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def get_cloudwatch_alarms():
       client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
       response = client.describe_alarms()
       return response['MetricAlarms']

   alarms = get_cloudwatch_alarms()
   for alarm in alarms:
       if alarm['Namespace'] == 'AWS/IAM' and alarm['MetricName'] == 'PolicyChanges':
           print(f"Alarm Name: {alarm['AlarmName']}, State: {alarm['StateValue']}")
   ```
   This script will print the names and states of the alarms that are monitoring IAM policy changes. If the state of any alarm is 'ALARM', it means that an IAM policy change has occurred.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. **Configure CloudTrail to Deliver Logs to CloudWatch Logs**:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console.
   - Open the CloudTrail service.
   - Select your trail.
   - Click on "Edit".
   - In the "CloudWatch Logs" section, select an existing log group or create a new one.
   - Click "Save changes".

2. **Create Metric Filter and Alarm**:
   - Go to the CloudWatch service in the AWS Management Console.
   - In the left-hand navigation pane, choose "Logs" and then select the log group you configured in CloudTrail.
   - Click on "Create metric filter".
   - Define a filter pattern that matches IAM policy changes. For example, you might use a pattern like `{ $.eventSource = "iam.amazonaws.com" && $.eventName = "AttachRolePolicy" }`.
   - Click "Assign metric".
   - Give your metric a name like `IAMPolicyChangesEventCount`.
   - Click "Create filter".
   - Once your filter is created, you can set up an alarm based on this metric.

#### Using CLI

1. **Create Metric Filter**:
   ```bash
   aws logs put-metric-filter \
     --log-group-name "YOUR_LOG_GROUP_NAME" \
     --filter-name "IAMPolicyChangesFilter" \
     --filter-pattern '{ $.eventSource = "iam.amazonaws.com" && $.eventName = "AttachRolePolicy" }' \
     --metric-transformations "metricName=IAMPolicyChangesEventCount,metricNamespace=CloudTrailMetrics,metricValue=1"
   ```
   Replace `"YOUR_LOG_GROUP_NAME"` with the name of your CloudTrail log group.

2. **Create CloudWatch Alarm** (optional):
   Use the `put-metric-alarm` command to create an alarm based on the metric you created.

#### Using Python

```python
import boto3

cloudwatch_logs = boto3.client('logs')
cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

# Create Metric Filter
response = cloudwatch_logs.put_metric_filter(
    logGroupName='YOUR_LOG_GROUP_NAME',
    filterName='IAMPolicyChangesFilter',
    filterPattern='{ $.eventSource = "iam.amazonaws.com" && $.eventName = "AttachRolePolicy" }',
    metricTransformations=[
        {
            'metricName': 'IAMPolicyChangesEventCount',
            'metricNamespace': 'CloudTrailMetrics',
            'metricValue': 1
        }
    ]
)

# Create CloudWatch Alarm (optional)
# You can use cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm() to create an alarm based on the metric
```

Replace `"YOUR_LOG_GROUP_NAME"` with the name of your CloudTrail log group.

These steps should help you set up the `IAMPolicyChangesEventCount` metric in CloudWatch using the AWS Console, AWS CLI, or Python script. Remember to adjust the configuration according to your specific use case and environment.
