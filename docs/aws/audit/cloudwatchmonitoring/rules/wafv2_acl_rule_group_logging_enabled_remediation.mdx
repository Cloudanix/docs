1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS WAF & Shield service.

2. In the navigation pane, select "WebACLs". This will display a list of all your WebACLs.

3. Click on the name of the WebACL that you want to check. This will open the details page for that WebACL.

4. In the details page, look for the "Logging" section. If logging is enabled, you will see a "Logging configuration" with the name of the CloudWatch Logs group where logs are being sent. If this section is not present or if it says "Logging is off", then logging is not enabled for this WebACL Rule Group.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to list all the available WebACLs in your AWS account. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws wafv2 list-web-acls --scope REGIONAL
```
This command will return a list of WebACLs in your account. Note down the ARN of the WebACL you want to check.

2. Next, you need to get the details of the specific WebACL. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws wafv2 get-web-acl --scope REGIONAL --arn "arn:aws:wafv2:region:account-id:regional/webacl/WebACLName/ID"
```
Replace "arn:aws:wafv2:region:account-id:regional/webacl/WebACLName/ID" with the ARN of your WebACL. This command will return the details of the WebACL.

3. Now, you need to check if the logging configuration is enabled for this WebACL. In the output of the previous command, look for the "LoggingConfiguration" field. If this field is present and the "LogDestinationConfigs" field inside it is not empty, then logging is enabled for this WebACL.

4. If you want to check the details of the logging configuration, you can use the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws wafv2 describe-logging-configuration --resource-arn "arn:aws:wafv2:region:account-id:regional/webacl/WebACLName/ID"
```
Replace "arn:aws:wafv2:region:account-id:regional/webacl/WebACLName/ID" with the ARN of your WebACL. This command will return the details of the logging configuration for this WebACL.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if WAFv2 WebACL Rule Group Logging is enabled in Cloud Watch using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Set up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to set up Boto3. Install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. **Create a Python script to list all WebACLs:**
   Use the `list_web_acls` method to get a list of all WebACLs. Here's a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('wafv2')

   response = client.list_web_acls(
       Scope='REGIONAL',
   )

   for webacl in response['WebACLs']:
       print(webacl['Name'])
   ```
   This script will print the names of all WebACLs in the region.

3. **Create a Python script to get the details of each WebACL:**
   Use the `get_web_acl` method to get the details of each WebACL. Here's a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('wafv2')

   response = client.get_web_acl(
       Name='string',
       Scope='REGIONAL',
       Id='string',
   )

   print(response['WebACL'])
   ```
   Replace 'string' with the name and ID of the WebACL you want to check. This script will print the details of the specified WebACL.

4. **Check if logging is enabled:**
   In the details of the WebACL, look for the `LoggingConfiguration` field. If this field is present and the `LogDestinationConfigs` field is not empty, then logging is enabled. Here's a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('wafv2')

   response = client.get_web_acl(
       Name='string',
       Scope='REGIONAL',
       Id='string',
   )

   if 'LoggingConfiguration' in response['WebACL']:
       if response['WebACL']['LoggingConfiguration']['LogDestinationConfigs']:
           print('Logging is enabled')
       else:
           print('Logging is not enabled')
   else:
       print('Logging is not enabled')
   ```
   Replace 'string' with the name and ID of the WebACL you want to check. This script will print whether logging is enabled for the specified WebACL.
