Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the Console Sign-in Failures Alarm for AWS:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the CloudWatch service.
3. Click on "Alarms" in the left-hand menu.
4. Locate the Console Sign-in Failures Alarm that you want to remediate and click on it.
5. Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Disable Alarm".
6. Confirm that you want to disable the alarm by clicking "Yes, Disable".
7. Once the alarm is disabled, you can investigate the cause of the sign-in failures and take appropriate action to remediate the issue.

Note: Disabling the alarm will stop notifications from being sent, but it will not fix the underlying issue causing the sign-in failures. You will need to investigate and address the root cause of the issue to prevent future failures.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The Console Sign-in Failures alarm is triggered when there are too many failed sign-in attempts to the AWS Management Console. To remediate this issue in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to get the current status of the CloudWatch alarm:

```
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names ConsoleSigninFailures
```

3. If the alarm is in the ALARM state, it means that there have been too many failed sign-in attempts. To reset the alarm, run the following command:

```
aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state --alarm-name ConsoleSigninFailures --state-value OK --state-reason "Manually reset by administrator"
```

4. To prevent this issue from happening again in the future, you can configure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to enforce stronger password policies, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), and restrict access to the AWS Management Console based on IP address.

5. To enforce stronger password policies, you can create an IAM password policy that requires users to choose strong passwords, such as those that contain a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

6. To enable MFA, you can require users to use a physical or virtual MFA device when signing in to the AWS Management Console.

7. To restrict access to the AWS Management Console based on IP address, you can create an AWS WAF web ACL that blocks requests from IP addresses that are not on a whitelist.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the Console Sign-in Failures Alarm in AWS using Python, you can follow the steps below:

1. First, you need to identify the IAM user or role that is causing the sign-in failures. You can do this by going to the AWS CloudTrail console and filtering the events by the event name "ConsoleLogin". This will give you a list of all the sign-in events along with the username or role that was used.

2. Once you have identified the user or role, you can check their permissions to ensure that they have the necessary permissions to access the AWS resources they need. You can do this by using the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console or by using the AWS CLI or SDKs.

3. If the user or role has the necessary permissions, you can check if their login credentials are correct and if they are not experiencing any issues with their MFA device. You can do this by contacting the user or role and asking them to verify their login credentials and MFA device.

4. If the user or role is still experiencing sign-in failures, you can reset their password or MFA device by using the AWS IAM console or by using the AWS CLI or SDKs.

5. Finally, you can monitor the sign-in events using AWS CloudWatch and set up alerts to notify you if there are any further sign-in failures.

Here is an example Python code that you can use to reset the MFA device for an IAM user:

```python
import boto3

# Replace with the username of the IAM user
USERNAME = 'my-iam-user'

# Create an IAM client
client = boto3.client('iam')

# Get the IAM user
user = client.get_user(UserName=USERNAME)

# Reset the MFA device for the user
client.deactivate_mfa_device(UserName=USERNAME, SerialNumber=user['User']['MfaDevices'][0]['SerialNumber'])
client.enable_mfa_device(UserName=USERNAME, SerialNumber=user['User']['MfaDevices'][0]['SerialNumber'], AuthenticationCode1='123456', AuthenticationCode2='654321')
```

Note: This code assumes that the IAM user has only one MFA device. If the user has multiple MFA devices, you will need to modify the code to reset the correct device.
