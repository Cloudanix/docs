<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all the WebACLs: Use the following command to list all the WebACLs in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws wafv2 list-web-acls --scope REGIONAL
   ```
   This command will return a list of WebACLs. Note down the ARN of the WebACL for which you want to check the logging configuration.

3. Get WebACL details: Use the following command to get the details of a specific WebACL:

   ```
   aws wafv2 get-web-acl --scope REGIONAL --arn "arn:aws:wafv2:region:account-id:regional/webacl/WebACLName/ID"
   ```
   Replace "arn:aws:wafv2:region:account-id:regional/webacl/WebACLName/ID" with the ARN of your WebACL. This command will return the details of the WebACL including its logging configuration.

4. Check the logging configuration: In the output of the previous command, look for the "LoggingConfiguration" field. If this field is present and its "LogDestinationConfigs" field is not empty, then WAF logging is enabled. If the "LoggingConfiguration" field is not present or its "LogDestinationConfigs" field is empty, then WAF logging is not enabled.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if WAF Logging is enabled in CloudWatch using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Setup AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to set up Boto3. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating the files ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```
   ```
   [default]
   region=us-east-1
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script to List WAF WebACLs:**
   You can use the `list_web_acls` method to list all your WAF WebACLs. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('wafv2')

   response = client.list_web_acls(
       Scope='REGIONAL'
   )

   print(response)
   ```
   This script will print all your WAF WebACLs in the console.

3. **Create a Python Script to Get WebACL Logging Configuration:**
   You can use the `get_logging_configuration` method to get the logging configuration of a WebACL. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('wafv2')

   response = client.get_logging_configuration(
       ResourceArn='arn:aws:wafv2:region:account-id:webacl/name/id'
   )

   print(response)
   ```
   Replace 'arn:aws:wafv2:region:account-id:webacl/name/id' with the ARN of your WebACL. This script will print the logging configuration of the specified WebACL in the console.

4. **Check if Logging is Enabled:**
   The `get_logging_configuration` method returns a dictionary that contains the logging configuration of the specified WebACL. If the 'LoggingConfiguration' key is present in the dictionary, then logging is enabled. If it's not present, then logging is not enabled. You can add this check to your script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('wafv2')

   response = client.get_logging_configuration(
       ResourceArn='arn:aws:wafv2:region:account-id:webacl/name/id'
   )

   if 'LoggingConfiguration' in response:
       print('Logging is enabled.')
   else:
       print('Logging is not enabled.')
   ```
   This script will print whether logging is enabled or not for the specified WebACL.
