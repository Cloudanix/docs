### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.

2. In the navigation pane, click on "Alarms".

3. In the "Alarms" dashboard, you can see all the alarms that have been set up. Look for the AWS Organizations Changes Alarm. If it's in the "OK" state, it means there are no misconfigurations. If it's in the "ALARM" state, it means the changes have been detected.

4. For more details about the alarm, click on the alarm name. In the details pane, you can see the metrics and conditions that are associated with the alarm. This can help you understand what specific changes have triggered the alarm.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure to configure it with the necessary access keys and region.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the `describe-alarms` command to list the alarms in your AWS account. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names "my alarm name"
   ```
   Replace "my alarm name" with the name of your alarm. This command will return a JSON object with the details of the alarm.

3. To check if the alarm is triggered due to AWS Organizations changes, you need to look at the `MetricName` and `Namespace` fields in the returned JSON. The `MetricName` should be `OrganizationsChangesDetected` and the `Namespace` should be `AWS/Config`.

4. If you want to check the state of the alarm, you can use the `state-value` option with the `describe-alarms` command. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --state-value "ALARM"
   ```
   This command will return all the alarms that are currently in the ALARM state. You can look for your alarm in the returned list to check if it is triggered.

#### Using Python

1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up the AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, configure your AWS credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using the AWS CLI.

2. **Import Boto3 and Initialize CloudWatch Client:**
   Import the boto3 library in your Python script and initialize the CloudWatch client. Here's a sample script to do this:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create CloudWatch client
   cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
   ```

3. **List All Alarms:**
   Use the `describe_alarms` function to list all the alarms. This function returns all the alarm details including the alarm name, state, and other details.
   ```python
   # List alarms of insufficient data through the pagination interface
   paginator = cloudwatch.get_paginator('describe_alarms')

   for response in paginator.paginate(StateValue='INSUFFICIENT_DATA'):
       print(response['MetricAlarms'])
   ```
   This script will print all the alarms that are in the 'INSUFFICIENT_DATA' state.

4. **Check for AWS Organizations Changes Alarm:**
   Now, iterate over the alarms and check if the 'AWS Organizations Changes' alarm exists and its state. If the alarm is not in the 'OK' state, it means there is a misconfiguration.
   ```python
   for alarm in response['MetricAlarms']:
       if alarm['AlarmName'] == 'AWS Organizations Changes':
           print(f"Alarm {alarm['AlarmName']} is in {alarm['StateValue']} state")
   ```
   This script will print the state of the 'AWS Organizations Changes' alarm. If the alarm is in 'ALARM' state, it means there are changes in AWS Organizations that need attention.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

The AWS Organizations Changes Alarm is triggered when there is a change in the AWS Organizations structure, such as adding or removing accounts, or changing the root email address. To remediate this misconfiguration, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the CloudWatch service.

3. Click on "Alarms" in the left-hand menu.

4. Find the "AWS Organizations Changes Alarm" in the list of alarms.

5. Click on the alarm to view its details.

6. Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Disable Alarm Actions".

7. Click "Save" to disable the alarm.

This will stop the alarm from being triggered when there is a change in the AWS Organizations structure. However, it is important to regularly review and update your AWS Organizations structure to ensure that it is properly configured and secure.

#### Using CLI

The AWS Organizations Changes Alarm is triggered when there are changes made to the AWS Organizations service. To remediate this issue, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Log in to your AWS account using AWS CLI.

2. Run the following command to create an SNS topic that will be used to send notifications when the alarm is triggered:

```
aws sns create-topic --name <topic-name>
```

3. Run the following command to create a new CloudWatch alarm:

```
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name <alarm-name> --alarm-description "AWS Organizations Changes Alarm" --metric-name Organizations --namespace AWS/Organizations --statistic Sum --period 300 --evaluation-periods 1 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --dimensions Name=Operation,Value=All --alarm-actions <sns-topic-arn>
```

Replace the `<alarm-name>` with a name of your choice, `<sns-topic-arn>` with the ARN of the SNS topic created in step 2.

4. Verify that the alarm has been created successfully by running the following command:

```
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names <alarm-name>
```

This should return the details of the alarm that you just created.

5. Finally, you can test the alarm by making a change to your AWS Organizations service. If the alarm is triggered, you should receive a notification via the SNS topic created in step 2.

By following these steps, you can remediate the AWS Organizations Changes Alarm issue using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

The AWS Organizations Changes Alarm is triggered when there are changes made to the AWS Organizations service. To remediate this issue using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an SNS topic: You can create an SNS topic using the AWS SDK for Python (boto3). This topic will be used to send notifications whenever there is a change in the AWS Organizations service.

```python
import boto3

sns = boto3.client('sns')

response = sns.create_topic(Name='organizations-changes')

topic_arn = response['TopicArn']
```

2. Create a CloudWatch Events rule: You can create a CloudWatch Events rule to monitor changes to the AWS Organizations service. This rule will trigger an AWS Lambda function whenever there is a change.

```python
import boto3

events = boto3.client('events')

response = events.put_rule(
    Name='organizations-changes',
    EventPattern='{"source": ["aws.organizations"]}'
)

rule_arn = response['RuleArn']
```

3. Create an AWS Lambda function: You can create an AWS Lambda function using the AWS SDK for Python (boto3). This function will be triggered by the CloudWatch Events rule and will send a notification to the SNS topic.

```python
import boto3

lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')

response = lambda_client.create_function(
    FunctionName='organizations-changes',
    Runtime='python3.7',
    Role='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/lambda-role',
    Handler='lambda_function.lambda_handler',
    Code={
        'ZipFile': b'bytes',
    },
    Environment={
        'Variables': {
            'SNS_TOPIC_ARN': topic_arn,
        }
    },
)

function_arn = response['FunctionArn']
```

4. Add permissions to the Lambda function: You need to add permissions to the Lambda function to allow it to publish messages to the SNS topic.

```python
import boto3

lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')

response = lambda_client.add_permission(
    FunctionName='organizations-changes',
    StatementId='sns-publish',
    Action='lambda:InvokeFunction',
    Principal='sns.amazonaws.com',
    SourceArn=topic_arn,
)
```

5. Create a CloudWatch alarm: You can create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the SNS topic. This alarm will be triggered whenever a message is published to the SNS topic.

```python
import boto3

cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

response = cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
    AlarmName='organizations-changes',
    AlarmActions=[topic_arn],
    MetricName='NumberOfMessagesPublished',
    Namespace='AWS/SNS',
    Statistic='Sum',
    Period=60,
    EvaluationPeriods=1,
    Threshold=1,
    ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold',
)
```

These steps will help you remediate the AWS Organizations Changes Alarm issue using Python.
