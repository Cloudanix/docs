<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent WAF Global Rule Groups from being empty in AWS using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a WAF Rule Group:**
   First, create a WAF Rule Group if you don't already have one. This will serve as a container for your rules.

   ```sh
   aws wafv2 create-rule-group \
       --name "MyRuleGroup" \
       --scope "CLOUDFRONT" \
       --capacity 100 \
       --region us-east-1 \
       --rules '[]' \
       --visibility-config SampledRequestsEnabled=true,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=true,MetricName="MyRuleGroupMetric"
   ```

2. **Create a WAF Rule:**
   Create a WAF rule that you will add to your rule group. This example creates a simple rate-based rule.

   ```sh
   aws wafv2 create-rule \
       --name "RateLimitRule" \
       --scope "CLOUDFRONT" \
       --region us-east-1 \
       --statement '{"RateBasedStatement":{"Limit":2000,"AggregateKeyType":"IP"}}' \
       --visibility-config SampledRequestsEnabled=true,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=true,MetricName="RateLimitRuleMetric"
   ```

3. **Update the Rule Group to Include the Rule:**
   Add the created rule to your rule group to ensure it is not empty.

   ```sh
   aws wafv2 update-rule-group \
       --name "MyRuleGroup" \
       --scope "CLOUDFRONT" \
       --region us-east-1 \
       --rules '[{"Name":"RateLimitRule","Priority":1,"Statement":{"RateBasedStatement":{"Limit":2000,"AggregateKeyType":"IP"}},"Action":{"Block":{}},"VisibilityConfig":{"SampledRequestsEnabled":true,"CloudWatchMetricsEnabled":true,"MetricName":"RateLimitRuleMetric"}}]' \
       --visibility-config SampledRequestsEnabled=true,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=true,MetricName="MyRuleGroupMetric"
   ```

4. **Associate the Rule Group with a Web ACL:**
   Finally, associate the rule group with a Web ACL to apply the rules.

   ```sh
   aws wafv2 associate-web-acl \
       --web-acl-arn "arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/MyWebACL" \
       --resource-arn "arn:aws:cloudfront::123456789012:distribution/EDFDVBD6EXAMPLE"
   ```

By following these steps, you ensure that your WAF Global Rule Groups are not empty, thus preventing the misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent WAF Global Rule Groups from being empty in AWS using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here are the steps to ensure that your WAF Global Rule Groups are not empty:

1. **Install Boto3 Library**:
   Ensure you have the Boto3 library installed. If not, you can install it using pip.
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**:
   Initialize the Boto3 client for WAF.
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('waf')
   ```

3. **List Rule Groups**:
   Fetch the list of all WAF Global Rule Groups.
   ```python
   response = client.list_rule_groups()
   rule_groups = response['RuleGroups']
   ```

4. **Check and Add Rules to Empty Rule Groups**:
   Iterate through each rule group and check if it is empty. If it is, add a default rule to it.
   ```python
   for rule_group in rule_groups:
       rule_group_id = rule_group['RuleGroupId']
       
       # Get the details of the rule group
       rule_group_details = client.get_rule_group(RuleGroupId=rule_group_id)
       rules = rule_group_details['RuleGroup']['Rules']
       
       # Check if the rule group is empty
       if not rules:
           # Add a default rule to the rule group
           default_rule = {
               'Action': {'Type': 'BLOCK'},
               'Priority': 1,
               'RuleId': 'example-rule-id',  # Replace with a valid RuleId
               'Type': 'REGULAR'
           }
           
           # Update the rule group with the default rule
           client.update_rule_group(
               RuleGroupId=rule_group_id,
               Updates=[
                   {
                       'Action': 'INSERT',
                       'ActivatedRule': default_rule
                   }
               ],
               ChangeToken=client.get_change_token()['ChangeToken']
           )
           print(f"Added default rule to rule group {rule_group_id}")
```

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Install Boto3 Library**: Ensure Boto3 is installed.
2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**: Set up the WAF client.
3. **List Rule Groups**: Retrieve all WAF Global Rule Groups.
4. **Check and Add Rules to Empty Rule Groups**: Verify if rule groups are empty and add a default rule if necessary.

This script ensures that no WAF Global Rule Group remains empty by adding a default rule if it finds any empty rule groups. Make sure to replace `'example-rule-id'` with a valid RuleId that you have created or intend to use.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all the WebACLs: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the WebACLs in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws wafv2 list-web-acls --scope REGIONAL
   ```
   This command will return a list of WebACLs along with their Ids and ARNs.

3. Get the details of each WebACL: For each WebACL, use the following AWS CLI command to get its details:

   ```
   aws wafv2 get-web-acl --scope REGIONAL --id `<WebACLId>` --name `<WebACLName>` --region `<Region>`
   ```
   Replace `<WebACLId>`, `<WebACLName>`, and `<Region>` with the actual Id, Name, and Region of the WebACL. This command will return the details of the WebACL including its rules.

4. Check if the Global Rule Group is empty: In the output of the previous command, look for the `Rules` field. If the `Rules` field is empty or does not contain a `RuleGroupReferenceStatement`, then the Global Rule Group is empty.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if WAF Global Rule Groups are not empty in AWS CloudWatch using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Set up your environment:**
   Before you start, make sure you have Python and Boto3 installed in your environment. You also need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by using the AWS CLI and running `aws configure`.

2. **Import necessary libraries and create a WAF client:**
   In your Python script, you need to import Boto3 and create a WAF client. Here's how you can do it:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create WAF client
   waf = boto3.client('waf')
   ```

3. **List all the WebACLs:**
   You can use the `list_web_acls()` function to get all the WebACLs. Here's how you can do it:

   ```python
   # List all WebACLs
   web_acls = waf.list_web_acls(Limit=100)
   ```

4. **Check if Rule Groups are not empty:**
   For each WebACL, you can get the details using `get_web_acl()` function and check if the Rule Groups are not empty. Here's how you can do it:

   ```python
   # Check if Rule Groups are not empty
   for web_acl in web_acls['WebACLs']:
       web_acl_id = web_acl['WebACLId']
       web_acl_details = waf.get_web_acl(WebACLId=web_acl_id)
       rules = web_acl_details['WebACL']['Rules']
       if not rules:
           print(f"WebACL {web_acl_id} has no rules.")
   ```

This script will print the IDs of all WebACLs that have no rules. If the script doesn't print anything, it means all your WAF Global Rule Groups are not empty.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rule Groups in AWS CloudWatch using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **List WAF Global Rule Groups**: First, list all the WAF Global Rule Groups to identify the empty ones. Run the following AWS CLI command:
   ```
   aws wafv2 list-available-managed-rule-groups --scope CLOUDWATCH_METRICS
   ```

2. **Identify Empty Rule Groups**: Look for any rule groups with an empty list of rules. Note down the ARN of the empty rule group that you want to remediate.

3. **Update Rule Group**: To remediate the empty rule group, you need to update the rule group with at least one rule. You can add a managed rule or a custom rule to the rule group. Run the following AWS CLI command to update the rule group:
   ```
   aws wafv2 update-managed-rule-set-version --name <rule-group-name> --id <rule-group-id> --lock-token <lock-token> --recommended-version <version> --rules-action <action> --scope CLOUDWATCH_METRICS
   ```

   - Replace `<rule-group-name>` with the name of the rule group.
   - Replace `<rule-group-id>` with the ID of the rule group.
   - Replace `<lock-token>` with the lock token of the rule group.
   - Replace `<version>` with the version of the rule set.
   - Replace `<action>` with the action to take on the rules (e.g., ALLOW, BLOCK).

4. **Verify Update**: After updating the rule group, verify that the rule group is no longer empty by listing the rules in the rule group:
   ```
   aws wafv2 list-managed-rules --scope CLOUDWATCH_METRICS --id <rule-group-id>
   ```

5. **Monitor Changes**: Monitor the CloudWatch metrics to ensure that the WAF Global Rule Groups are no longer empty and are actively protecting your resources.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rule Groups in AWS CloudWatch using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To associate a Global WebACL with a Web Application Firewall (WAF) using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Below is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Boto3**: Make sure you have Boto3 installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up Boto3 Credentials**: Ensure that you have set up your AWS credentials for Boto3 to access your AWS account. You can set up your credentials using AWS CLI or environment variables.

3. **Write Python Code**: Use the following Python code to associate a Global WebACL with a WAF:

```python
import boto3

def associate_global_webacl_to_waf(web_acl_arn, waf_name):
    # Initialize the WAF client
    wafv2_client = boto3.client('wafv2')

    # Get the ARN of the resource associated with the WAF
    waf_resource_response = wafv2_client.get_web_acl(
        Name=waf_name
    )
    waf_resource_arn = waf_resource_response['WebACL']['ARN']

    # Associate the Global WebACL with the WAF
    response = wafv2_client.associate_web_acl(
        WebACLArn=web_acl_arn,
        ResourceArn=waf_resource_arn
    )

    print("Global WebACL associated with WAF successfully.")

def main():
    # Specify the ARN of the Global WebACL
    web_acl_arn = 'arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleGlobalWebACL'

    # Specify the name of the WAF to associate with
    waf_name = 'ExampleWAF'

    # Associate Global WebACL with WAF
    associate_global_webacl_to_waf(web_acl_arn, waf_name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Replace `'arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleGlobalWebACL'` with the ARN of your Global WebACL, and `'ExampleWAF'` with the name of the WAF you want to associate with. 

4. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script. Upon successful execution, the Global WebACL will be associated with the specified WAF.

This script will use Boto3 to call the `associate_web_acl` method of the WAFv2 client, passing in the ARNs of the Global WebACL and the WAF resource to perform the association.
