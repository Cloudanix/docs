### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS WAF & Shield service.

2. In the navigation pane, select "WebACLs". This will display a list of all your WebACLs.

3. Select the WebACL that you want to check. This will open the details page for that WebACL.

4. In the details page, check the "Rules" section. If the section is empty, it means that the WAF Global Rules are empty. If there are rules listed, it means that the WAF Global Rules are not empty.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all the WebACLs: Use the following command to list all the WebACLs in your account.

   ```
   aws wafv2 list-web-acls --scope REGIONAL
   ```

   This command will return a list of WebACLs. Note down the ARN of the WebACL you want to check.

3. Get the WebACL: Use the following command to get the details of the WebACL.

   ```
   aws wafv2 get-web-acl --scope REGIONAL --arn "arn:aws:wafv2:region:account-id:regional/webacl/WebACLName/ID"
   ```

   Replace "arn:aws:wafv2:region:account-id:regional/webacl/WebACLName/ID" with the ARN of the WebACL you noted down in the previous step. This command will return the details of the WebACL.

4. Check the rules: In the output of the previous command, look for the "Rules" field. If this field is empty, then the WAF Global Rules are empty. If it's not empty, then there are some rules defined.

#### Using Python

To check if WAF Global Rules are not empty in AWS CloudWatch using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Set up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. **Create a Python script to list all WAF Global Rules:**
   Use the `list_web_acls` method to retrieve all the WebACLs. Then, for each WebACL, use the `get_web_acl` method to retrieve the rules. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('wafv2')

   response = client.list_web_acls(Scope='CLOUDFRONT')

   for web_acl in response['WebACLs']:
       web_acl_id = web_acl['Id']
       web_acl_response = client.get_web_acl(Id=web_acl_id, Scope='CLOUDFRONT')
       rules = web_acl_response['WebACL']['Rules']
       print(f'WebACL ID: {web_acl_id}, Rules: {rules}')
   ```

3. **Check if the rules are empty:**
   In the script above, `rules` is a list that contains the rules for each WebACL. You can check if this list is empty to determine if the WAF Global Rules are empty. Here is how you can modify the script to print a message if the rules are empty:

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('wafv2')

   response = client.list_web_acls(Scope='CLOUDFRONT')

   for web_acl in response['WebACLs']:
       web_acl_id = web_acl['Id']
       web_acl_response = client.get_web_acl(Id=web_acl_id, Scope='CLOUDFRONT')
       rules = web_acl_response['WebACL']['Rules']
       if not rules:
           print(f'WebACL ID: {web_acl_id} has no rules.')
       else:
           print(f'WebACL ID: {web_acl_id}, Rules: {rules}')
   ```

4. **Run the script:**
   Finally, run the script using a Python interpreter. If any of the WebACLs have no rules, the script will print a message indicating this.

Please note that you need to replace `'your_access_key'` and `'your_secret_key'` with your actual AWS access key and secret key. Also, the script assumes that you are checking the rules for WebACLs that are used with Amazon CloudFront (Scope='CLOUDFRONT'). If you are using WebACLs with AWS WAF Regional (for use with Application Load Balancer, Amazon API Gateway, and AWS AppSync), you should replace 'CLOUDFRONT' with 'REGIONAL'.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rules in AWS CloudWatch using the AWS Management Console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Navigate to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/) and log in using your credentials.

2. **Go to AWS WAF Service**: Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the page, search for "WAF & Shield" under the Security, Identity, & Compliance section, and click on it.

3. **Select the AWS WAF Web ACL**: In the AWS WAF & Shield console, locate and click on the Web ACLs option on the left-hand side menu.

4. **Choose the Web ACL**: Select the Web ACL that you want to update by clicking on its name.

5. **Edit the Web ACL**: In the Web ACL details page, click on the "Edit" button to make changes to the Web ACL configuration.

6. **Add Global Rules**: Scroll down to the Rules section of the Web ACL configuration. If the Global Rules section is empty, click on the "Add rules" button to add new global rules.

7. **Configure Global Rules**: In the Add rules dialog box, configure the necessary rules for your Web ACL. You can add rules based on IP addresses, country, request headers, or other criteria to protect your web applications.

8. **Save Changes**: After adding the required global rules, click on the "Add" or "Save" button to save the changes to the Web ACL.

9. **Review Changes**: Review the updated Web ACL configuration to ensure that the Global Rules are no longer empty.

10. **Test the Web ACL**: Test the updated Web ACL to verify that the global rules are effectively protecting your web applications.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rules in AWS CloudWatch using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of WAF Global Rules being empty in AWS CloudWatch using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. List the current WAF global rules in your AWS account to identify if there are any empty rules:
```bash
aws wafv2 list-rules --scope REGIONAL --query 'Rules[?DefaultAction.RuleActionName==`ALLOW` && count(Statements)==`0`]'
```

2. Identify the ARN of the empty WAF global rule that needs to be updated.

3. Update the empty WAF global rule with a valid rule statement. You can create a new rule statement using the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console. Here is an example of creating a new rule statement using AWS CLI:
```bash
aws wafv2 update-rule --name "YOUR_RULE_NAME" --scope REGIONAL --id YOUR_RULE_ID --description "YOUR_RULE_DESCRIPTION" --action "ALLOW" --statements "Statement={YOUR_STATEMENT_HERE}"
```

4. Validate the changes by listing the rules again to ensure the WAF global rule is no longer empty:
```bash
aws wafv2 list-rules --scope REGIONAL --query 'Rules[?RuleId==`YOUR_RULE_ID`]'
```

5. Monitor the WAF global rules regularly to ensure they are not empty and are effectively protecting your resources.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF global rules in AWS CloudWatch using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rules in AWS CloudWatch using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary Python libraries:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

2. Use the following Python script to check if there are any empty WAF Global Rules and update them if found:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize the AWS WAF client
waf_client = boto3.client('waf')

# Get a list of all WAF Global Rules
response = waf_client.list_rules()

# Check if there are any empty WAF Global Rules
empty_rules = [rule['RuleId'] for rule in response['Rules'] if not rule['Predicates']]

# If there are empty WAF Global Rules, update them
if empty_rules:
    for rule_id in empty_rules:
        # Get the details of the empty rule
        rule_details = waf_client.get_rule(RuleId=rule_id)
        
        # Add a sample predicate to the rule (you can customize this as needed)
        updated_rule = {
            'RuleId': rule_id,
            'ChangeToken': waf_client.get_change_token()['ChangeToken'],
            'Updates': [
                {
                    'Action': 'INSERT',
                    'Predicate': {
                        'Negated': False,
                        'Type': 'IPMatch',
                        'DataId': 'SampleIPSetId'  # Replace this with a valid IPSetId
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
        
        # Update the rule with the sample predicate
        waf_client.update_rule(**updated_rule)
        
        print(f'Updated WAF Global Rule {rule_id} with a sample predicate')

else:
    print('No empty WAF Global Rules found')
```

3. Replace `'SampleIPSetId'` with a valid IPSetId and customize the predicate as needed.

4. Run the Python script to check for and update any empty WAF Global Rules in AWS CloudWatch.

This script will help you identify any empty WAF Global Rules and update them with a sample predicate. Make sure to customize the predicate data according to your specific requirements.
