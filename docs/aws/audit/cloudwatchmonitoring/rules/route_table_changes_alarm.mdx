1. Log in to your AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudWatch service.

2. In the CloudWatch dashboard, click on "Alarms" in the left-hand navigation pane.

3. In the Alarms dashboard, you can see a list of all the alarms that have been configured. Look for the Route Table Changes Alarm in the list. If it's not there, it means it hasn't been set up.

4. Click on the Route Table Changes Alarm to view its details. Here you can check its status, conditions, actions, and the history of its state changes. If the alarm is in the "ALARM" state, it means that the route table changes have exceeded the threshold set in the alarm's conditions.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the `describe-alarms` command to list all the alarms in your AWS account. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the alarms, including the Route Table Changes Alarm if it exists.

3. To filter out the Route Table Changes Alarm, you can use the `--alarm-names` option followed by the name of the alarm. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names "Route Table Changes Alarm"
   ```
   This command will return the details of the Route Table Changes Alarm if it exists.

4. To check the state of the Route Table Changes Alarm, you can use the `--state-value` option followed by the state you want to check. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --state-value "ALARM"
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the alarms that are currently in the ALARM state, including the Route Table Changes Alarm if it is in the ALARM state.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To detect Route Table Changes Alarm in Cloud Watch using python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:**
   Before you can begin using Boto3, you should set up authentication credentials. You can do this by using the AWS CLI or by directly setting your AWS credentials in the following way:
   ```
   aws configure
   AWS Access Key ID [None]: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   Default region name [None]: YOUR_REGION_NAME
   Default output format [None]: json
   ```

3. **Create a Python Script to Fetch CloudWatch Alarms:**
   You can use the `describe_alarms` method of the CloudWatch client in Boto3 to fetch all the alarms. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def get_cloudwatch_alarms():
       client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
       response = client.describe_alarms()
       return response['MetricAlarms']

   alarms = get_cloudwatch_alarms()
   for alarm in alarms:
       print(alarm['AlarmName'])
   ```
   This script will print the names of all the alarms in CloudWatch.

4. **Filter Alarms for Route Table Changes:**
   You can modify the above script to filter out the alarms related to Route Table changes. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def get_route_table_change_alarms():
       client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
       response = client.describe_alarms()
       alarms = response['MetricAlarms']
       route_table_change_alarms = [alarm for alarm in alarms if 'RouteTable' in alarm['AlarmName']]
       return route_table_change_alarms

   alarms = get_route_table_change_alarms()
   for alarm in alarms:
       print(alarm['AlarmName'])
   ```
   This script will print the names of all the alarms related to Route Table changes.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
#### Remediation using AWS Console:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to CloudWatch dashboard at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

3. In the left navigation panel, select **Logs**.

4. Select the log group created for your CloudTrail trail event logs and click **Create Metric Filter**.

5. On the Define Logs Metric Filter page, paste the following pattern inside the Filter Pattern box:

```plaintext
{
    ($.eventName = CreateRoute) || ($.eventName = CreateRouteTable) || ($.eventName = ReplaceRoute) ||
    ($.eventName = ReplaceRouteTableAssociation) || ($.eventName = DeleteRouteTable) || ($.eventName = DeleteRoute) ||
    ($.eventName = DisassociateRouteTable)
}
```

This pattern will be used for scanning the AWS CloudTrail logs for event names like `“CreateRoute”`, `“CreateRouteTable”`, `“ReplaceRoute”`, `“ReplaceRouteTableAssociation”`, `“DeleteRouteTable”`, `“DeleteRoute”`, or `“DisassociateRouteTable”`.

6. Review the metric filter config details, then click Assign Metric.

7. On the Create Metric Filter and Assign a Metric page, perform the following:

   - In the Filter Name box, enter a unique name for the new filter, e.g. RouteTableConfigChanges.
   - In the Metric Namespace box, type CloudTrailMetrics.
   - In the Metric Name box, type RouteTableEventCount for the metric identifier.
   - Click Show advanced metric settings to expand the advanced settings section.
   - In the Metric Value box, enter 1.

8. Review the details, then click Create Filter to generate your new CloudWatch Logs metric filter.

9. On the current page, click Create Alarm:

   - In the Alarm Threshold section, in the Name and Description fields, enter a unique name and a short description for the new CloudWatch alarm.
   - Under Whenever: Metric Name, select >= (greater than or equal to) from the is dropdown list and enter 1 as the threshold value to trigger the alarm every time a configuration change involving an AWS Route Table is made.
   - In the Actions section, click the + Notification button, select State is ALARM from the Whenever this alarm dropdown menu, and choose the AWS SNS topic created at Step 1.
   - In the Alarm Preview section, select 5 Minutes from the Period dropdown list and Sum from the Statistic list.

10. Review the CloudWatch alarm configuration details, then click Create Alarm.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Route Table Changes" alarm using the AWS Console.

#### Remediation using AWS CLI:

1. Run the put-metric-filter command to create the necessary CloudWatch metric filter and associate it with the appropriate Amazon CloudTrail log group:

```bash
aws logs put-metric-filter \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --log-group-name CloudTrail/CloudWatchLogGroup \
    --filter-name RouteTableConfigChanges \
    --filter-pattern '{ ($.eventName = CreateRoute) || ($.eventName = CreateRouteTable) || ($.eventName = ReplaceRoute) || ($.eventName = ReplaceRouteTableAssociation) || ($.eventName = DeleteRouteTable) || ($.eventName = DeleteRoute) || ($.eventName = DisassociateRouteTable) }' \
    --metric-transformations metricName=RouteTableEventCount,metricNamespace=CloudTrailMetrics,metricValue=1
```

2. Run the put-metric-alarm command to create the AWS CloudWatch alarm:

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --alarm-name RouteTableConfigChangesAlarm \
    --alarm-description "Triggered by AWS Route Table config changes." \
    --metric-name RouteTableEventCount \
    --namespace CloudTrailMetrics \
    --statistic Sum \
    --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold \
    --evaluation-periods 1 \
    --period 300 \
    --threshold 1 \
    --actions-enabled \
    --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:CloudWatchAlarmSNSTopic
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Route Table Changes" alarm using the AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
#### Remediation using Python:

1. First, check the CloudWatch alarm to identify the route table that has been modified.

2. Once identified, use the boto3 library to fetch the events from CloudTrail related to route table changes:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')

response = client.lookup_events(
    LookupAttributes=[
        {
            'AttributeKey': 'ResourceName',
            'AttributeValue': '<route_table_id>'
        },
        {
            'AttributeKey': 'EventName',
            'AttributeValue': 'ModifyRouteTable'
        }
    ]
)

events = response['Events']
```

Replace `<route_table_id>` with the ID of the modified route table.

3. Extract the previous state of the route table from the CloudTrail event. The previous state is stored in the previousState field of the resourceProperties object.

4. Use the boto3 library to revert the route table to its previous state:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('ec2')

response = client.replace_route_table_association(
    AssociationId='<association_id>',
    RouteTableId='<route_table_id>'
)

print(response)
```

Replace association_id with the ID of the route table association, and route_table_id with the ID of the modified route table.

5. Confirm that the route table has been updated to its previous state by checking the AWS Management Console or using the boto3 library to fetch the route table details.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Route Table Changes" alarm using Python.
