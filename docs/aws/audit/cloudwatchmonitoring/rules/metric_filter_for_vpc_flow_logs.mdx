How to create the necessary metric filter and attach it to the VPC Flow Logs CloudWatch log group available in AWS account?

### Using AWS Console

To create a metric filter and attach it to the VPC Flow Logs CloudWatch log group in your AWS account, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the CloudWatch console: Go to the AWS Management Console, navigate to the CloudWatch service, and open the CloudWatch console.

2. Navigate to Log Groups: In the CloudWatch console, select "Log groups" from the left-hand menu.

3. Select the VPC Flow Logs log group: Locate and select the log group that contains your VPC Flow Logs.

4. Click "Create Metric Filter": Click on the "Create Metric Filter" button to create a new metric filter.

5. Define filter pattern: In the "Define filter pattern" section, specify a filter pattern that matches the log entries you want to extract metrics from. You can use a combination of keywords, wildcards, and regular expressions to define the pattern.

6. Configure filter details: In the "Filter details" section, specify the details for the metric filter. Provide a name for the filter, and configure the extraction of dimensions and values from the log events. You can use placeholders to extract specific fields or values from the log events.

7. Configure filter results: In the "Filter results" section, specify the metric namespace, metric name, and metric value that will be generated based on the filtered log events.

8. Review and create the metric filter: Review the configuration of the metric filter and click on the "Create filter" button to create the metric filter and attach it to the log group.

Once the metric filter is created and attached to the VPC Flow Logs log group, CloudWatch will start extracting metrics from the log events based on the filter pattern you defined. You can view and manage your metric filters in the CloudWatch console under the "Log groups" section.
