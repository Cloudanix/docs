How to enable internet gateway changes alarm in Cloudwatch?

### Using AWS Console

To enable an alarm for Internet Gateway changes in CloudWatch, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the CloudWatch console: Go to the AWS Management Console, navigate to the CloudWatch service, and open the CloudWatch console.

2. Navigate to Alarms: In the CloudWatch console, select "Alarms" from the left-hand menu.

3. Click "Create Alarm": Click on the "Create Alarm" button to create a new alarm.

4. Select metric: In the "Create Alarm" wizard, under the "Select metric" section, click on the "Select metric" button.

5. Choose the Internet Gateway metric: In the "Browse" tab, navigate to "AWS > VPC > Per Gateway Metrics" and select the desired Internet Gateway metric. For example, you can choose the "InternetGatewayAttachmentChange" metric.

6. Configure conditions: Set the conditions for the alarm. Specify the threshold that will trigger the alarm, such as the number of occurrences or the percentage of change. You can also set the evaluation period and the period over which the metric data is evaluated.

7. Set actions: Configure the actions that will be triggered when the alarm state changes. You can choose to send notifications, perform an Auto Scaling action, or execute an AWS Systems Manager Automation document, among other options.

8. Provide alarm details: Provide a name and description for the alarm, and optionally assign tags for easier organization and management.

9. Review and create the alarm: Review the alarm configuration and click on the "Create alarm" button to create the alarm.

Once the alarm is created, it will start monitoring the Internet Gateway metric specified. If the metric breaches the threshold you set, the alarm state will change, and any configured actions will be triggered. You can view and manage your alarms in the CloudWatch console under the "Alarms" section.
