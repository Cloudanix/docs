<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can install AWS CLI by using pip (Python package manager). Use the following command to install AWS CLI:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   After installing AWS CLI, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. Use the following command to configure AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format. Enter the appropriate values for these fields.

2. List all CloudWatch alarms: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the CloudWatch alarms in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the CloudWatch alarms in your AWS account. Look for the alarm that is set for Internet Gateway changes.

3. Check the state of the alarm: Use the following AWS CLI command to check the state of the alarm:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarm-history --alarm-name "your_alarm_name"
   ```
   Replace "your_alarm_name" with the name of the alarm that is set for Internet Gateway changes. This command will return the history of the alarm, including the state changes.

4. Check the alarm actions: Use the following AWS CLI command to check the actions of the alarm:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names "your_alarm_name"

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Set up AWS SDK and Python Boto3**: First, you need to set up your AWS SDK and Python Boto3. Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials**: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can configure your credentials via the AWS CLI, or by manually creating the file yourself. The default location for the file is `~/.aws/credentials`. At a minimum, the credentials file should specify the access key and secret access key. To specify these for the `default` profile, you can use the following format:

```python
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

3. **Create a Python Script to Check Internet Gateway Changes**: You can use the `describe_internet_gateways` method provided by the Boto3 SDK to retrieve information about the internet gateways. Here is a simple script that lists all the internet gateways:

```python
import boto3

def list_internet_gateways():
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
    for igw in ec2.internet_gateways.all():
        print(igw.id)

list_internet_gateways()
```

4. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm for Internet Gateway Changes**: You can use the `put_metric_alarm` method provided by the Boto3 SDK to create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers when changes are made to the internet gateways. Here is a simple script that creates such an alarm:

```python
import boto3

def create_alarm():
    cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
    response = cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
        AlarmName='InternetGatewayChanges',
        ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanThreshold',
        MetricName='InternetGatewayChanges',
        Namespace='AWS/EC2',
        Statistic='SampleCount',
        Period=300,
        EvaluationPeriods=1,
        Threshold=1,
        ActionsEnabled=True,
        AlarmActions=[
            'arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic'
        ],
        AlarmDescription='Alarm when internet gateway changes exceed 1',
        Dimensions=[
            {
                'Name': 'InternetGatewayId',
                'Value': 'igw-0123456789abcdef0'
            },
        ],
        Unit='Count'
    )

create_alarm()
```

Please note that you need to replace `'arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic'` with the ARN of your SNS topic, and `'igw-0123456789abcdef0'` with the ID of your internet gateway. This script will create an alarm that sends a notification to the specified SNS topic when the number of changes to the specified internet gateway exceeds 1 within a 5-minute period.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the "Internet Gateway Changes Alarm" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the CloudWatch service.
3. In the left-hand menu, click on "Alarms".
4. Locate the "Internet Gateway Changes Alarm" from the list of alarms and select it.
5. Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Disable Alarm".
6. Confirm that you want to disable the alarm by clicking "Yes, Disable".
7. If you want to permanently remove the alarm, select the alarm again and click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Delete Alarm".
8. Confirm that you want to delete the alarm by clicking "Yes, Delete".

Once you have completed these steps, the "Internet Gateway Changes Alarm" will be remediated in AWS. It is important to note that disabling or deleting an alarm will prevent you from receiving notifications if the alarm is triggered in the future. Therefore, it is recommended to review the alarm settings and adjust them accordingly to avoid future misconfigurations.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The "Internet Gateway Changes Alarm" indicates that changes have been made to the internet gateway in your AWS environment. To remediate this issue using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to describe the internet gateways in your AWS environment:

```
aws ec2 describe-internet-gateways
```

3. Identify the internet gateway that has been changed by comparing the output of the above command with the previous state of your environment.

4. Run the following command to delete the internet gateway:

```
aws ec2 delete-internet-gateway --internet-gateway-id `<internet_gateway_id>`
```

Note: Replace `<internet_gateway_id>` with the ID of the internet gateway that has been changed.

5. If the internet gateway was deleted by mistake, run the following command to create a new internet gateway:

```
aws ec2 create-internet-gateway
```

6. Attach the new internet gateway to your VPC using the following command:

```
aws ec2 attach-internet-gateway --internet-gateway-id <new_internet_gateway_id> --vpc-id <vpc_id>
```

Note: Replace `<new_internet_gateway_id>` with the ID of the new internet gateway that was created and `<vpc_id>` with the ID of your VPC.

7. Verify that the internet gateway has been remediated by running the describe-internet-gateways command again and checking that the internet gateway is attached to your VPC.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
The misconfiguration "Internet Gateway Changes Alarm" in AWS can occur when there is a change in the Internet Gateway associated with the VPC. To remediate this, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. Import the necessary modules and define the AWS client:

```
import boto3
client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
```

2. Define the name of the alarm that needs to be remediated:

```
alarm_name = 'InternetGatewayChangesAlarm'
```

3. Get the alarm details using the `describe_alarms()` method:

```
response = client.describe_alarms(
    AlarmNames=[alarm_name]
)
```

4. Check if the alarm exists and has the correct action:

```
if len(response['MetricAlarms']) == 0:
    print(f"The alarm {alarm_name} does not exist.")
elif response['MetricAlarms'][0]['AlarmActions'] == []:
    print(f"The alarm {alarm_name} has no actions.")
else:
    print(f"The alarm {alarm_name} has actions.")
```

5. If the alarm exists and has no actions, add the necessary action using the `put_metric_alarm()` method:

```
response = client.put_metric_alarm(
    AlarmName=alarm_name,
    AlarmActions=['arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyTopic'],
    MetricName='InternetGatewayAttached',
    Namespace='AWS/EC2',
    Statistic='Sum',
    Dimensions=[
        {
            'Name': 'VpcId',
            'Value': 'vpc-12345678'
        },
    ],
    Period=300,
    EvaluationPeriods=1,
    Threshold=1,
    ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold',
    TreatMissingData='notBreaching'
)
```

Note: Replace the `AlarmActions` value with the ARN of the SNS topic that needs to be notified.

6. Verify that the action has been added:

```
response = client.describe_alarms(
    AlarmNames=[alarm_name]
)

if response['MetricAlarms'][0]['AlarmActions'] == []:
    print(f"The alarm {alarm_name} still has no actions.")
else:
    print(f"The alarm {alarm_name} now has actions.")
```

7. If the action was successfully added, print a success message:

```
print(f"The alarm {alarm_name} has been remediated.")
```

This Python script will add an SNS topic as the action for the "Internet Gateway Changes Alarm" in AWS.
