2. In the navigation pane, click on "Alarms".

3. In the "Alarms" dashboard, you can see all the alarms that have been set up. Look for the Internet Gateway Changes Alarm. If it's in the "ALARM" state, it means that the changes in the Internet Gateway have crossed the threshold that was set when the alarm was created.

4. For more details about the alarm, click on the alarm name. This will open a new page where you can see the alarm's details, history, and the actions associated with it. The "History" tab will show all the state changes of the alarm and the reason for each state change.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can install AWS CLI by using pip (Python package manager). Use the following command to install AWS CLI:

   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   After installing AWS CLI, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. Use the following command to configure AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format. Enter the appropriate values for these fields.

2. List all CloudWatch alarms: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the CloudWatch alarms in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the CloudWatch alarms in your AWS account. Look for the alarm that is set for Internet Gateway changes.

3. Check the state of the alarm: Use the following AWS CLI command to check the state of the alarm:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarm-history --alarm-name "your_alarm_name"
   ```
   Replace "your_alarm_name" with the name of the alarm that is set for Internet Gateway changes. This command will return the history of the alarm, including the state changes.

4. Check the alarm actions: Use the following AWS CLI command to check the actions of the alarm:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names "your_alarm_name"
   ```
   Replace "your_alarm_name" with the name of the alarm that is set for Internet Gateway changes. This command will return the details of the alarm, including the actions that are set for the alarm.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Set up AWS SDK and Python Boto3**: First, you need to set up your AWS SDK and Python Boto3. Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials**: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can configure your credentials via the AWS CLI, or by manually creating the file yourself. The default location for the file is `~/.aws/credentials`. At a minimum, the credentials file should specify the access key and secret access key. To specify these for the `default` profile, you can use the following format:

```python
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

3. **Create a Python Script to Check Internet Gateway Changes**: You can use the `describe_internet_gateways` method provided by the Boto3 SDK to retrieve information about the internet gateways. Here is a simple script that lists all the internet gateways:

```python
import boto3

def list_internet_gateways():
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
    for igw in ec2.internet_gateways.all():
        print(igw.id)

list_internet_gateways()
```

4. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm for Internet Gateway Changes**: You can use the `put_metric_alarm` method provided by the Boto3 SDK to create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers when changes are made to the internet gateways. Here is a simple script that creates such an alarm:

```python
import boto3

def create_alarm():
    cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
    response = cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
        AlarmName='InternetGatewayChanges',
        ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanThreshold',
        MetricName='InternetGatewayChanges',
        Namespace='AWS/EC2',
        Statistic='SampleCount',
        Period=300,
        EvaluationPeriods=1,
        Threshold=1,
        ActionsEnabled=True,
        AlarmActions=[
            'arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic'
        ],
        AlarmDescription='Alarm when internet gateway changes exceed 1',
        Dimensions=[
            {
                'Name': 'InternetGatewayId',
                'Value': 'igw-0123456789abcdef0'
            },
        ],
        Unit='Count'
    )

create_alarm()
```

Please note that you need to replace `'arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic'` with the ARN of your SNS topic, and `'igw-0123456789abcdef0'` with the ID of your internet gateway. This script will create an alarm that sends a notification to the specified SNS topic when the number of changes to the specified internet gateway exceeds 1 within a 5-minute period.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the "Internet Gateway Changes Alarm" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the CloudWatch dashboard at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).
3. In the left navigation panel, select **Logs**.
4. Select the log group created for your CloudTrail trail event logs and click **Create Metric Filter**.
5. On the **Define Logs Metric Filter** page, paste the following pattern inside the **Filter Pattern** box:

```
{
    ($.eventName = CreateCustomerGateway) || ($.eventName = DeleteCustomerGateway) || ($.eventName = AttachInternetGateway) ||
    ($.eventName = CreateInternetGateway) || ($.eventName = DeleteInternetGateway) || ($.eventName = DetachInternetGateway)
}
```

This pattern will be used for scanning the AWS CloudTrail logs for event names like `“CreateInternetGateway”`, `“AttachInternetGateway”` or `“DeleteInternetGateway”`.

6. Review the metric filter configuration details, then click **Assign Metric**.
7. On the **Create Metric Filter and Assign a Metric** page, perform the following:
   - In the **Filter Name** box, enter a unique name for the new filter, e.g., `VPCGatewayConfigChanges`.
   - In the **Metric Namespace** box, type `CloudTrailMetrics`.
   - In the **Metric Name** box, type `GatewayEventCount` for the metric identifier.
   - Click **Show advanced metric settings** to slide down the advanced settings section.
   - In the **Metric Value** box, enter `1`.
8. Review the details, then click **Create Filter** to generate your new CloudWatch Logs metric filter.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
The misconfiguration "Internet Gateway Changes Alarm" in AWS can occur when there is a change in the Internet Gateway associated with the VPC. To remediate this, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. Import the necessary modules and define the AWS client:

```python
import boto3
client = boto3.client('logs')
cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
```

2. Define the log group name, metric filter name, and alarm name:

```
log_group_name = 'CloudTrail/CloudWatchLogGroup'
filter_name = 'VPCGatewayConfigChanges'
alarm_name = 'VPCGatewayConfigChangesAlarm'
```

3. Create the metric filter using the `put_metric_filter` method:

```python
response = client.put_metric_filter(
    logGroupName=log_group_name,
    filterName=filter_name,
    filterPattern='{ ($.eventName = CreateCustomerGateway) || ($.eventName = DeleteCustomerGateway) || ($.eventName = AttachInternetGateway) || ($.eventName = CreateInternetGateway) || ($.eventName = DeleteInternetGateway) || ($.eventName = DetachInternetGateway) }',
    metricTransformations=[
        {
            'metricName': 'GatewayEventCount',
            'metricNamespace': 'CloudTrailMetrics',
            'metricValue': '1'
        }
    ]
)
```

4. Create the CloudWatch alarm using the put_metric_alarm method:

```
cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
    AlarmName=alarm_name,
    AlarmDescription="Triggered by VPC Customer/Internet Gateway changes.",
    MetricName='GatewayEventCount',
    Namespace='CloudTrailMetrics',
    Statistic='Sum',
    Period=300,
    EvaluationPeriods=1,
    Threshold=1,
    ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold',
    ActionsEnabled=True,
    AlarmActions=['arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:CloudWatchAlarmSNSTopic']
)
```

5. Verify the alarm has been created:

```
response = cloudwatch.describe_alarms(
    AlarmNames=[alarm_name]
)

if len(response['MetricAlarms']) > 0:
    print(f"The alarm '{alarm_name}' has been created successfully.")
else:
    print(f"Failed to create the alarm '{alarm_name}'.")
```
