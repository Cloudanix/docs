### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS WAF & Shield service.

2. In the navigation pane, select "WebACLs". This will display a list of all your Web Access Control Lists (WebACLs).

3. Select the WebACL that you want to check. This will open the details page for that WebACL.

4. In the details page, check the "Rules" section. If the section is empty or does not contain any global rules, then the WAF Global Rules are empty.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all the WebACLs: Use the following command to list all the WebACLs in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws wafv2 list-web-acls --scope REGIONAL
   ```
   This command will return a list of WebACLs along with their Ids and ARNs.

3. Get the details of each WebACL: For each WebACL, use the following command to get its details:

   ```
   aws wafv2 get-web-acl --scope REGIONAL --id <WebACLId> --name <WebACLName> --region <Region>
   ```
   Replace `<WebACLId>`, `<WebACLName>`, and `<Region>` with the actual Id, Name, and Region of the WebACL. This command will return the details of the WebACL including its rules.

4. Check if the Global Rules are empty: In the output of the previous command, look for the "Rules" field. If this field is empty or does not exist, then the Global Rules are empty. If the "Rules" field contains one or more rules, then the Global Rules are not empty.

#### Using Python

To check if WAF Global Rules are not empty in AWS CloudWatch using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Setup AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. **Import Boto3 and Initialize WAF Client:**
   Import the Boto3 library in your Python script and initialize the WAF client.
   ```python
   import boto3
   waf = boto3.client('waf')
   ```

3. **List WebACLs:**
   Use the `list_web_acls()` function to get a list of all WebACLs.
   ```python
   response = waf.list_web_acls(Limit=100)
   web_acls = response['WebACLs']
   ```

4. **Check Global Rules:**
   For each WebACL, get the rules and check if they are empty. If the rules are empty, print a message.
   ```python
   for web_acl in web_acls:
       web_acl_id = web_acl['WebACLId']
       response = waf.get_web_acl(WebACLId=web_acl_id)
       rules = response['WebACL']['Rules']
       if not rules:
           print(f'WebACL {web_acl_id} has no global rules.')
   ```
   This script will print a message for each WebACL that has no global rules. If no messages are printed, then all WebACLs have at least one global rule.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of WAF Global Rules being empty in AWS CloudWatch, you can follow these step-by-step instructions using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to your AWS account using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to AWS WAF**: In the AWS Management Console, search for "WAF" in the services search bar and click on "AWS WAF" to open the AWS WAF console.

3. **Select the Web ACL**: In the AWS WAF console, click on "Web ACLs" in the left-hand navigation pane. Select the Web ACL that you want to configure the global rules for.

4. **Add Global Rules**: Within the selected Web ACL, click on the "Rules" tab. Here you will see the list of rules configured for the Web ACL.

5. **Add a New Rule**: Click on the "Add rules" button to add a new rule to the Web ACL.

6. **Configure Global Rule**: In the rule configuration window, select the rule type as "Global Rule" from the drop-down menu.

7. **Define Rule Criteria**: Define the criteria for the global rule based on your security requirements. This could include conditions like IP addresses, URI paths, query strings, etc.

8. **Set Rule Action**: Choose the appropriate action to be taken when the global rule conditions are met. This could be to allow, block, or count the request.

9. **Review and Save**: Review the configured global rule settings to ensure they align with your security policies. Once confirmed, click on the "Save" button to add the global rule to the Web ACL.

10. **Verify Configuration**: After adding the global rule, ensure that it is listed under the rules section of the Web ACL and that it is properly configured.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rules in AWS CloudWatch and enhance the security of your web applications.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rules in AWS Cloud Watch using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. List the current WAF Global Rules in AWS Cloud Watch using the following AWS CLI command:
```
aws wafv2 list-web-acls --scope REGIONAL
```

2. Identify the Web ACL that has empty global rules.

3. Update the Web ACL by adding appropriate global rules. You can create a new global rule or update existing ones using the AWS CLI command. For example, to create a new global rule, you can use the following command:

```
aws wafv2 create-rule-group --name "MyGlobalRule" --scope REGIONAL --capacity 100 --rules file://global_rules.json
```

Make sure to replace "MyGlobalRule" with the desired name for the rule group and provide the rule definitions in the JSON file "global_rules.json".

4. Associate the newly created global rule with the Web ACL using the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws wafv2 associate-web-acl --web-acl-arn <web_acl_arn> --web-acl-name <web_acl_name> --scope REGIONAL
```

Replace `<web_acl_arn>` and `<web_acl_name>` with the ARN and name of the Web ACL that needs to be updated.

5. Verify that the global rules are no longer empty by listing the Web ACLs again using the command in step 1.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rules in AWS Cloud Watch using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rules in AWS CloudWatch using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Boto3 library by running the following command in your Python environment:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

2. Use the following Python script to check if there are any empty WAF Global Rules in AWS CloudWatch and update them if necessary:

```python
import boto3

def remediate_empty_waf_global_rules():
    # Initialize the AWS CloudWatch client
    cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

    # Get the list of all WAF Global Rules
    response = cloudwatch.describe_waf_global_rules()

    for rule in response['WAFGlobalRules']:
        rule_id = rule['RuleId']
        rule_name = rule['Name']

        # Check if the rule is empty
        if not rule['Predicates']:
            print(f"Empty WAF Global Rule found: {rule_name} (ID: {rule_id})")

            # Remediate by adding a default condition (e.g., IPSet)
            response = cloudwatch.update_waf_global_rule(
                RuleId=rule_id,
                Updates=[
                    {
                        'Action': 'INSERT',
                        'Predicate': {
                            'DataId': 'IPSetId',
                            'Negated': False,
                            'Type': 'IPMatch'
                        }
                    }
                ]
            )

            print(f"Remediated empty WAF Global Rule: {rule_name} (ID: {rule_id})")

    print("Remediation completed.")

# Call the function to remediate empty WAF Global Rules
remediate_empty_waf_global_rules()
```

3. Run the Python script in your environment. This script will identify any empty WAF Global Rules in AWS CloudWatch and remediate them by adding a default condition (e.g., IPSet).

By following these steps, you can effectively remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rules in AWS CloudWatch using Python.
