<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent WAF Global Rule Groups from being empty in AWS using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a WAF Rule Group:**
   First, create a WAF Rule Group if you don't already have one. This will serve as a container for your rules.

   ```sh
   aws wafv2 create-rule-group \
       --name "MyRuleGroup" \
       --scope "CLOUDFRONT" \
       --capacity 100 \
       --region us-east-1 \
       --rules '[]' \
       --visibility-config SampledRequestsEnabled=true,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=true,MetricName="MyRuleGroupMetric"
   ```

2. **Create a WAF Rule:**
   Create a WAF rule that you will add to your rule group. This example creates a simple rate-based rule.

   ```sh
   aws wafv2 create-rule \
       --name "RateLimitRule" \
       --scope "CLOUDFRONT" \
       --region us-east-1 \
       --statement '{"RateBasedStatement":{"Limit":2000,"AggregateKeyType":"IP"}}' \
       --visibility-config SampledRequestsEnabled=true,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=true,MetricName="RateLimitRuleMetric"
   ```

3. **Update the Rule Group to Include the Rule:**
   Add the created rule to your rule group to ensure it is not empty.

   ```sh
   aws wafv2 update-rule-group \
       --name "MyRuleGroup" \
       --scope "CLOUDFRONT" \
       --region us-east-1 \
       --rules '[{"Name":"RateLimitRule","Priority":1,"Statement":{"RateBasedStatement":{"Limit":2000,"AggregateKeyType":"IP"}},"Action":{"Block":{}},"VisibilityConfig":{"SampledRequestsEnabled":true,"CloudWatchMetricsEnabled":true,"MetricName":"RateLimitRuleMetric"}}]' \
       --visibility-config SampledRequestsEnabled=true,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=true,MetricName="MyRuleGroupMetric"
   ```

4. **Associate the Rule Group with a Web ACL:**
   Finally, associate the rule group with a Web ACL to apply the rules.

   ```sh
   aws wafv2 associate-web-acl \
       --web-acl-arn "arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/MyWebACL" \
       --resource-arn "arn:aws:cloudfront::123456789012:distribution/EDFDVBD6EXAMPLE"
   ```

By following these steps, you ensure that your WAF Global Rule Groups are not empty, thus preventing the misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent WAF Global Rule Groups from being empty in AWS using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here are the steps to ensure that your WAF Global Rule Groups are not empty:

1. **Install Boto3 Library**:
   Ensure you have the Boto3 library installed. If not, you can install it using pip.
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**:
   Initialize the Boto3 client for WAF.
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('waf')
   ```

3. **List Rule Groups**:
   Fetch the list of all WAF Global Rule Groups.
   ```python
   response = client.list_rule_groups()
   rule_groups = response['RuleGroups']
   ```

4. **Check and Add Rules to Empty Rule Groups**:
   Iterate through each rule group and check if it is empty. If it is, add a default rule to it.
   ```python
   for rule_group in rule_groups:
       rule_group_id = rule_group['RuleGroupId']
       
       # Get the details of the rule group
       rule_group_details = client.get_rule_group(RuleGroupId=rule_group_id)
       rules = rule_group_details['RuleGroup']['Rules']
       
       # Check if the rule group is empty
       if not rules:
           # Add a default rule to the rule group
           default_rule = {
               'Action': {'Type': 'BLOCK'},
               'Priority': 1,
               'RuleId': 'example-rule-id',  # Replace with a valid RuleId
               'Type': 'REGULAR'
           }
           
           # Update the rule group with the default rule
           client.update_rule_group(
               RuleGroupId=rule_group_id,
               Updates=[
                   {
                       'Action': 'INSERT',
                       'ActivatedRule': default_rule
                   }
               ],
               ChangeToken=client.get_change_token()['ChangeToken']
           )
           print(f"Added default rule to rule group {rule_group_id}")
```

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Install Boto3 Library**: Ensure Boto3 is installed.
2. **Initialize Boto3 Client**: Set up the WAF client.
3. **List Rule Groups**: Retrieve all WAF Global Rule Groups.
4. **Check and Add Rules to Empty Rule Groups**: Verify if rule groups are empty and add a default rule if necessary.

This script ensures that no WAF Global Rule Group remains empty by adding a default rule if it finds any empty rule groups. Make sure to replace `'example-rule-id'` with a valid RuleId that you have created or intend to use.

<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS WAF & Shield console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "WebACLs". This will show you a list of all your WebACLs.

3. Select the WebACL that you want to check. This will open the details page for that WebACL.

4. In the "Rules" section, check if there are any global rule groups that are empty. If a rule group is empty, it means that it doesn't contain any rules. This is a misconfiguration because an empty rule group doesn't provide any protection.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. List all the WebACLs: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the WebACLs in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws wafv2 list-web-acls --scope REGIONAL
   ```
   This command will return a list of WebACLs along with their Ids and ARNs.

3. Get the details of each WebACL: For each WebACL, use the following AWS CLI command to get its details:

   ```
   aws wafv2 get-web-acl --scope REGIONAL --id `<WebACLId>` --name `<WebACLName>` --region `<Region>`
   ```
   Replace `<WebACLId>`, `<WebACLName>`, and `<Region>` with the actual Id, Name, and Region of the WebACL. This command will return the details of the WebACL including its rules.

4. Check if the Global Rule Group is empty: In the output of the previous command, look for the `Rules` field. If the `Rules` field is empty or does not contain a `RuleGroupReferenceStatement`, then the Global Rule Group is empty.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if WAF Global Rule Groups are not empty in AWS CloudWatch using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Set up your environment:**
   Before you start, make sure you have Python and Boto3 installed in your environment. You also need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by using the AWS CLI and running `aws configure`.

2. **Import necessary libraries and create a WAF client:**
   In your Python script, you need to import Boto3 and create a WAF client. Here's how you can do it:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create WAF client
   waf = boto3.client('waf')
   ```

3. **List all the WebACLs:**
   You can use the `list_web_acls()` function to get all the WebACLs. Here's how you can do it:

   ```python
   # List all WebACLs
   web_acls = waf.list_web_acls(Limit=100)
   ```

4. **Check if Rule Groups are not empty:**
   For each WebACL, you can get the details using `get_web_acl()` function and check if the Rule Groups are not empty. Here's how you can do it:

   ```python
   # Check if Rule Groups are not empty
   for web_acl in web_acls['WebACLs']:
       web_acl_id = web_acl['WebACLId']
       web_acl_details = waf.get_web_acl(WebACLId=web_acl_id)
       rules = web_acl_details['WebACL']['Rules']
       if not rules:
           print(f"WebACL {web_acl_id} has no rules.")
   ```

This script will print the IDs of all WebACLs that have no rules. If the script doesn't print anything, it means all your WAF Global Rule Groups are not empty.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rule Groups in AWS CloudWatch using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **List WAF Global Rule Groups**: First, list all the WAF Global Rule Groups to identify the empty ones. Run the following AWS CLI command:
   ```
   aws wafv2 list-available-managed-rule-groups --scope CLOUDWATCH_METRICS
   ```

2. **Identify Empty Rule Groups**: Look for any rule groups with an empty list of rules. Note down the ARN of the empty rule group that you want to remediate.

3. **Update Rule Group**: To remediate the empty rule group, you need to update the rule group with at least one rule. You can add a managed rule or a custom rule to the rule group. Run the following AWS CLI command to update the rule group:
   ```
   aws wafv2 update-managed-rule-set-version --name <rule-group-name> --id <rule-group-id> --lock-token <lock-token> --recommended-version <version> --rules-action <action> --scope CLOUDWATCH_METRICS
   ```

   - Replace `<rule-group-name>` with the name of the rule group.
   - Replace `<rule-group-id>` with the ID of the rule group.
   - Replace `<lock-token>` with the lock token of the rule group.
   - Replace `<version>` with the version of the rule set.
   - Replace `<action>` with the action to take on the rules (e.g., ALLOW, BLOCK).

4. **Verify Update**: After updating the rule group, verify that the rule group is no longer empty by listing the rules in the rule group:
   ```
   aws wafv2 list-managed-rules --scope CLOUDWATCH_METRICS --id <rule-group-id>
   ```

5. **Monitor Changes**: Monitor the CloudWatch metrics to ensure that the WAF Global Rule Groups are no longer empty and are actively protecting your resources.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rule Groups in AWS CloudWatch using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rule Groups in AWS CloudWatch using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:
```
pip install boto3
```

2. Write a Python script to check and remediate the empty WAF Global Rule Groups. Here is an example script:

```python
import boto3

def remediate_empty_waf_rule_groups():
    # Initialize the WAF client
    waf_client = boto3.client('waf')

    # Get a list of all WAF Global Rule Groups
    response = waf_client.list_rule_groups(Scope='CLOUDFRONT')

    for rule_group in response['RuleGroups']:
        rule_group_id = rule_group['RuleGroupId']
        
        # Check if the Rule Group is empty
        if not rule_group['Rules']:
            print(f"Rule Group {rule_group_id} is empty. Adding a rule to the Rule Group...")
            
            # Add a sample rule to the empty Rule Group
            waf_client.update_rule_group(
                RuleGroupId=rule_group_id,
                Updates=[
                    {
                        'Action': 'INSERT',
                        'ActivatedRule': {
                            'Priority': 1,
                            'RuleId': 'SampleRuleID'
                        }
                    }
                ]
            )
            
            print(f"Rule added to Rule Group {rule_group_id}")
        else:
            print(f"Rule Group {rule_group_id} is not empty")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    remediate_empty_waf_rule_groups()
```

3. Run the Python script on your local machine or any AWS compute instance with the necessary IAM permissions to interact with WAF.

This script will check all the WAF Global Rule Groups associated with CloudFront and add a sample rule to any empty Rule Groups found. Make sure to replace 'SampleRuleID' with the actual Rule ID you want to add to the empty Rule Groups.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rule Groups in AWS CloudWatch using Python.
