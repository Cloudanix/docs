How to create CloudWatch alarm and configured it in your AWS account to fire each time S3 bucket configuration change is made?

#### Using AWS Console

##### Create a Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic and the necessary subscription to send email notifications whenever the appropriate Amazon CloudWatch alarm is triggered.

- Step 1: In the navigation panel, select Topics and click the Create new topic button.

- Step 2: In the Create new topic dialog box, enter a name and a display name for your topic then click Create Topic.

- Step 3: Open the newly created SNS topic configuration page by clicking on its Amazon Resource Name (ARN):
- Step 4: Under Subscription section click Create Subscription.

- Step 5: Select Email as subscription protocol from the Protocol dropdown list.

- Step 6: In the Endpoint box, enter the email address where you want to receive the CloudWatch alarm notifications then click Create Subscription to create the required subscription.

- Step 7: Use your preferred email client application to open the message received from AWS Notifications, then click on the appropriate link to confirm your new subscription.

##### Create the necessary metric filter and the CloudWatch alarm that will fire and send email notifications whenever an AWS S3 Bucket configuration will change.

- Step 1: In the left navigation panel, select Logs.

- Step 2: Select the log group created for your CloudTrail trail event logs and click Create Metric Filter button.

- Step 3: On the Define Logs Metric Filter page, paste the following pattern inside the Filter Pattern box: `{ ($.eventSource = s3.amazonaws.com) && (($.eventName = PutBucketAcl) || ($.eventName = PutBucketPolicy) || ($.eventName = PutBucketCors) || ($.eventName = PutBucketLifecycle) || ($.eventName = PutBucketReplication) || ($.eventName = DeleteBucketPolicy) || ($.eventName = DeleteBucketCors) || ($.eventName = DeleteBucketLifecycle) || ($.eventName = DeleteBucketReplication)) }`. This pattern will be used for scanning the AWS CloudTrail logs for event names like "PutBucketAcl", "PutBucketPolicy", "PutBucketCors", "PutBucketLifecycle", "PutBucketReplication", "DeleteBucketPolicy", "DeleteBucketCors", "DeleteBucketLifecycle", or "DeleteBucketReplication".

- Step 4: Review the metric filter config details then click Assign Metric.

- Step 5: On the Create Metric Filter and Assign a Metric page, perform the following:
  A: In the Filter Name box, enter a unique name for the new filter, e.g. S3BucketConfigChanges.

  B: In the Metric Namespace box, type CloudTrailMetrics.

  C: In the Metric Name box, type S3BucketEventCount for the metric identifier.

  D: Click Show advanced metric settings to slide down the advanced settings section.

  E: In the Metric Value box, enter 1.

- Step 6: Review the details then click Create Filter to generate your new CloudWatch Logs metric filter.

- Step 7: On the current page click Create Alarm:
- Step 8: In the Create Alarm dialog box, provide the following information:
  A: Within the Alarm Threshold section, in the Name and Description fields, enter a unique name and a short description for the new CloudWatch alarm.

  B: Under Whenever: Metric Name, select >= (greater than or equal to) from the is dropdown list and enter 1 as the threshold value in the box next to the dropdown list to trigger the alarm every time a configuration change involving an AWS S3 Bucket within your account is made.

  C: In the Actions section, click the + Notification button, select State is ALARM from the Whenever this alarm dropdown menu and choose the AWS SNS topic name created at Step 1 from Send notification to.

  D: In the Alarm Preview section, select 5 Minutes from the Period dropdown list and Sum from the Statistic list.

  E: Review the CloudWatch alarm configuration details then click Create Alarm. Once created, the new alarm will be listed on the Alarms page.
