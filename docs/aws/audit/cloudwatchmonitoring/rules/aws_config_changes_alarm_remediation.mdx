### Remediation

#### Using Console

AWS Config Changes Alarm is triggered when there are changes made to the AWS resources that are being monitored by AWS Config. To remediate this issue, follow these steps:

1. Login to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Config service.

2. Click on the "Rules" option in the left-hand menu.

3. Locate the rule that is triggering the alarm and click on the rule name.

4. Review the rule details and make sure it is configured correctly. If not, update the rule configuration as needed.

5. Click on the "Remediation actions" tab and select the option to "Automatically remediate noncompliant resources".

6. Configure the remediation action based on the specific rule and resource that is triggering the alarm. For example, if the rule is related to security group changes, you may want to automatically revert the security group to its previous state.

7. Save the remediation action and test it by making a change that triggers the alarm. The remediation action should automatically revert the change and resolve the alarm.

8. Monitor the AWS Config Changes Alarm to ensure that it does not trigger again for the same issue. If it does, review the rule configuration and remediation action to ensure they are still valid.

#### Using CLI

The AWS Config Changes Alarm is an AWS Config rule that checks whether an alarm exists for any changes to the AWS resources in your account. If no alarm exists, the rule is non-compliant.

To remediate this misconfiguration, you can follow the below steps using the AWS CLI:

1. List all the rules in your AWS Config:

```
aws configservice describe-config-rules
```

2. Check if the "AWS Config Changes Alarm" rule is non-compliant:

```
aws configservice get-compliance-details-by-config-rule --config-rule-name AWS-Config-Changes-Alarm
```

3. If the rule is non-compliant, create an alarm for AWS Config changes using the AWS CLI:

```
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name AWS-Config-Changes-Alarm --alarm-description "Alarm for AWS Config Changes" --metric-name ConfigurationChanges --namespace AWS/Config --statistic Sum --period 300 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --evaluation-periods 1 --alarm-actions <your-SNS-topic-ARN>
```

Note: Replace `<your-SNS-topic-ARN>` with the ARN of the SNS topic you want to receive the alarm notifications.

4. Verify if the alarm has been created successfully:

```
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names AWS-Config-Changes-Alarm
```

5. Finally, check if the "AWS Config Changes Alarm" rule is compliant:

```
aws configservice get-compliance-details-by-config-rule --config-rule-name AWS-Config-Changes-Alarm
```

If the rule is compliant, then the misconfiguration has been remediated successfully.

#### Using Python

The AWS Config Changes Alarm is triggered when there are changes made to the AWS resources that are being monitored by AWS Config. To remediate this issue, you can create a Lambda function in Python that will automatically respond to the alarm.

Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the AWS Config Changes Alarm using Python:

1. Create an AWS Lambda function: Go to the AWS Management Console, navigate to the Lambda service, and click on the "Create function" button. Choose "Author from scratch", enter a name for the function, and select "Python 3.x" as the runtime.

2. Add the necessary permissions: In the "Permissions" section of the Lambda function, add the "AWS Config" trigger to the function. This will allow the function to be triggered when the AWS Config Changes Alarm is triggered.

3. Write the Python code: In the "Function code" section of the Lambda function, write the Python code to remediate the issue. Here is an example code that will stop and start an EC2 instance when the AWS Config Changes Alarm is triggered:

```
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
    instance_id = event['detail']['configurationItem']['resourceId']
    instance = ec2.Instance(instance_id)
    if event['detail']['configurationItemDiff']['changeType'] == 'CREATE':
        instance.stop()
        instance.wait_until_stopped()
        instance.start()
        instance.wait_until_running()
    elif event['detail']['configurationItemDiff']['changeType'] == 'DELETE':
        instance.start()
        instance.wait_until_running()
```

4. Test the function: Once you have written the code, test the function by triggering the AWS Config Changes Alarm. You should see the Lambda function being triggered and the EC2 instance being stopped and started automatically.

5. Deploy the function: Once you have tested the function, deploy it to your AWS account by clicking on the "Deploy" button in the Lambda console. Make sure to set the appropriate permissions and triggers for the function.

By following these steps, you can easily remediate the AWS Config Changes Alarm using Python and automate the response to this issue.
