### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudWatch service. 

2. In the CloudWatch dashboard, click on "Alarms" in the left-hand navigation pane. 

3. In the Alarms dashboard, you can see a list of all the alarms that have been configured. Look for the AWS Config Changes Alarm. If the state of the alarm is "ALARM", it means that the changes in AWS Config have triggered the alarm.

4. To get more details about the alarm, click on the alarm name. This will open a new page where you can see the metrics and conditions that are associated with the alarm. You can also see the history of the alarm, which shows when and why the alarm state changed.

#### Using CLI

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. **List All CloudWatch Alarms**: You can use the `describe-alarms` command to list all the CloudWatch alarms in your AWS account. The command is as follows:

    ```
    aws cloudwatch describe-alarms
    ```

    This command will return a list of all the CloudWatch alarms along with their details.

3. **Filter AWS Config Changes Alarm**: If you know the name of the AWS Config Changes alarm, you can filter it out from the list of all alarms. You can do this by adding the `--alarm-names` option followed by the name of the alarm. The command is as follows:

    ```
    aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names "Your AWS Config Changes Alarm Name"
    ```

    This command will return the details of the specified alarm.

4. **Check Alarm State**: The state of the alarm can be found in the `StateValue` field of the alarm details. If the `StateValue` is `ALARM`, it means that the alarm condition is met. If it is `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, it means that the alarm has not enough data to determine whether the condition is met. If it is `OK`, it means that the condition is not met.

#### Using Python

1. **Set up AWS SDK and Python Boto3**: First, you need to set up your AWS SDK and Python Boto3. Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials**: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can configure your credentials via the AWS CLI, or by manually creating the file yourself. The default location for the file is `~/.aws/credentials`. At a minimum, the credentials file should look like this:

```python
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

3. **Create a Python Script to Check AWS Config Changes Alarm**: Now, you can create a Python script using Boto3 to check AWS Config Changes Alarm in Cloud Watch. Here is a simple script:

```python
import boto3

def check_config_changes_alarm():
    client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
    response = client.describe_alarms(
        AlarmNames=[
            'ConfigChangesAlarm',
        ]
    )
    alarms = response['MetricAlarms']
    for alarm in alarms:
        print('Alarm Name:', alarm['AlarmName'])
        print('Alarm Description:', alarm['AlarmDescription'])
        print('Alarm State:', alarm['StateValue'])

check_config_changes_alarm()
```

This script will print the name, description, and state of the 'ConfigChangesAlarm' alarm.

4. **Run the Python Script**: Finally, you can run the Python script. If the 'ConfigChangesAlarm' alarm is properly configured and active, it should print its name, description, and state. If the alarm is not configured or inactive, it will not return any information about it.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

AWS Config Changes Alarm is triggered when there are changes made to the AWS resources that are being monitored by AWS Config. To remediate this issue, follow these steps:

1. Login to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Config service.

2. Click on the "Rules" option in the left-hand menu.

3. Locate the rule that is triggering the alarm and click on the rule name.

4. Review the rule details and make sure it is configured correctly. If not, update the rule configuration as needed.

5. Click on the "Remediation actions" tab and select the option to "Automatically remediate noncompliant resources".

6. Configure the remediation action based on the specific rule and resource that is triggering the alarm. For example, if the rule is related to security group changes, you may want to automatically revert the security group to its previous state.

7. Save the remediation action and test it by making a change that triggers the alarm. The remediation action should automatically revert the change and resolve the alarm.

8. Monitor the AWS Config Changes Alarm to ensure that it does not trigger again for the same issue. If it does, review the rule configuration and remediation action to ensure they are still valid.

#### Using CLI

The AWS Config Changes Alarm is an AWS Config rule that checks whether an alarm exists for any changes to the AWS resources in your account. If no alarm exists, the rule is non-compliant.

To remediate this misconfiguration, you can follow the below steps using the AWS CLI:

1. List all the rules in your AWS Config:

```
aws configservice describe-config-rules
```

2. Check if the "AWS Config Changes Alarm" rule is non-compliant:

```
aws configservice get-compliance-details-by-config-rule --config-rule-name AWS-Config-Changes-Alarm
```

3. If the rule is non-compliant, create an alarm for AWS Config changes using the AWS CLI:

```
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name AWS-Config-Changes-Alarm --alarm-description "Alarm for AWS Config Changes" --metric-name ConfigurationChanges --namespace AWS/Config --statistic Sum --period 300 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --evaluation-periods 1 --alarm-actions <your-SNS-topic-ARN>
```

Note: Replace `<your-SNS-topic-ARN>` with the ARN of the SNS topic you want to receive the alarm notifications.

4. Verify if the alarm has been created successfully:

```
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names AWS-Config-Changes-Alarm
```

5. Finally, check if the "AWS Config Changes Alarm" rule is compliant:

```
aws configservice get-compliance-details-by-config-rule --config-rule-name AWS-Config-Changes-Alarm
```

If the rule is compliant, then the misconfiguration has been remediated successfully.

#### Using Python

The AWS Config Changes Alarm is triggered when there are changes made to the AWS resources that are being monitored by AWS Config. To remediate this issue, you can create a Lambda function in Python that will automatically respond to the alarm.

Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the AWS Config Changes Alarm using Python:

1. Create an AWS Lambda function: Go to the AWS Management Console, navigate to the Lambda service, and click on the "Create function" button. Choose "Author from scratch", enter a name for the function, and select "Python 3.x" as the runtime.

2. Add the necessary permissions: In the "Permissions" section of the Lambda function, add the "AWS Config" trigger to the function. This will allow the function to be triggered when the AWS Config Changes Alarm is triggered.

3. Write the Python code: In the "Function code" section of the Lambda function, write the Python code to remediate the issue. Here is an example code that will stop and start an EC2 instance when the AWS Config Changes Alarm is triggered:

```
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
    instance_id = event['detail']['configurationItem']['resourceId']
    instance = ec2.Instance(instance_id)
    if event['detail']['configurationItemDiff']['changeType'] == 'CREATE':
        instance.stop()
        instance.wait_until_stopped()
        instance.start()
        instance.wait_until_running()
    elif event['detail']['configurationItemDiff']['changeType'] == 'DELETE':
        instance.start()
        instance.wait_until_running()
```

4. Test the function: Once you have written the code, test the function by triggering the AWS Config Changes Alarm. You should see the Lambda function being triggered and the EC2 instance being stopped and started automatically.

5. Deploy the function: Once you have tested the function, deploy it to your AWS account by clicking on the "Deploy" button in the Lambda console. Make sure to set the appropriate permissions and triggers for the function.

By following these steps, you can easily remediate the AWS Config Changes Alarm using Python and automate the response to this issue.
