How to create CloudWatch IAM Policy Changes alarm?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudWatch service.
2. Click on "Alarms" in the navigation panel on the left side.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "IAM Policy Changes Alarm" Policy.)
3. Click on the "Create alarm" button.
4. In the "Create Alarm" wizard, under "Select metric," search for and select the "IAM Policies" metric.
5. Configure the conditions for the alarm:
   a. In the "Conditions" section, select the IAM policy you want to monitor for changes. You can choose a specific policy or use a wildcard (*) to monitor changes to all policies.
   b. Specify the threshold for triggering the alarm. For example, you can set it to "Any data point is greater than 0" to trigger the alarm when any policy changes occur.
6. In the "Actions" section, select the actions you want to take when the alarm state is triggered. You can choose options like sending a notification, executing an AWS Lambda function, or stopping or terminating instances.
7. Under the "Alarm state trigger" section, provide a name and description for the alarm.
8. Configure the notification settings if desired. You can select an existing SNS topic or create a new one to receive notifications when the alarm state is triggered.
9. Click on the "Create alarm" button to create the IAM policy changes alarm.
10. You will be redirected to the alarm list, where you can see the newly created alarm.
