How to create the necessary metric filter and attach it to the VPC Flow Logs CloudWatch log group available in AWS account?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: In the left navigation panel, click Logs groups to access the log groups available in the current AWS region.

- Step 2: Select the VPC Flow Logs CloudWatch log group that you want to configure (see Audit section steps no. 1 to identify the right log group) and click on the "number" filter link, available in the Metric filters column, to access the metric filters page for the selected group. If the log group does not have any metric filter defined, the filter link will not be displayed on UI.

- Step 3: On Filters for <vpc_flow_log_group_name> page, click Create metric filter to initiate the metric filter setup process.

- Step 4: On Create metric filter and Define pattern step, in the Filter Pattern box, enter the following pattern: { $.errorCode = "AccessDenied" }. Click Next to continue the process.

- Step 5: On Create metric filter and Assign metric step, provide a name for the selected filter in the Filter Name box, a name to group similar metrics in the Metric namespace box, a unique name for the assigned metric within the Metric Name box and a value in the Metric value box. Click Next to continue the process.

- Step 6: On Create metric filter and Review and create step, review it then click Create metric filter to generate the new metric filter that matches the pattern of the rejected IP traffic and attach it to the AWS CloudWatch log group assigned to VPC Flow Logs.
