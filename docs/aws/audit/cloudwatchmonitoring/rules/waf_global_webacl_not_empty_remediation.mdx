1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS WAF & Shield service.

2. In the navigation pane, select "WebACLs". This will display a list of all your Web Access Control Lists (WebACLs).

3. Select the WebACL that you want to check. This will open the details page for that WebACL.

4. In the "Rules" section, check if there are any global rules applied. If the section is empty, it means that no global rules are applied, indicating a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "aws waf list-web-acls" command to list all the WebACLs in your AWS account. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws waf list-web-acls --limit 100
   ```
   This command will return a list of WebACLs with their IDs.

3. Now, for each WebACL ID, you can use the "aws waf get-web-acl" command to get the details of the WebACL. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws waf get-web-acl --web-acl-id <WebACL_ID>
   ```
   Replace `<WebACL_ID>` with the ID of the WebACL you want to check. This command will return the details of the WebACL including the rules.

4. Finally, you can check the "Rules" field in the output of the previous command. If the "Rules" field is empty, then the WAF Global Rules are empty for that WebACL. If the "Rules" field is not empty, then the WAF Global Rules are not empty for that WebACL.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if WAF Global Rules are not empty in AWS CloudWatch using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Setup AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to set up Boto3. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script to List WAF Rules:**
   You can use the `list_rules` method of the WAF client in Boto3 to list all the WAF rules. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('waf')

   response = client.list_rules()

   print(response)
   ```
   This script will print all the WAF rules.

3. **Check if WAF Global Rules are Empty:**
   You can modify the above script to check if the WAF Global Rules are empty. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('waf')

   response = client.list_rules()

   for rule in response['Rules']:
       if not rule['Predicates']:
           print(f"Rule {rule['RuleId']} is empty.")
   ```
   This script will print the IDs of all the rules that are empty.

4. **Run the Python Script:**
   Finally, you can run the Python script using the following command:
   ```
   python script_name.py
   ```
   Replace `script_name.py` with the name of your Python script. The script will print the IDs of all the WAF Global Rules that are empty.

### Remediation
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of WAF Global Rules being empty in AWS CloudWatch, you can follow these step-by-step instructions using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to your AWS account using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to AWS WAF**: In the AWS Management Console, search for "WAF" in the services search bar and click on "AWS WAF" to open the AWS WAF console.

3. **Select the Web ACL**: In the AWS WAF console, click on "Web ACLs" in the left-hand navigation pane. Select the Web ACL that you want to configure the global rules for.

4. **Add Global Rules**: Within the selected Web ACL, click on the "Rules" tab. Here you will see the list of rules configured for the Web ACL.

5. **Add a New Rule**: Click on the "Add rules" button to add a new rule to the Web ACL.

6. **Configure Global Rule**: In the rule configuration window, select the rule type as "Global Rule" from the drop-down menu.

7. **Define Rule Criteria**: Define the criteria for the global rule based on your security requirements. This could include conditions like IP addresses, URI paths, query strings, etc.

8. **Set Rule Action**: Choose the appropriate action to be taken when the global rule conditions are met. This could be to allow, block, or count the request.

9. **Review and Save**: Review the configured global rule settings to ensure they align with your security policies. Once confirmed, click on the "Save" button to add the global rule to the Web ACL.

10. **Verify Configuration**: After adding the global rule, ensure that it is listed under the rules section of the Web ACL and that it is properly configured.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rules in AWS CloudWatch and enhance the security of your web applications.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rules in AWS Cloud Watch using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. List the current WAF Global Rules in AWS Cloud Watch using the following AWS CLI command:
```
aws wafv2 list-web-acls --scope REGIONAL
```

2. Identify the Web ACL that has empty global rules.

3. Update the Web ACL by adding appropriate global rules. You can create a new global rule or update existing ones using the AWS CLI command. For example, to create a new global rule, you can use the following command:

```
aws wafv2 create-rule-group --name "MyGlobalRule" --scope REGIONAL --capacity 100 --rules file://global_rules.json
```

Make sure to replace "MyGlobalRule" with the desired name for the rule group and provide the rule definitions in the JSON file "global_rules.json".

4. Associate the newly created global rule with the Web ACL using the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws wafv2 associate-web-acl --web-acl-arn <web_acl_arn> --web-acl-name <web_acl_name> --scope REGIONAL
```

Replace `<web_acl_arn>` and `<web_acl_name>` with the ARN and name of the Web ACL that needs to be updated.

5. Verify that the global rules are no longer empty by listing the Web ACLs again using the command in step 1.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rules in AWS Cloud Watch using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rules in AWS CloudWatch using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Boto3**: Make sure you have Boto3 installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up Boto3 Credentials**: Ensure that you have set up your AWS credentials for Boto3 to access your AWS account. You can set up your credentials using AWS CLI or environment variables.

3. **Write Python Code**: Use the following Python code to associate a Global WebACL with a WAF:

```python
import boto3

def associate_global_webacl_to_waf(web_acl_arn, waf_name):
    # Initialize the WAF client
    wafv2_client = boto3.client('wafv2')

    # Get the ARN of the resource associated with the WAF
    waf_resource_response = wafv2_client.get_web_acl(
        Name=waf_name
    )
    waf_resource_arn = waf_resource_response['WebACL']['ARN']

    # Associate the Global WebACL with the WAF
    response = wafv2_client.associate_web_acl(
        WebACLArn=web_acl_arn,
        ResourceArn=waf_resource_arn
    )

    print("Global WebACL associated with WAF successfully.")

def main():
    # Specify the ARN of the Global WebACL
    web_acl_arn = 'arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleGlobalWebACL'

    # Specify the name of the WAF to associate with
    waf_name = 'ExampleWAF'

    # Associate Global WebACL with WAF
    associate_global_webacl_to_waf(web_acl_arn, waf_name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Replace `'arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleGlobalWebACL'` with the ARN of your Global WebACL, and `'ExampleWAF'` with the name of the WAF you want to associate with. 

4. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script. Upon successful execution, the Global WebACL will be associated with the specified WAF.

This script will use Boto3 to call the `associate_web_acl` method of the WAFv2 client, passing in the ARNs of the Global WebACL and the WAF resource to perform the association.
