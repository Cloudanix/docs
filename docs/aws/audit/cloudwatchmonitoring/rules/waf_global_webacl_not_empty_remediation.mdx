<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration "WAF Global Rules Should Not Be Empty" in AWS using the AWS CLI, you need to ensure that your Web Application Firewall (WAF) has rules defined. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Create a Web ACL:**
   First, create a Web ACL if you don't already have one. This Web ACL will be used to associate rules.

   ```sh
   aws wafv2 create-web-acl --name <web-acl-name> --scope GLOBAL --default-action Allow={} --visibility-config SampledRequestsEnabled=true,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=true,MetricName=<metric-name> --region <region>
   ```

2. **Create a Rule:**
   Create a rule that you want to add to your Web ACL. For example, you can create a rate-based rule to limit the number of requests from a single IP address.

   ```sh
   aws wafv2 create-rule --name <rule-name> --scope GLOBAL --visibility-config SampledRequestsEnabled=true,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=true,MetricName=<metric-name> --statement RateBasedStatement={Limit=1000,AggregateKeyType=IP} --action Block={} --region <region>
   ```

3. **Associate the Rule with the Web ACL:**
   Once you have created the rule, you need to associate it with your Web ACL.

   ```sh
   aws wafv2 update-web-acl --name <web-acl-name> --scope GLOBAL --default-action Allow={} --visibility-config SampledRequestsEnabled=true,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=true,MetricName=<metric-name> --rules "RuleArn=<rule-arn>,Priority=1,Action={Block={}},VisibilityConfig={SampledRequestsEnabled=true,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=true,MetricName=<metric-name>}" --region <region>
   ```

4. **Verify the Configuration:**
   Finally, verify that the Web ACL has the rule associated with it.

   ```sh
   aws wafv2 get-web-acl --name <web-acl-name> --scope GLOBAL --region <region>
   ```

Replace `<web-acl-name>`, `<rule-name>`, `<metric-name>`, `<rule-arn>`, and `<region>` with your specific values. This will ensure that your WAF Global Rules are not empty and are properly configured.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of having empty WAF (Web Application Firewall) Global Rules in AWS CloudWatch using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   - Ensure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install boto3
     ```

2. **Create a WAF Client:**
   - Initialize a WAF client using Boto3 to interact with AWS WAF.
     ```python
     import boto3

     waf_client = boto3.client('waf')
     ```

3. **Check and Update WAF Global Rules:**
   - Write a function to check if the WAF Global Rules are empty and update them if necessary.
     ```python
     def ensure_waf_global_rules_not_empty(web_acl_id):
         response = waf_client.get_web_acl(
             WebACLId=web_acl_id
         )
         
         rules = response['WebACL']['Rules']
         
         if not rules:
             # Add a default rule or a specific rule to ensure it's not empty
             default_rule = {
                 'Action': {'Type': 'ALLOW'},
                 'Priority': 1,
                 'RuleId': 'example-rule-id',  # Replace with your actual rule ID
                 'Type': 'REGULAR'
             }
             
             waf_client.update_web_acl(
                 WebACLId=web_acl_id,
                 ChangeToken=waf_client.get_change_token()['ChangeToken'],
                 Updates=[
                     {
                         'Action': 'INSERT',
                         'ActivatedRule': default_rule
                     }
                 ]
             )
             print("Added default rule to WAF Global Rules.")
         else:
             print("WAF Global Rules are not empty.")
     ```

4. **Execute the Script:**
   - Call the function with the appropriate WebACL ID to ensure the WAF Global Rules are not empty.
     ```python
     web_acl_id = 'your-web-acl-id'  # Replace with your actual WebACL ID
     ensure_waf_global_rules_not_empty(web_acl_id)
     ```

By following these steps, you can programmatically ensure that your WAF Global Rules are not empty, thus preventing the misconfiguration using Python scripts.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS WAF & Shield service.

2. In the navigation pane, select "WebACLs". This will display a list of all your Web Access Control Lists (WebACLs).

3. Select the WebACL that you want to check. This will open the details page for that WebACL.

4. In the "Rules" section, check if there are any global rules applied. If the section is empty, it means that no global rules are applied, indicating a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "aws waf list-web-acls" command to list all the WebACLs in your AWS account. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws waf list-web-acls --limit 100
   ```
   This command will return a list of WebACLs with their IDs.

3. Now, for each WebACL ID, you can use the "aws waf get-web-acl" command to get the details of the WebACL. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws waf get-web-acl --web-acl-id <WebACL_ID>
   ```
   Replace `<WebACL_ID>` with the ID of the WebACL you want to check. This command will return the details of the WebACL including the rules.

4. Finally, you can check the "Rules" field in the output of the previous command. If the "Rules" field is empty, then the WAF Global Rules are empty for that WebACL. If the "Rules" field is not empty, then the WAF Global Rules are not empty for that WebACL.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if WAF Global Rules are not empty in AWS CloudWatch using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Setup AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to set up Boto3. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script to List WAF Rules:**
   You can use the `list_rules` method of the WAF client in Boto3 to list all the WAF rules. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('waf')

   response = client.list_rules()

   print(response)
   ```
   This script will print all the WAF rules.

3. **Check if WAF Global Rules are Empty:**
   You can modify the above script to check if the WAF Global Rules are empty. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('waf')

   response = client.list_rules()

   for rule in response['Rules']:
       if not rule['Predicates']:
           print(f"Rule {rule['RuleId']} is empty.")
   ```
   This script will print the IDs of all the rules that are empty.

4. **Run the Python Script:**
   Finally, you can run the Python script using the following command:
   ```
   python script_name.py
   ```
   Replace `script_name.py` with the name of your Python script. The script will print the IDs of all the WAF Global Rules that are empty.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rules in AWS Cloud Watch using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. List the current WAF Global Rules in AWS Cloud Watch using the following AWS CLI command:
```
aws wafv2 list-web-acls --scope REGIONAL
```

2. Identify the Web ACL that has empty global rules.

3. Update the Web ACL by adding appropriate global rules. You can create a new global rule or update existing ones using the AWS CLI command. For example, to create a new global rule, you can use the following command:

```
aws wafv2 create-rule-group --name "MyGlobalRule" --scope REGIONAL --capacity 100 --rules file://global_rules.json
```

Make sure to replace "MyGlobalRule" with the desired name for the rule group and provide the rule definitions in the JSON file "global_rules.json".

4. Associate the newly created global rule with the Web ACL using the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws wafv2 associate-web-acl --web-acl-arn <web_acl_arn> --web-acl-name <web_acl_name> --scope REGIONAL
```

Replace `<web_acl_arn>` and `<web_acl_name>` with the ARN and name of the Web ACL that needs to be updated.

5. Verify that the global rules are no longer empty by listing the Web ACLs again using the command in step 1.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of empty WAF Global Rules in AWS Cloud Watch using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To associate a Global WebACL with a Web Application Firewall (WAF) using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Below is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Boto3**: Make sure you have Boto3 installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up Boto3 Credentials**: Ensure that you have set up your AWS credentials for Boto3 to access your AWS account. You can set up your credentials using AWS CLI or environment variables.

3. **Write Python Code**: Use the following Python code to associate a Global WebACL with a WAF:

```python
import boto3

def associate_global_webacl_to_waf(web_acl_arn, waf_name):
    # Initialize the WAF client
    wafv2_client = boto3.client('wafv2')

    # Get the ARN of the resource associated with the WAF
    waf_resource_response = wafv2_client.get_web_acl(
        Name=waf_name
    )
    waf_resource_arn = waf_resource_response['WebACL']['ARN']

    # Associate the Global WebACL with the WAF
    response = wafv2_client.associate_web_acl(
        WebACLArn=web_acl_arn,
        ResourceArn=waf_resource_arn
    )

    print("Global WebACL associated with WAF successfully.")

def main():
    # Specify the ARN of the Global WebACL
    web_acl_arn = 'arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleGlobalWebACL'

    # Specify the name of the WAF to associate with
    waf_name = 'ExampleWAF'

    # Associate Global WebACL with WAF
    associate_global_webacl_to_waf(web_acl_arn, waf_name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Replace `'arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleGlobalWebACL'` with the ARN of your Global WebACL, and `'ExampleWAF'` with the name of the WAF you want to associate with. 

4. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script. Upon successful execution, the Global WebACL will be associated with the specified WAF.

This script will use Boto3 to call the `associate_web_acl` method of the WAFv2 client, passing in the ARNs of the Global WebACL and the WAF resource to perform the association.
