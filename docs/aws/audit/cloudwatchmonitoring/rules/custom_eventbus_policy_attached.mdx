#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Events", then "Event buses".

3. In the "Event buses" section, select the name of the custom EventBus you want to check.

4. In the "Resource policy" section, you can see the policy attached to the EventBus. If there is no policy attached, it means there is a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all the Event Buses: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the custom event buses in your account:

   ```
   aws events list-event-buses
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the custom event buses in your account. Note down the name of the event bus you want to check the resource policy attachment for.

3. Describe the Event Bus: Use the following AWS CLI command to describe the event bus and get its details including the resource policy:

   ```
   aws events describe-event-bus --name <EventBusName>
   ```
   Replace `<EventBusName>` with the name of your event bus. This command will return the details of the event bus including the resource policy if it is attached.

4. Check the Resource Policy: In the output of the previous command, look for the "Policy" field. If the policy field is present and contains a policy, it means that a resource policy is attached to the event bus. If the policy field is not present or is empty, it means that no resource policy is attached to the event bus.

#### Using Python

To check Resource Policy Attachment in Custom EventBus in Cloud Watch using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary modules and create a session:**

    You need to import Boto3 and create a session using your AWS credentials. 

    ```python
    import boto3

    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
        region_name='us-west-2'
    )
    ```

2. **Create a CloudWatch client:**

    Use the session to create a CloudWatch client.

    ```python
    cloudwatch = session.client('cloudwatch')
    ```

3. **List all the Event Buses:**

    Use the `list_event_buses` method to get all the custom event buses.

    ```python
    response = cloudwatch.list_event_buses()
    ```

4. **Check the Resource Policy Attachment for each EventBus:**

    Iterate over the event buses and use the `describe_event_bus` method to get the policy for each bus. If the policy is None, then there is no Resource Policy Attachment.

    ```python
    for bus in response['EventBuses']:
        bus_name = bus['Name']
        bus_details = cloudwatch.describe_event_bus(Name=bus_name)
        policy = bus_details.get('Policy')
        if policy is None:
            print(f'No Resource Policy Attachment in EventBus: {bus_name}')
    ```

This script will print the names of all the custom event buses that do not have a Resource Policy Attachment.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Resource Policy Attachment in a Custom EventBus for AWS CloudWatch using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and login with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to CloudWatch**: Click on the "Services" dropdown in the top left corner, search for "CloudWatch" in the search bar, and click on "CloudWatch" to open the CloudWatch dashboard.

3. **Select Event Buses**: In the CloudWatch dashboard, locate the "Event Buses" option in the left-hand menu and click on it.

4. **Select Custom EventBus**: Find the Custom EventBus that has the misconfigured Resource Policy Attachment and click on it to select it.

5. **Edit Resource Policy**: Locate the "Event bus policy" section and click on the "Edit policy" button to modify the Resource Policy Attachment.

6. **Update Resource Policy**: In the policy editor, review the existing policy and make necessary changes to ensure that only authorized resources have permission to access the Custom EventBus. You can use the AWS Policy Generator to create a new policy if needed.

7. **Save Changes**: After updating the Resource Policy Attachment, click on the "Save changes" button to apply the new policy to the Custom EventBus.

8. **Verify Configuration**: Once the policy is updated, verify that the Resource Policy Attachment is correctly configured by checking the permissions and access controls for the Custom EventBus.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Resource Policy Attachment in a Custom EventBus for AWS CloudWatch using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of resource policy attachment in a custom EventBus for AWS CloudWatch using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. List the existing Event Buses in your AWS account to identify the custom EventBus that has the misconfigured resource policy. Run the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws events list-event-buses
```

2. Identify the custom EventBus that has the misconfigured resource policy attachment.

3. Remove the existing resource policy attachment from the custom EventBus using the following AWS CLI command. Replace `<event-bus-name>` with the name of the custom EventBus identified in step 2:

```
aws events remove-permission --statement-id default --event-bus-name <event-bus-name>
```

4. Verify that the resource policy attachment has been successfully removed by listing the permissions for the custom EventBus using the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws events describe-event-bus --name <event-bus-name>
```

5. If the resource policy attachment is successfully removed, you can now add the correct resource policy to the custom EventBus. Create a new resource policy document in JSON format and save it to a file (e.g., `resource-policy.json`). Here is an example of a resource policy that allows CloudWatch events:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "events.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "events:PutEvents",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:events:us-east-1:123456789012:event-bus/<event-bus-name>"
    }
  ]
}
```

6. Attach the new resource policy to the custom EventBus using the following AWS CLI command. Replace `<event-bus-name>` with the name of the custom EventBus:

```
aws events put-permission --event-bus-name <event-bus-name> --action events:PutEvents --principal events.amazonaws.com --statement-id default --policy file://resource-policy.json
```

7. Verify that the new resource policy has been successfully attached to the custom EventBus by listing the permissions for the custom EventBus using the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws events describe-event-bus --name <event-bus-name>
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of resource policy attachment in a custom EventBus for AWS CloudWatch using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of a resource policy attachment in a custom EventBus in AWS CloudWatch using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Misconfigured Resource Policy**: First, identify the custom EventBus in CloudWatch that has the misconfigured resource policy attachment. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list the EventBuses and their associated resource policies.

2. **Remove the Misconfigured Resource Policy**: Use the `remove_permission` method from Boto3 to remove the misconfigured resource policy attachment from the custom EventBus. You will need to specify the EventBus name and the statement ID of the resource policy to be removed.

3. **Example Python Code**:
   
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize the CloudWatch Events client
   cloudwatch_events = boto3.client('events')

   # Specify the name of the custom EventBus with the misconfigured resource policy
   event_bus_name = 'your-custom-event-bus-name'
   
   # Specify the statement ID of the misconfigured resource policy to be removed
   statement_id = 'your-misconfigured-statement-id'

   # Remove the misconfigured resource policy from the custom EventBus
   response = cloudwatch_events.remove_permission(
       StatementId=statement_id,
       EventBusName=event_bus_name
   )

   print('Resource policy removed successfully')
   ```
   
4. **Run the Python Script**: Execute the Python script on your local machine or in an AWS Lambda function to remove the misconfigured resource policy attachment from the custom EventBus in CloudWatch.

5. **Verify Remediation**: After running the script, verify that the resource policy attachment has been successfully removed from the custom EventBus by listing the EventBuses and checking the resource policies.

By following these steps and using the provided Python script, you can effectively remediate the misconfiguration of a resource policy attachment in a custom EventBus in AWS CloudWatch.
