### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Firewall Manager service.

2. In the AWS Firewall Manager dashboard, check the AWS Shield Advanced section. Here, you can see the AWS accounts and resources that are protected by AWS Shield Advanced.

3. Click on the "Security policies" tab. Here, you can see all the security policies that are currently in place. Look for the FMS Shield Resource Policy.

4. If the FMS Shield Resource Policy is not listed, or if it is listed but not enabled, then it is a misconfiguration. The policy should be enabled to protect your AWS resources from DDoS attacks.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "describe-policies" command to list all the AWS Firewall Manager policies in your account. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws fms list-policies
   ```

3. The output of the above command will be a JSON object containing details of all the Firewall Manager policies. You need to check if the "ShieldAdvanced" policy is enabled. You can do this by looking for the "PolicyName" field in the output and checking if its value is "AWSManagedRulesAmazonIpReputationList".

4. If the "ShieldAdvanced" policy is not enabled, it means the FMS Shield Resource Policy is not enabled. If it is enabled, you will see the details of the policy including the policy ID, policy name, security service type (should be "SHIELD_ADVANCED"), and the policy update token.

#### Using Python

To check if FMS Shield Resource Policy is enabled in Cloud Watch using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Set up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_key'
   ```

2. **Create a Python script to list all FMS policies:**
   You can use the `list_policies` method of the FMS client to get a list of all FMS policies. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_fms_policies():
       client = boto3.client('fms')
       response = client.list_policies()
       return response['PolicySummaryList']

   policies = list_fms_policies()
   for policy in policies:
       print(policy)
   ```

3. **Check if Shield Resource Policy is enabled:**
   The `list_policies` method returns a list of policy summaries. Each summary includes the policy ID, the policy name, and the policy type. You can check if the Shield Resource Policy is enabled by checking if there is a policy with the type 'SHIELD_RESOURCE_POLICY'. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def is_shield_resource_policy_enabled():
       client = boto3.client('fms')
       response = client.list_policies()
       for policy in response['PolicySummaryList']:
           if policy['PolicyType'] == 'SHIELD_RESOURCE_POLICY':
               return True
       return False

   print(is_shield_resource_policy_enabled())
   ```

4. **Handle exceptions:**
   The above script does not handle any exceptions. In a real-world scenario, you should add error handling to your script. For example, you should handle the case where the AWS credentials are not set correctly, or the case where the FMS service is not available in the current region.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not having FMS Shield Resource Policy enabled for AWS CloudWatch using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to AWS CloudWatch**: Click on the "Services" dropdown at the top of the page, then select "CloudWatch" under the Management & Governance section.

3. **Enable FMS Shield Resource Policy**:
   - In the CloudWatch console, click on "Alarms" in the left-hand navigation pane.
   - Click on the alarm that you want to enable FMS Shield Resource Policy for.
   - In the alarm details page, click on the "Actions" dropdown and select "Edit".
   - Scroll down to the "FMS Shield Resource Policy" section.
   - Click on the toggle button to enable the FMS Shield Resource Policy.
   - Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

4. **Verify the FMS Shield Resource Policy is enabled**:
   - Once you have enabled the FMS Shield Resource Policy for the alarm, you can verify that it is enabled by checking the alarm details and ensuring that the FMS Shield Resource Policy toggle is set to enabled.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration of not having FMS Shield Resource Policy enabled for AWS CloudWatch using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To enable FMS Shield Resource Policy for AWS CloudWatch using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and ensure that you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions to make changes to AWS resources.

2. Run the following AWS CLI command to enable FMS Shield Resource Policy for AWS CloudWatch:

```
aws fms put-policy --policy-id AWSManagedRulesCommonFWRuleSet --resource-type RESOURCE_TYPE --resource-id RESOURCE_ID
```

Replace `RESOURCE_TYPE` with the type of AWS resource you want to protect (e.g., `AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm`) and `RESOURCE_ID` with the specific resource ID you want to apply the policy to.

3. Verify that the FMS Shield Resource Policy has been successfully enabled for AWS CloudWatch by running the following command:

```
aws fms list-policies
```

You should see the newly created policy in the list of policies returned by this command.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration and enable FMS Shield Resource Policy for AWS CloudWatch using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of FMS Shield Resource Policy not being enabled for AWS CloudWatch using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update the resource policy. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. Install Boto3:
   If you haven't already installed Boto3, you can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Create a Python script with the following code to enable the FMS Shield Resource Policy for CloudWatch:

```python
import boto3

def enable_fms_shield_policy():
    # Create a CloudWatch client
    cloudwatch_client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

    # Enable the FMS Shield Resource Policy for CloudWatch
    response = cloudwatch_client.put_metric_policy(
        PolicyName='FMS-Shield-Policy',
        PolicyDocument='{"Version": "2012-10-17","Statement": [{"Effect": "Allow","Principal": {"Service": "shield.amazonaws.com"},"Action": "cloudwatch:PutMetricData","Resource": "*"}]}'
    )

    print('FMS Shield Resource Policy has been enabled for CloudWatch.')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    enable_fms_shield_policy()
```

3. Run the Python script:
   Save the Python script with a `.py` extension and run it using the Python interpreter. Make sure your AWS credentials are properly configured on your system.

   ```
   python enable_fms_shield_policy.py
   ```

4. Verify the policy:
   After running the script, verify that the FMS Shield Resource Policy has been successfully enabled for CloudWatch by checking the CloudWatch console or by listing the CloudWatch resource policies using the AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch list-metric-policies
   ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of the FMS Shield Resource Policy not being enabled for AWS CloudWatch using Python and Boto3.
