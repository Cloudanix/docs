<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent AWS Console Sign In Without MFA Should Be Monitored in CloudWatch using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

1. **Create a CloudWatch Log Group:**
   - Navigate to the **CloudWatch** service in the AWS Management Console.
   - In the left-hand menu, select **Logs**.
   - Click on **Create log group** and provide a name for the log group (e.g., `MFA-SignIn-Logs`).

2. **Enable CloudTrail Logging:**
   - Go to the **CloudTrail** service in the AWS Management Console.
   - In the left-hand menu, select **Trails**.
   - If you don't have a trail, click on **Create trail**. If you already have a trail, select it.
   - Ensure that **Management events** are enabled and that **Read/Write events** are set to **All**.
   - Under **Storage location**, ensure that **Send to CloudWatch Logs** is enabled and select the log group you created earlier.

3. **Create a CloudWatch Metric Filter:**
   - In the CloudWatch console, go to **Logs** and select the log group you created.
   - Click on **Create metric filter**.
   - In the **Filter pattern** box, enter the following pattern to capture sign-in events without MFA:
     ```
     { $.eventName = "ConsoleLogin" && $.additionalEventData.MFAUsed != "Yes" }
     ```
   - Click on **Next** and provide a name for the filter (e.g., `NoMFAConsoleSignIn`).
   - Define a metric namespace and metric name (e.g., `MFA/SignInFailures`).

4. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm:**
   - In the CloudWatch console, go to **Alarms** and click on **Create alarm**.
   - Select the metric you created in the previous step.
   - Configure the alarm to trigger when the metric value is greater than or equal to 1.
   - Set up notifications (e.g., via SNS) to alert you when the alarm is triggered.

By following these steps, you will have set up monitoring for AWS Console Sign-Ins without MFA using CloudWatch.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent AWS Console Sign In Without MFA from going unmonitored in CloudWatch using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)
First, ensure you have Boto3 installed and configured with the necessary permissions to interact with AWS services.

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### 2. Create a CloudWatch Log Group
Create a CloudWatch log group where the sign-in events will be logged.

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('logs')

response = client.create_log_group(
    logGroupName='MFA_SignIn_Logs'
)
print(response)
```

### 3. Enable CloudTrail and Configure it to Log to CloudWatch
Ensure CloudTrail is enabled and configured to log events to the CloudWatch log group created in the previous step.

```python
client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')

response = client.create_trail(
    Name='MFA_SignIn_Trail',
    S3BucketName='your-s3-bucket-name',
    CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn='arn:aws:logs:your-region:your-account-id:log-group:MFA_SignIn_Logs',
    CloudWatchLogsRoleArn='arn:aws:iam::your-account-id:role/CloudTrail_CloudWatchLogs_Role'
)
print(response)

response = client.start_logging(
    Name='MFA_SignIn_Trail'
)
print(response)
```

### 4. Create a CloudWatch Metric Filter and Alarm
Create a metric filter to look for sign-in events without MFA and set up an alarm to notify you.

```python
import boto3

logs_client = boto3.client('logs')
cloudwatch_client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

# Create Metric Filter
response = logs_client.put_metric_filter(
    logGroupName='MFA_SignIn_Logs',
    filterName='SignInWithoutMFA',
    filterPattern='{ ($.eventName = "ConsoleLogin") && ($.additionalEventData.MFAUsed != "Yes") }',
    metricTransformations=[
        {
            'metricName': 'SignInWithoutMFA',
            'metricNamespace': 'MFA_Monitoring',
            'metricValue': '1'
        },
    ]
)
print(response)

# Create Alarm
response = cloudwatch_client.put_metric_alarm(
    AlarmName='SignInWithoutMFAAlarm',
    MetricName='SignInWithoutMFA',
    Namespace='MFA_Monitoring',
    Statistic='Sum',
    Period=300,
    EvaluationPeriods=1,
    Threshold=1,
    ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold',
    AlarmActions=[
        'arn:aws:sns:your-region:your-account-id:your-sns-topic'
    ],
    AlarmDescription='Alarm when there is a console sign-in without MFA',
    ActionsEnabled=True
)
print(response)
```

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.

2. In the navigation pane, click on "Alarms" and then "Create Alarm".

3. In the "Create Alarm" wizard, select "Select metric". Under the "AWS Namespaces" section, select "CloudTrail" and then "Event count". 

4. Configure the alarm properties. Under "Conditions", set the "Threshold type" to "Static". For "Whenever: CloudTrail Event count", set "is" to "Greater/Equal" and ": than" to "1". Under "Additional configuration", set "Datapoints to alarm" to "1 out of 1". This will trigger the alarm if any single data point is above the threshold. 

Note: This alarm will only trigger if AWS CloudTrail is configured to log console sign-in events and if MFA is not used for sign-in.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Once you have AWS CLI installed and configured, you can proceed to the next steps.

2. Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the users in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws iam list-users
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the users in your AWS account.

3. For each user, you need to check if they have MFA enabled. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

   ```
   aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name <username>
   ```

   Replace `<username>` with the name of the user. This command will return a list of all the MFA devices associated with the user. If the list is empty, it means that the user does not have MFA enabled.

4. To monitor AWS Console Sign In Without MFA, you can use AWS CloudWatch. You can create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers whenever a user signs in without MFA. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name "SignInWithoutMFA" --metric-name "ConsoleSignInsWithoutMFA" --namespace "AWS/SignIn" --statistic "SampleCount" --period 300 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold" --evaluation-periods 1 --alarm-actions <arn-of-sns-topic>
   ```

   Replace `<arn-of-sns-topic>` with the ARN of the SNS topic where you want to receive the alarm notifications. This command will create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers whenever a user signs in without MFA.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Set up AWS SDK and Boto3 in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up your Python environment with AWS SDK and Boto3. Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing, configure your AWS credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using the AWS CLI.

2. **Import Necessary Libraries and Establish a CloudWatch Client:**
   Import the necessary libraries and establish a connection to AWS CloudWatch. Here's a basic example:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create CloudWatch client
   cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
   ```

3. **Create a Metric Filter:**
   You need to create a metric filter in CloudWatch logs that matches the event of a console sign-in without MFA. The filter pattern for this event is `{ $.eventName = "ConsoleLogin" && $.additionalEventData.MFAUsed = "No" }`. Here's how you can create a metric filter using Boto3:
   ```python
   response = cloudwatch.put_metric_filter(
       logGroupName='log_group_name',
       filterName='ConsoleSignInWithoutMFA',
       filterPattern='{ $.eventName = "ConsoleLogin" && $.additionalEventData.MFAUsed = "No" }',
       metricTransformations=[
           {
               'metricName': 'ConsoleSignInWithoutMFA',
               'metricNamespace': 'YourNamespace',
               'metricValue': '1'
           },
       ]
   )
   ```
   Replace `'log_group_name'` with the name of your CloudTrail log group, and `'YourNamespace'` with a namespace for your metric.

4. **Check the Metric Data:**
   Now, you can check the metric data to detect if there has been a console sign-in without MFA. Here's how you can do it:
   ```python
   response = cloudwatch.get_metric_statistics(
       Namespace='YourNamespace',
       MetricName='ConsoleSignInWithoutMFA',
       StartTime=datetime.datetime.utcnow() - datetime.timedelta(seconds=600),
       EndTime=datetime.datetime.utcnow(),
       Period=60,
       Statistics=[
           'SampleCount',
       ]
   )
   ```
   This will return the number of console sign-ins without MFA in the last 10 minutes. If the 'SampleCount' is greater than 0, it means there has been a console sign-in without MFA.

```
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    for record in event['Records']:
        if record['eventName'] == 'ConsoleLogin':
            event_data = json.loads(record['CloudTrailEvent'])
            user_identity = event_data['userIdentity']
            if 'sessionContext' in user_identity and 'attributes' in user_identity['sessionContext']:
                attributes = user_identity['sessionContext']['attributes']
                if 'mfaAuthenticated' in attributes and attributes['mfaAuthenticated'] == 'false':
                    print('User signed in without MFA: {}'.format(user_identity['userName']))
```

4. Set up an alert to notify you when a user signs in without MFA.

   - Use Amazon SNS to send an email or text message when a sign-in event without MFA is detected.
   - Create a new SNS topic and subscribe to it.
   - Modify the Lambda function code to publish a message to the SNS topic when a sign-in event without MFA is detected.

```
import boto3
import json

sns = boto3.client('sns')
topic_arn = 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:signin-alerts'

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    for record in event['Records']:
        if record['eventName'] == 'ConsoleLogin':
            event_data = json.loads(record['CloudTrailEvent'])
            user_identity = event_data['userIdentity']
            if 'sessionContext' in user_identity and 'attributes' in user_identity['sessionContext']:
                attributes = user_identity['sessionContext']['attributes']
                if 'mfaAuthenticated' in attributes and attributes['mfaAuthenticated'] == 'false':
                    message = 'User signed in without MFA: {}'.format(user_identity['userName'])
                    sns.publish(TopicArn=topic_arn, Message=message)
```

5. Test the Lambda function.

   - Use the "Test" button in the Lambda function console to test the function.
   - Verify that you receive an email or text message when a sign-in event without MFA is detected.
