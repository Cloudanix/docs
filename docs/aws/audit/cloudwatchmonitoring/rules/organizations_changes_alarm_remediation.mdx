1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.

2. In the navigation pane, click on "Alarms".

3. In the "Alarms" dashboard, you can see all the alarms that have been set up. Look for the AWS Organizations Changes Alarm. If it's in the "OK" state, it means there are no misconfigurations. If it's in the "ALARM" state, it means the changes in AWS Organizations have triggered the alarm.

4. To get more details about the misconfiguration, click on the alarm name. In the details pane below, you can see the metrics and conditions that triggered the alarm.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "describe-alarms" command to list the alarms in your AWS account. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names "my alarm name"
   ```

   Replace "my alarm name" with the name of your alarm. This command will return a JSON object with the details of the specified alarm.

3. If you want to check the state of the alarm, you can use the "describe-alarm-state" command. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarm-state --alarm-names "my alarm name"
   ```

   This command will return the state of the specified alarm. The state can be "OK", "ALARM", or "INSUFFICIENT_DATA".

4. If you want to check the history of the alarm, you can use the "describe-alarm-history" command. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarm-history --alarm-name "my alarm name"
   ```

   This command will return the history of the specified alarm. The history includes the timestamps of each state change, the reason for the state change, and the updated configuration of the alarm.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Install AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):** To interact with AWS services, you need to install Boto3. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:** Before you can begin using Boto3, you need to set up authentication credentials for your AWS account using the AWS CLI. Credentials for your AWS account can be found in the IAM Console. You can create or use an existing user. Configure your AWS credentials as shown below:
   ```
   aws configure
   AWS Access Key ID [None]: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   Default region name [None]: YOUR_REGION_NAME
   Default output format [None]: json
   ```

3. **Create a Python Script to Check AWS Organizations Changes Alarm in Cloud Watch:** You can use the `describe_alarms` method in the CloudWatch client to retrieve information about your alarms. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_organizations_changes_alarm():
       # Create a CloudWatch client
       cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

       # List alarms of insufficient data through the pagination interface
       paginator = cloudwatch.get_paginator('describe_alarms')

       for response in paginator.paginate(StateValue='INSUFFICIENT_DATA'):
           print(response['MetricAlarms'])

   check_organizations_changes_alarm()
   ```
   This script will print out all the alarms that are in an INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. You can modify the `StateValue` parameter to 'OK' or 'ALARM' to check for alarms in those states.

4. **Run the Python Script:** Finally, run the python script using a python interpreter. If there are any AWS Organizations Changes Alarms, they will be printed out in the console. If not, no output will be shown.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
The AWS Organizations Changes Alarm is triggered when there is a change in the AWS Organizations structure, such as adding or removing accounts, or changing the root email address. To remediate this misconfiguration, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the CloudWatch service.

3. Click on "Alarms" in the left-hand menu.

4. Find the "AWS Organizations Changes Alarm" in the list of alarms.

5. Click on the alarm to view its details.

6. Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Disable Alarm Actions".

7. Click "Save" to disable the alarm.

This will stop the alarm from being triggered when there is a change in the AWS Organizations structure. However, it is important to regularly review and update your AWS Organizations structure to ensure that it is properly configured and secure.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The AWS Organizations Changes Alarm is triggered when there are changes made to the AWS Organizations service. To remediate this issue, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Log in to your AWS account using AWS CLI.

2. Run the following command to create an SNS topic that will be used to send notifications when the alarm is triggered:

```
aws sns create-topic --name <topic-name>
```

3. Run the following command to create a new CloudWatch alarm:

```
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name <alarm-name> --alarm-description "AWS Organizations Changes Alarm" --metric-name Organizations --namespace AWS/Organizations --statistic Sum --period 300 --evaluation-periods 1 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --dimensions Name=Operation,Value=All --alarm-actions <sns-topic-arn>
```

Replace the `<alarm-name>` with a name of your choice, `<sns-topic-arn>` with the ARN of the SNS topic created in step 2.

4. Verify that the alarm has been created successfully by running the following command:

```
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names <alarm-name>
```

This should return the details of the alarm that you just created.

5. Finally, you can test the alarm by making a change to your AWS Organizations service. If the alarm is triggered, you should receive a notification via the SNS topic created in step 2.

By following these steps, you can remediate the AWS Organizations Changes Alarm issue using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
The AWS Organizations Changes Alarm is triggered when there are changes made to the AWS Organizations service. To remediate this issue using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an SNS topic: You can create an SNS topic using the AWS SDK for Python (boto3). This topic will be used to send notifications whenever there is a change in the AWS Organizations service.

```python
import boto3

sns = boto3.client('sns')

response = sns.create_topic(Name='organizations-changes')

topic_arn = response['TopicArn']
```

2. Create a CloudWatch Events rule: You can create a CloudWatch Events rule to monitor changes to the AWS Organizations service. This rule will trigger an AWS Lambda function whenever there is a change.

```python
import boto3

events = boto3.client('events')

response = events.put_rule(
    Name='organizations-changes',
    EventPattern='{"source": ["aws.organizations"]}'
)

rule_arn = response['RuleArn']
```

3. Create an AWS Lambda function: You can create an AWS Lambda function using the AWS SDK for Python (boto3). This function will be triggered by the CloudWatch Events rule and will send a notification to the SNS topic.

```python
import boto3

lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')

response = lambda_client.create_function(
    FunctionName='organizations-changes',
    Runtime='python3.7',
    Role='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/lambda-role',
    Handler='lambda_function.lambda_handler',
    Code={
        'ZipFile': b'bytes',
    },
    Environment={
        'Variables': {
            'SNS_TOPIC_ARN': topic_arn,
        }
    },
)

function_arn = response['FunctionArn']
```

4. Add permissions to the Lambda function: You need to add permissions to the Lambda function to allow it to publish messages to the SNS topic.

```python
import boto3

lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')

response = lambda_client.add_permission(
    FunctionName='organizations-changes',
    StatementId='sns-publish',
    Action='lambda:InvokeFunction',
    Principal='sns.amazonaws.com',
    SourceArn=topic_arn,
)
```

5. Create a CloudWatch alarm: You can create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the SNS topic. This alarm will be triggered whenever a message is published to the SNS topic.

```python
import boto3

cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

response = cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
    AlarmName='organizations-changes',
    AlarmActions=[topic_arn],
    MetricName='NumberOfMessagesPublished',
    Namespace='AWS/SNS',
    Statistic='Sum',
    Period=60,
    EvaluationPeriods=1,
    Threshold=1,
    ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold',
)
```

These steps will help you remediate the AWS Organizations Changes Alarm issue using Python.
