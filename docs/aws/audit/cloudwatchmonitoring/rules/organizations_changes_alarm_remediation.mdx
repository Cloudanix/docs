1. **Create a CloudTrail Trail:**
   - Navigate to the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the **CloudTrail** service.
   - Click on **Create trail**.
   - Provide a name for the trail and configure it to log management events.
   - Ensure that the trail is enabled for all regions.
   - Save the trail.

2. **Create a CloudWatch Log Group:**
   - In the AWS Management Console, go to the **CloudWatch** service.
   - Click on **Logs** in the left-hand menu.
   - Click on **Create log group**.
   - Provide a name for the log group and create it.

3. **Configure CloudTrail to Send Logs to CloudWatch:**
   - Go back to the **CloudTrail** service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Select the trail you created.
   - In the **Trail settings**, enable **CloudWatch Logs**.
   - Choose the log group you created earlier.
   - Provide an IAM role that has the necessary permissions to publish logs to CloudWatch.

4. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm:**
   - In the AWS Management Console, go to the **CloudWatch** service.
   - Click on **Alarms** in the left-hand menu.
   - Click on **Create alarm**.
   - Select **Select metric** and choose the log group you created.
   - Configure the metric to filter for specific AWS Organizations API calls (e.g., `CreateAccount`, `DeleteAccount`, `InviteAccountToOrganization`, etc.).
   - Set the conditions for the alarm (e.g., whenever the metric is greater than 0).
   - Configure the alarm actions, such as sending a notification to an SNS topic or an email.
   - Review and create the alarm.

By following these steps, you will have set up a CloudWatch alarm to monitor changes in AWS Organizations, ensuring that any changes trigger an alert for further investigation.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent AWS Organizations changes from going unnoticed, you can set up an alarm in CloudWatch using the AWS CLI. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Create a CloudWatch Log Group:**
   First, create a CloudWatch Log Group where the AWS Organizations logs will be stored.
   ```sh
   aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name /aws/organizations
   ```

2. **Create a Metric Filter:**
   Create a metric filter to capture specific events related to AWS Organizations changes.
   ```sh
   aws logs put-metric-filter --log-group-name /aws/organizations \
   --filter-name OrganizationsChangesFilter \
   --filter-pattern '{ ($.eventSource = "organizations.amazonaws.com") && ($.eventName = "CreateOrganization" || $.eventName = "DeleteOrganization" || $.eventName = "UpdateOrganization") }' \
   --metric-transformations metricName=OrganizationsChanges,metricNamespace=AWS/Organizations,metricValue=1
   ```

3. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm:**
   Create an alarm based on the metric filter to notify you when there are changes in AWS Organizations.
   ```sh
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name OrganizationsChangesAlarm \
   --metric-name OrganizationsChanges \
   --namespace AWS/Organizations \
   --statistic Sum \
   --period 300 \
   --threshold 1 \
   --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold \
   --evaluation-periods 1 \
   --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:YourSNSTopic
   ```

4. **Subscribe to the SNS Topic:**
   Ensure you have an SNS topic and subscribe to it to receive notifications.
   ```sh
   aws sns subscribe --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:YourSNSTopic \
   --protocol email \
   --notification-endpoint your-email@example.com
   ```

By following these steps, you will set up a CloudWatch alarm to monitor and notify you of any changes in AWS Organizations using the AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent AWS Organizations changes and set up an alarm in CloudWatch using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up AWS SDK (Boto3)
First, ensure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### 2. Create a CloudWatch Client
Create a CloudWatch client using Boto3 in your Python script:

```python
import boto3

cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
```

### 3. Define the Metric Filter
Define a metric filter to capture AWS Organizations changes. This involves creating a filter pattern that matches the specific events related to AWS Organizations changes.

```python
log_group_name = 'your-log-group-name'
filter_name = 'OrganizationsChangesFilter'
filter_pattern = '{ ($.eventSource = "organizations.amazonaws.com") && ($.eventName = "CreateOrganization" || $.eventName = "DeleteOrganization" || $.eventName = "InviteAccountToOrganization" || $.eventName = "LeaveOrganization" || $.eventName = "RemoveAccountFromOrganization") }'
metric_namespace = 'YourNamespace'
metric_name = 'OrganizationsChanges'

logs = boto3.client('logs')

logs.put_metric_filter(
    logGroupName=log_group_name,
    filterName=filter_name,
    filterPattern=filter_pattern,
    metricTransformations=[
        {
            'metricName': metric_name,
            'metricNamespace': metric_namespace,
            'metricValue': '1'
        }
    ]
)
```

### 4. Create a CloudWatch Alarm
Create a CloudWatch alarm based on the metric filter you defined. This alarm will notify you when there are changes in AWS Organizations.

```python
alarm_name = 'OrganizationsChangesAlarm'
alarm_description = 'Alarm for AWS Organizations changes'
sns_topic_arn = 'arn:aws:sns:your-region:your-account-id:your-sns-topic'

cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
    AlarmName=alarm_name,
    AlarmDescription=alarm_description,
    ActionsEnabled=True,
    AlarmActions=[sns_topic_arn],
    MetricName=metric_name,
    Namespace=metric_namespace,
    Statistic='Sum',
    Period=300,
    EvaluationPeriods=1,
    Threshold=1,
    ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold'
)
```

### Summary
1. **Set Up AWS SDK (Boto3)**: Install and import Boto3.
2. **Create a CloudWatch Client**: Initialize the CloudWatch client.
3. **Define the Metric Filter**: Create a metric filter to capture AWS Organizations changes.
4. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm**: Set up an alarm to notify you of any changes.

By following these steps, you can effectively monitor and prevent unauthorized changes to AWS Organizations using Python scripts.

4. To get more details about the misconfiguration, click on the alarm name. In the details pane below, you can see the metrics and conditions that triggered the alarm.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "describe-alarms" command to list the alarms in your AWS account. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names "my alarm name"
   ```

   Replace "my alarm name" with the name of your alarm. This command will return a JSON object with the details of the specified alarm.

3. If you want to check the state of the alarm, you can use the "describe-alarm-state" command. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarm-state --alarm-names "my alarm name"
   ```

   This command will return the state of the specified alarm. The state can be "OK", "ALARM", or "INSUFFICIENT_DATA".

4. If you want to check the history of the alarm, you can use the "describe-alarm-history" command. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarm-history --alarm-name "my alarm name"
   ```

   This command will return the history of the specified alarm. The history includes the timestamps of each state change, the reason for the state change, and the updated configuration of the alarm.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Install AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):** To interact with AWS services, you need to install Boto3. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:** Before you can begin using Boto3, you need to set up authentication credentials for your AWS account using the AWS CLI. Credentials for your AWS account can be found in the IAM Console. You can create or use an existing user. Configure your AWS credentials as shown below:
   ```
   aws configure
   AWS Access Key ID [None]: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   Default region name [None]: YOUR_REGION_NAME
   Default output format [None]: json
   ```

3. **Create a Python Script to Check AWS Organizations Changes Alarm in Cloud Watch:** You can use the `describe_alarms` method in the CloudWatch client to retrieve information about your alarms. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_organizations_changes_alarm():
       # Create a CloudWatch client
       cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

       # List alarms of insufficient data through the pagination interface
       paginator = cloudwatch.get_paginator('describe_alarms')

       for response in paginator.paginate(StateValue='INSUFFICIENT_DATA'):
           print(response['MetricAlarms'])

   check_organizations_changes_alarm()
   ```
   This script will print out all the alarms that are in an INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. You can modify the `StateValue` parameter to 'OK' or 'ALARM' to check for alarms in those states.

4. **Run the Python Script:** Finally, run the python script using a python interpreter. If there are any AWS Organizations Changes Alarms, they will be printed out in the console. If not, no output will be shown.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The AWS Organizations Changes Alarm is triggered when there are changes made to the AWS Organizations service. To remediate this issue, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Log in to your AWS account using AWS CLI.

2. Run the following command to create an SNS topic that will be used to send notifications when the alarm is triggered:

```
aws sns create-topic --name <topic-name>
```

3. Run the following command to create a new CloudWatch alarm:

```
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name <alarm-name> --alarm-description "AWS Organizations Changes Alarm" --metric-name Organizations --namespace AWS/Organizations --statistic Sum --period 300 --evaluation-periods 1 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --dimensions Name=Operation,Value=All --alarm-actions <sns-topic-arn>
```

Replace the `<alarm-name>` with a name of your choice, `<sns-topic-arn>` with the ARN of the SNS topic created in step 2.

4. Verify that the alarm has been created successfully by running the following command:

```
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names <alarm-name>
```

This should return the details of the alarm that you just created.

5. Finally, you can test the alarm by making a change to your AWS Organizations service. If the alarm is triggered, you should receive a notification via the SNS topic created in step 2.

By following these steps, you can remediate the AWS Organizations Changes Alarm issue using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
The AWS Organizations Changes Alarm is triggered when there are changes made to the AWS Organizations service. To remediate this issue using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an SNS topic: You can create an SNS topic using the AWS SDK for Python (boto3). This topic will be used to send notifications whenever there is a change in the AWS Organizations service.

```python
import boto3

sns = boto3.client('sns')

response = sns.create_topic(Name='organizations-changes')

topic_arn = response['TopicArn']
```

2. Create a CloudWatch Events rule: You can create a CloudWatch Events rule to monitor changes to the AWS Organizations service. This rule will trigger an AWS Lambda function whenever there is a change.

```python
import boto3

events = boto3.client('events')

response = events.put_rule(
    Name='organizations-changes',
    EventPattern='{"source": ["aws.organizations"]}'
)

rule_arn = response['RuleArn']
```

3. Create an AWS Lambda function: You can create an AWS Lambda function using the AWS SDK for Python (boto3). This function will be triggered by the CloudWatch Events rule and will send a notification to the SNS topic.

```python
import boto3

lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')

response = lambda_client.create_function(
    FunctionName='organizations-changes',
    Runtime='python3.7',
    Role='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/lambda-role',
    Handler='lambda_function.lambda_handler',
    Code={
        'ZipFile': b'bytes',
    },
    Environment={
        'Variables': {
            'SNS_TOPIC_ARN': topic_arn,
        }
    },
)

function_arn = response['FunctionArn']
```

4. Add permissions to the Lambda function: You need to add permissions to the Lambda function to allow it to publish messages to the SNS topic.

```python
import boto3

lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')

response = lambda_client.add_permission(
    FunctionName='organizations-changes',
    StatementId='sns-publish',
    Action='lambda:InvokeFunction',
    Principal='sns.amazonaws.com',
    SourceArn=topic_arn,
)
```

5. Create a CloudWatch alarm: You can create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the SNS topic. This alarm will be triggered whenever a message is published to the SNS topic.

```python
import boto3

cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

response = cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
    AlarmName='organizations-changes',
    AlarmActions=[topic_arn],
    MetricName='NumberOfMessagesPublished',
    Namespace='AWS/SNS',
    Statistic='Sum',
    Period=60,
    EvaluationPeriods=1,
    Threshold=1,
    ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold',
)
```

These steps will help you remediate the AWS Organizations Changes Alarm issue using Python.
