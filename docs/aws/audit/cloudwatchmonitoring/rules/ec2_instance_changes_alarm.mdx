### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudWatch service. 

2. In the CloudWatch dashboard, click on "Alarms" in the left-hand navigation pane. This will display a list of all the alarms that have been configured.

3. Look for the EC2 Instance Changes Alarm in the list. If the alarm is in the "ALARM" state, it means that the changes in the EC2 instance have triggered the alarm. If the alarm is in the "INSUFFICIENT_DATA" state, it means that the alarm has been configured but there is not enough data to determine whether the alarm condition has been met. If the alarm is in the "OK" state, it means that the EC2 instance is functioning as expected.

4. Click on the name of the EC2 Instance Changes Alarm to view more details about the alarm. This will show you the metrics and conditions that are being monitored, the actions that will be taken when the alarm state changes, and the alarm history. The alarm history can be particularly useful for identifying when and why the alarm state changed.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can install AWS CLI using pip (Python package manager) by running the command `pip install awscli`. After installation, you can configure it by running `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List existing CloudWatch alarms: You can use the `describe-alarms` command to list all the existing CloudWatch alarms. The command is as follows:
   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the alarms along with their details.

3. Filter EC2 Instance Changes Alarm: If you want to check a specific alarm related to EC2 instance changes, you can filter the results using the `--alarm-names` option followed by the name of the alarm. For example:
   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names "EC2 Instance Changes"
   ```
   This command will return the details of the alarm named "EC2 Instance Changes".

4. Check the state of the alarm: The state of the alarm can be found in the `StateValue` field in the output of the above command. If the state is "ALARM", it means the alarm condition is met. If the state is "INSUFFICIENT_DATA", it means the alarm has started but the metrics are not available or not enough data is available to determine the alarm state. If the state is "OK", it means the metrics are within the defined threshold.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Use the CloudWatch client from boto3 to list all the alarms:

```python
cloudwatch = session.client('cloudwatch')

def list_alarms():
    alarms = cloudwatch.describe_alarms()
    for alarm in alarms['MetricAlarms']:
        print('Name: {}, State: {}'.format(alarm['AlarmName'], alarm['StateValue']))
```

4. Call the function to list all the alarms:

```python
list_alarms()
```

This script will print the name and state of all the alarms in your AWS account. If the state of the EC2 Instance Changes Alarm is not 'OK', it means there is a misconfiguration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

When an EC2 instance changes alarm is triggered, it means that there has been a change in the state of an EC2 instance. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a change in the instance type, security group, or IAM role. Here are the steps to remediate this issue in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudWatch service.
2. Click on "Alarms" in the left-hand menu and select the alarm that has been triggered.
3. Click on the "Actions" dropdown and select "Disable Alarm" to stop receiving notifications while you work on remediation.
4. Navigate to the EC2 service and select the instance that has triggered the alarm.
5. Review the instance details to determine what has changed and what needs to be remediated. This could include changes to the instance type, security group, or IAM role.
6. Make the necessary changes to remediate the issue. For example, if the instance type has changed, you may need to stop the instance and modify the instance type in the EC2 console.
7. Once the remediation is complete, navigate back to the CloudWatch service and select the alarm that was triggered.
8. Click on the "Actions" dropdown and select "Enable Alarm" to resume notifications.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the EC2 instance changes alarm in AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

The "EC2 Instance Changes" alarm is triggered when there is a change in the state of an EC2 instance, such as stopping or terminating the instance. To remediate this issue, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine and run the following command to describe the alarm:

```
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names "EC2 Instance Changes"
```

2. Identify the instance ID(s) that are causing the alarm.

3. Stop or terminate the instance(s) using the following command:

```
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```

or

```
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```

4. Once the instance(s) have been stopped or terminated, run the following command to delete the alarm:

```
aws cloudwatch delete-alarms --alarm-names "EC2 Instance Changes"
```

Note: It is recommended to create a new alarm to monitor the state of the EC2 instances to avoid similar issues in the future.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "EC2 Instance Changes Alarm" misconfiguration in AWS using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create a boto3 client for CloudWatch:

```python
cw_client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
```

3. List the existing alarms:

```python
existing_alarms = cw_client.describe_alarms()
```

4. Find the alarm that is triggering the "EC2 Instance Changes" alarm:

```python
for alarm in existing_alarms['MetricAlarms']:
    if alarm['AlarmName'] == 'EC2 Instance Changes':
        ec2_alarm = alarm
        break
```

5. Modify the alarm to disable it:

```python
ec2_alarm['ActionsEnabled'] = False
cw_client.put_metric_alarm(AlarmName='EC2 Instance Changes', MetricName='StatusCheckFailed', ActionsEnabled=False)
```

6. Verify that the alarm is disabled:

```python
existing_alarms = cw_client.describe_alarms()
for alarm in existing_alarms['MetricAlarms']:
    if alarm['AlarmName'] == 'EC2 Instance Changes':
        print(alarm['ActionsEnabled'])
```

The output should be `False`, indicating that the alarm is disabled.

Note: This solution assumes that you have the necessary permissions to modify CloudWatch alarms in your AWS account.
