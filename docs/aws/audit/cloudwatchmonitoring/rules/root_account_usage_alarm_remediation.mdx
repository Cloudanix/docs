<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent Root Account Usage Alarm in CloudWatch using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create an IAM User for Administrative Tasks:**
   - First, create an IAM user with administrative privileges to avoid using the root account for daily tasks.
   ```sh
   aws iam create-user --user-name AdminUser
   aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name AdminUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess
   ```

2. **Enable CloudTrail to Log API Calls:**
   - Ensure CloudTrail is enabled to log all API calls, including those made by the root account.
   ```sh
   aws cloudtrail create-trail --name MyTrail --s3-bucket-name my-trail-bucket
   aws cloudtrail start-logging --name MyTrail
   ```

3. **Create a CloudWatch Log Group:**
   - Create a CloudWatch log group to store the CloudTrail logs.
   ```sh
   aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name CloudTrail/DefaultLogGroup
   ```

4. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm for Root Account Usage:**
   - Create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor root account usage and send notifications.
   ```sh
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name RootAccountUsageAlarm \
   --metric-name RootAccountUsage --namespace AWS/CloudTrailMetrics \
   --statistic Sum --period 300 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold \
   --evaluation-periods 1 --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MySNSTopic
   ```

By following these steps, you can set up monitoring and alarms to prevent the usage of the root account in AWS.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent Root Account Usage Alarm in AWS CloudWatch using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python:**
   Ensure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create a CloudWatch Client:**
   Initialize a CloudWatch client using Boto3 in your Python script.
   ```python
   import boto3

   cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
   ```

3. **Define the Alarm:**
   Specify the parameters for the CloudWatch alarm that will monitor root account usage. This includes setting the metric, threshold, and actions to take when the alarm state changes.
   ```python
   alarm_name = 'RootAccountUsageAlarm'
   metric_name = 'RootAccountUsage'
   namespace = 'AWS/CloudTrail'
   statistic = 'Sum'
   period = 300  # 5 minutes
   evaluation_periods = 1
   threshold = 1
   comparison_operator = 'GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold'
   alarm_actions = ['arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:your-sns-topic']  # Replace with your SNS topic ARN
   ```

4. **Create the Alarm:**
   Use the `put_metric_alarm` method to create the alarm in CloudWatch.
   ```python
   response = cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
       AlarmName=alarm_name,
       MetricName=metric_name,
       Namespace=namespace,
       Statistic=statistic,
       Period=period,
       EvaluationPeriods=evaluation_periods,
       Threshold=threshold,
       ComparisonOperator=comparison_operator,
       AlarmActions=alarm_actions,
       AlarmDescription='Alarm when root account is used',
       ActionsEnabled=True
   )

   print("Alarm created successfully:", response)
   ```

Here is the complete Python script:

```python
import boto3

# Initialize CloudWatch client
cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

# Define alarm parameters
alarm_name = 'RootAccountUsageAlarm'
metric_name = 'RootAccountUsage'
namespace = 'AWS/CloudTrail'
statistic = 'Sum'
period = 300  # 5 minutes
evaluation_periods = 1
threshold = 1
comparison_operator = 'GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold'
alarm_actions = ['arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:your-sns-topic']  # Replace with your SNS topic ARN

# Create the alarm
response = cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
    AlarmName=alarm_name,
    MetricName=metric_name,
    Namespace=namespace,
    Statistic=statistic,
    Period=period,
    EvaluationPeriods=evaluation_periods,
    Threshold=threshold,
    ComparisonOperator=comparison_operator,
    AlarmActions=alarm_actions,
    AlarmDescription='Alarm when root account is used',
    ActionsEnabled=True
)

print("Alarm created successfully:", response)
```

This script will create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers when the root account is used, helping you to monitor and prevent unauthorized root account usage.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.

2. In the navigation pane, click on "Alarms".

3. In the "Alarms" dashboard, look for an alarm named "RootAccountUsage". This alarm is triggered when the root account is used for AWS Management Console sign-in, AWS API operations, or AWS CLI commands.

4. If the alarm is in the "ALARM" state, it means that the root account has been used recently. If it's in the "INSUFFICIENT_DATA" state, it means that the alarm has not been triggered yet, which is a good sign. If the alarm is in the "OK" state, it means that the root account has not been used recently.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all CloudWatch alarms: Use the following command to list all the CloudWatch alarms in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms
   ```

   This command will return a JSON object that contains information about all the alarms in your account.

3. Filter for Root Account Usage Alarm: You can filter the output of the previous command to check if there is an alarm for Root Account Usage. You can do this by using the `grep` command in Unix-based systems or the `findstr` command in Windows. The command would look something like this:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms | grep "RootAccountUsage"
   ```

   If this command returns any output, it means that there is an alarm for Root Account Usage.

4. Check the state of the alarm: If there is an alarm for Root Account Usage, you can check its state by using the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarm-state --alarm-name "RootAccountUsage"
   ```

   This command will return the state of the alarm. If the state is "ALARM", it means that the root account has been used recently. If the state is "OK", it means that the root account has not been used recently. If the state is "INSUFFICIENT_DATA", it means that there is not enough data to determine whether the root account has been used recently.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Use the CloudWatch client from boto3 to list all the alarms:

```python
cloudwatch = session.client('cloudwatch')

def list_alarms():
    response = cloudwatch.describe_alarms()
    return response['MetricAlarms']
```

4. Check for the Root Account Usage Alarm in the list of alarms:

```python
def check_root_account_usage_alarm():
    alarms = list_alarms()
    for alarm in alarms:
        if alarm['AlarmName'] == 'RootAccountUsage':
            return True
    return False
```

This script will return True if the Root Account Usage Alarm is set up and False if it is not. Please replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', and 'YOUR_REGION' with your actual AWS credentials and region.

   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to CloudWatch.
   - Identify the alarms related to "RootAccountUsageCount" and "RootAccountUsageEventCount" metrics under the "CloudTrailMetrics" namespace.
   - Modify or create new alarms as necessary to ensure that alarms are triggered appropriately for root account usage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
- Use the AWS CLI `cloudwatch put-metric-alarm` command to create or modify alarms for the specified metrics and namespace.
   - You can use the following CLI commands as a reference:
     ```bash
     aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name RootAccountUsageCountAlarm --alarm-description "Alarm for Root Account Usage Count" --metric-name RootAccountUsageCount --namespace CloudTrailMetrics --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --threshold 1 --evaluation-periods 1 --statistic Sum --period 300 --actions-enabled --alarm-actions <SNS topic ARN>
     
     aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name RootAccountUsageEventCountAlarm --alarm-description "Alarm for Root Account Usage Event Count" --metric-name RootAccountUsageEventCount --namespace CloudTrailMetrics --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --threshold 1 --evaluation-periods 1 --statistic Sum --period 300 --actions-enabled --alarm-actions <SNS topic ARN>
     ```
   - Replace `<SNS topic ARN>` with the ARN of the SNS topic where you want to receive alarm notifications.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
- You can use the Boto3 library in Python to interact with AWS services.
   - Below is a sample Python script to create or modify alarms for the specified metrics and namespace:
     ```python
     import boto3

     def create_cloudwatch_alarm(metric_name, namespace, alarm_name, alarm_description, threshold, sns_topic_arn):
         cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
         cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
             AlarmName=alarm_name,
             AlarmDescription=alarm_description,
             MetricName=metric_name,
             Namespace=namespace,
             ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold',
             Threshold=threshold,
             EvaluationPeriods=1,
             Statistic='Sum',
             Period=300,
             ActionsEnabled=True,
             AlarmActions=[sns_topic_arn]
         )

     sns_topic_arn = '<SNS topic ARN>'
     create_cloudwatch_alarm('RootAccountUsageCount', 'CloudTrailMetrics', 'RootAccountUsageCountAlarm', 'Alarm for Root Account Usage Count', 1, sns_topic_arn)
     create_cloudwatch_alarm('RootAccountUsageEventCount', 'CloudTrailMetrics', 'RootAccountUsageEventCountAlarm', 'Alarm for Root Account Usage Event Count', 1, sns_topic_arn)
     ```
   - Replace `<SNS topic ARN>` with the ARN of the SNS topic where you want to receive alarm notifications.
