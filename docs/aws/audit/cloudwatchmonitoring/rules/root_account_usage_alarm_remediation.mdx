How to create CloudWatch alarm and configure it in AWS account to fire each time Root Account is used?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudWatch service.
2. Click on "Metrics" in the navigation panel on the left side.
3. Click on the "Create metric" button.
4. In the "Create metric" wizard, select the "Custom Namespaces" option.
5. Click on the "Create metric" button.
6. Provide a name for the custom metric, such as "RootAccountUsageEventCount".
7. Select the appropriate unit for the metric, such as "Count" or "None".
8. Under the "Add Dimension" section, click on the "Configure" button.
9. In the "Configure dimensions" dialog, provide a name for the dimension, such as "AccountName".
10. Enter the value for the dimension, which could be the name or ID of your AWS root account.
11. Click on the "Add dimension" button to add the dimension.
12. Click on the "Create metric" button to create the custom metric.
13. After creating the custom metric, you can now start publishing data points to it using the AWS SDK or CLI. You need to capture the root account usage events in your application code or scripts and publish the count of events to the custom metric periodically.
14. Once data points are published, you can view and monitor the "RootAccountUsageEventCount" metric in CloudWatch, create alarms based on this metric, and perform other operations available for CloudWatch metrics.
