How to create CloudWatch alarm and configure it in your AWS account to fire each time a VPC environment configuration change is made?

#### Using AWS Console

##### Create SNS topic and the necessary subscription to send email notifications whenever the appropriate Amazon CloudWatch alarm is triggered.

- Step 1: In the navigation panel, select Topics and click the Create new topic button.

- Step 2: In the Create new topic dialog box, enter a name and a display name for your topic then click Create Topic.

- Step 3: Open the newly created SNS topic configuration page by clicking on its Amazon Resource Name (ARN):
- Step 4: Under Subscription section click Create Subscription.

- Step 5: Select Email as subscription protocol from the Protocol dropdown list.

- Step 6: In the Endpoint box, enter the email address where you want to receive the CloudWatch alarm notifications then click Create Subscription to create the required subscription.

- Step 7: Use your preferred email client application to open the message received from AWS Notifications, then click on the appropriate link to confirm your new subscription.

##### Create the necessary metric filter and the CloudWatch alarm that will fire and send email notifications whenever an AWS VPC environment configuration will change.

- Step 1: In the left navigation panel, select Logs.

- Step 2: Select the log group created for your CloudTrail trail event logs and click Create Metric Filter button.

- Step 3: On the Define Logs Metric Filter page, paste the following pattern inside the Filter Pattern box:
  { ($.eventName = CreateVpc) ||
					  ($.eventName = DeleteVpc) ||
  ($.eventName = ModifyVpcAttribute) ||
					  ($.eventName = AcceptVpcPeeringConnection) ||
  ($.eventName = CreateVpcPeeringConnection) || 
					  ($.eventName = DeleteVpcPeeringConnection) ||
  ($.eventName = RejectVpcPeeringConnection) || 
					  ($.eventName = AttachClassicLinkVpc) ||
  ($.eventName = DetachClassicLinkVpc) || 
					  ($.eventName = DisableVpcClassicLink) ||
  ($.eventName = EnableVpcClassicLink) }.
  This pattern will be used for scanning the AWS CloudTrail logs for event names like “CreateVpc”, “ModifyVpcAttribute” or “DeleteVpc”.

- Step 4: Review the metric filter config details then click Assign Metric.
