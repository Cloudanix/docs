1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.

2. In the navigation pane, click on "Alarms". 

3. In the "Alarms" section, you can see all the alarms that have been set up. Look for the alarm that is set up to monitor Security Group changes. It could be named something like "SecurityGroupChangesAlarm".

4. Click on the name of the alarm to view its details. In the "History" tab, you can see the state changes of the alarm. If the state is "ALARM", it means that the alarm condition is met. You can also see the reason for the state change. If there are any changes in the security group, it will be recorded here.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access CloudWatch.

2. Once AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can use the following command to list all the alarms in CloudWatch:

```bash
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms
```

This command will return a list of all the alarms that are currently configured in CloudWatch. 

3. To check for a specific alarm related to Security Group changes, you can filter the results using the `--alarm-names` option followed by the name of the alarm. For example:

```bash
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names "SecurityGroupChanges"
```

This command will return the details of the alarm named "SecurityGroupChanges". 

4. If you want to check the state of this alarm, you can use the `--state-value` option followed by the state you want to check. For example, to check if the alarm is in the "ALARM" state, you can use the following command:

```bash
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --state-value ALARM --alarm-names "SecurityGroupChanges"
```

This command will return the details of the alarm named "SecurityGroupChanges" if it is currently in the "ALARM" state. If the alarm is not in the "ALARM" state, the command will not return any results.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. You can install it using pip:
```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and initialize the client for CloudWatch. You will need your AWS access key and secret access key, which you can get from the AWS Management Console.
```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client(
    'cloudwatch',
    region_name='us-west-2',
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
)
```

3. Use the `describe_alarms` function to get information about all the alarms in your AWS account. This function returns a dictionary that contains information about each alarm, including its name, state, and the actions that are taken when the alarm changes state.
```python
alarms = client.describe_alarms()
for alarm in alarms['MetricAlarms']:
    print('Name: ' + alarm['AlarmName'])
    print('State: ' + alarm['StateValue'])
    print('Actions: ' + str(alarm['AlarmActions']))
```

4. To specifically check for Security Group Changes Alarm, you can filter the alarms based on the alarm name or any other specific attribute related to the Security Group Changes Alarm.
```python
for alarm in alarms['MetricAlarms']:
    if 'Security Group Changes' in alarm['AlarmName']:
        print('Name: ' + alarm['AlarmName'])
        print('State: ' + alarm['StateValue'])
        print('Actions: ' + str(alarm['AlarmActions']))
```
This script will print the name, state, and actions of the Security Group Changes Alarm if it exists.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the Security Group Changes Alarm misconfiguration in AWS using AWS console:

Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the Security Group Changes Alarm misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Sign in to your AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the CloudWatch dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.

3. In the left navigation panel, select **Logs**.

4. Select the log group created for your CloudTrail trail event logs and click the **Create Metric Filter** button.

5. On the Define Logs Metric Filter page, paste the following pattern inside the Filter Pattern box:

```
{
    ($.eventName = AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress) || ($.eventName = AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress) ||
    ($.eventName = RevokeSecurityGroupIngress) || ($.eventName = RevokeSecurityGroupEgress) ||
    ($.eventName = CreateSecurityGroup) || ($.eventName = DeleteSecurityGroup)
}
```

This pattern will be used for scanning the AWS CloudTrail logs for event names like "CreateSecurityGroup", "AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress", or "DeleteSecurityGroup".

6. Review the metric filter configuration details, then click **Assign Metric**.

7. On the Create Metric Filter and Assign a Metric page, perform the following:

   - In the **Filter Name** box, enter a unique name for the new filter (e.g., `SecurityGroupConfigChanges`).
   - In the **Metric Namespace** box, type `CloudTrailMetrics`.
   - In the **Metric Name** box, type `SecurityGroupEventCount` for the metric identifier.
   - Click **Show advanced metric settings** to slide down the advanced settings section.
   - In the **Metric Value** box, enter `1`.

8. Review the details, then click **Create Filter** to generate your new CloudWatch Logs metric filter.

9. On the current page, click **Create Alarm**.

10. In the Create Alarm dialog box, provide the following information:
    - Within the **Alarm Threshold** section, in the **Name** and **Description** fields, enter a unique name and a short description for the new CloudWatch alarm.
    - Under **Whenever: Metric Name**, select `>=` (greater than or equal to) from the dropdown list and enter `1` as the threshold value in the box next to the dropdown list to trigger the alarm every time a configuration change involving an AWS security group is made.
    - In the **Actions** section, click the **+ Notification** button, select **State is ALARM** from the dropdown menu, and choose the AWS SNS topic name created previously from the **Send notification to** section.
    - In the **Alarm Preview** section, select `5 Minutes` from the **Period** dropdown list and `Sum` from the **Statistic** list.
    - Review the CloudWatch alarm configuration details, then click **Create Alarm**. Once created, the new alarm will be listed on the Alarms page.

It is important to note that setting up the alarm does not fix the underlying issue. You need to identify and remediate the root cause of the misconfiguration to ensure that your infrastructure remains secure.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the Security Group Changes Alarm using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command to create the necessary CloudWatch metric filter and associate it with the appropriate CloudTrail log group:

```bash
aws logs put-metric-filter \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --log-group-name CloudTrail/CloudWatchLogGroup \
    --filter-name SecurityGroupConfigChanges \
    --filter-pattern '{ ($.eventName = AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress) || ($.eventName = AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress) || ($.eventName = RevokeSecurityGroupIngress) || ($.eventName = RevokeSecurityGroupEgress) || ($.eventName = CreateSecurityGroup) || ($.eventName = DeleteSecurityGroup) }' \
    --metric-transformations metricName=SecurityGroupEventCount,metricNamespace=CloudTrailMetrics,metricValue=1
```

2. Run the following command to create the AWS CloudWatch alarm that will fire whenever a configuration change involving an AWS security group within your account is made:

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --alarm-name SecurityGroupConfigChangesAlarm \
    --alarm-description "Triggered by AWS security group(s) config changes." \
    --metric-name SecurityGroupEventCount \
    --namespace CloudTrailMetrics \
    --statistic Sum \
    --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold \
    --evaluation-periods 1 \
    --period 300 \
    --threshold 1 \
    --actions-enabled \
    --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:CloudWatchAlarmSNSTopic
```

After creating the alarm, ensure to investigate the cause of the security group changes and take any necessary steps to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
