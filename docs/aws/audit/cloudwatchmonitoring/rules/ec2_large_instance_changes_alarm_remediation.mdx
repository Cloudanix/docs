<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm in CloudWatch using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm for EC2 Instance Size Changes:**
   - Use the `put-metric-alarm` command to create an alarm that triggers when there is a change in the instance type of your EC2 instances.
   ```sh
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name "EC2InstanceTypeChangeAlarm" \
   --metric-name "InstanceType" --namespace "AWS/EC2" --statistic "SampleCount" \
   --period 300 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold" \
   --evaluation-periods 1 --alarm-actions "arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:topic-name" \
   --dimensions "Name=InstanceId,Value=i-1234567890abcdef0"
   ```

2. **Enable Detailed Monitoring for EC2 Instances:**
   - Ensure that detailed monitoring is enabled for your EC2 instances to get more granular metrics.
   ```sh
   aws ec2 monitor-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0
   ```

3. **Set Up SNS Topic for Alarm Notifications:**
   - Create an SNS topic to receive notifications when the alarm is triggered.
   ```sh
   aws sns create-topic --name EC2InstanceTypeChangeTopic
   ```

4. **Subscribe to the SNS Topic:**
   - Subscribe an email endpoint to the SNS topic to receive notifications.
   ```sh
   aws sns subscribe --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:EC2InstanceTypeChangeTopic \
   --protocol email --notification-endpoint your-email@example.com
   ```

By following these steps, you can set up a CloudWatch alarm to monitor and prevent unauthorized or unintended changes to the instance type of your EC2 instances using AWS CLI.

To prevent EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm in CloudWatch using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   - Ensure you have Boto3 installed. If not, install it using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install boto3
     ```

2. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm:**
   - Use Boto3 to create a CloudWatch alarm that monitors EC2 instance type changes. This script will set up an alarm to notify you if an instance type change occurs.

3. **Define the Python Script:**
   - Below is a Python script to create a CloudWatch alarm for monitoring EC2 instance type changes:

     ```python
     import boto3

     # Initialize a session using Amazon EC2
     session = boto3.Session(
         aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
         aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
         region_name='YOUR_REGION'
     )

     # Initialize CloudWatch client
     cloudwatch = session.client('cloudwatch')

     # Create CloudWatch alarm
     response = cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
         AlarmName='EC2_Instance_Type_Change_Alarm',
         AlarmDescription='Alarm when there is a change in EC2 instance type',
         ActionsEnabled=True,
         AlarmActions=[
             'arn:aws:sns:YOUR_REGION:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:YOUR_SNS_TOPIC'
         ],
         MetricName='InstanceType',
         Namespace='AWS/EC2',
         Statistic='SampleCount',
         Dimensions=[
             {
                 'Name': 'InstanceId',
                 'Value': 'YOUR_INSTANCE_ID'
             },
         ],
         Period=300,
         EvaluationPeriods=1,
         Threshold=1,
         ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold'
     )

     print("Alarm created successfully!")
     ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script to create the CloudWatch alarm. Ensure you replace placeholders like `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY`, `YOUR_SECRET_KEY`, `YOUR_REGION`, `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID`, `YOUR_SNS_TOPIC`, and `YOUR_INSTANCE_ID` with your actual AWS credentials, region, SNS topic ARN, and instance ID.

By following these steps, you can set up a CloudWatch alarm to monitor and prevent unauthorized or unintended changes to your EC2 instance types using a Python script.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the following commands:

   Installation:
   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Configuration:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. List all CloudWatch alarms: You can list all the CloudWatch alarms in your AWS account by running the following command:
   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the alarms along with their details.

3. Filter EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm: If you know the name of the alarm, you can filter it out from the list of alarms by using the `--alarm-names` option followed by the name of the alarm. For example:
   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names "EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm"
   ```
   This command will return the details of the specified alarm.

4. Check the state of the alarm: The state of the alarm can be found in the `StateValue` field in the output of the previous command. If the state is `ALARM`, it means that the alarm condition is met. If the state is `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, it means that the alarm has started but the metrics are not available or not enough data is available to determine the alarm state. If the state is `OK`, it means that the metrics are within the defined threshold.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To detect EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm in Cloud Watch using python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Boto3:**
   Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:**
   Before you can begin using Boto3, you should set up authentication credentials. You can do this by creating a new IAM user in your AWS account and then configure boto3 to use these credentials. You can set your credentials for use by Boto3 in several ways, but here is a simple way:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   Then input your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

3. **Create a Python Script:**
   You can use the Boto3 library to interact with AWS services. Here's a simple script to list all the CloudWatch alarms:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_alarms():
       client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
       response = client.describe_alarms()
       return response['MetricAlarms']

   def main():
       alarms = list_alarms()
       for alarm in alarms:
           print(f"Alarm Name: {alarm['AlarmName']}, State: {alarm['StateValue']}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```
   This script will print the name and state of all the alarms in your AWS account.

4. **Check for EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm:**
   You can modify the script to specifically check for EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm. You can do this by checking the `AlarmName` or `MetricName` in the response:
   ```python
   def main():
       alarms = list_alarms()
       for alarm in alarms:
           if 'EC2 Large Instance Changes' in alarm['AlarmName']:
               print(f"Alarm Name: {alarm['AlarmName']}, State: {alarm['StateValue']}")
   ```
   This script will print the name and state of the EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm if it exists.

2. Run the following command to describe the CloudWatch alarm that has been triggered due to the EC2 instance size change:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-name <alarm-name>
   ```

   Replace `<alarm-name>` with the name of the alarm that has been triggered.

3. Identify the EC2 instance that has been resized and note down its instance ID.

4. Run the following command to get the current instance type of the resized EC2 instance:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id> --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceType" --output text
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the resized EC2 instance.

5. Determine the instance type that the EC2 instance should be running on based on your application requirements.

6. Run the following command to modify the instance type of the resized EC2 instance:

   ```
   aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --instance-type <instance-type>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the resized EC2 instance and `<instance-type>` with the instance type that the EC2 instance should be running on.

7. Verify that the instance type of the resized EC2 instance has been updated by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id> --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceType" --output text
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the resized EC2 instance.

8. Confirm that the CloudWatch alarm has been resolved by checking the CloudWatch console or running the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-name <alarm-name>
   ```

   Replace `<alarm-name>` with the name of the alarm that has been triggered. The alarm should show a status of "OK" once the EC2 instance size has been corrected.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the "EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm" misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
The EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm is triggered when the size of an EC2 instance is increased or decreased. To remediate this issue, you can use the following steps:

Step 1: Create a Lambda function in AWS console

- Go to the AWS console and select the Lambda service.
- Click on the "Create function" button.
- Choose "Author from scratch" and give your function a name.
- Select "Python 3.8" as the runtime.
- Choose an existing or create a new execution role with the necessary permissions.
- Click on "Create function".

Step 2: Add code to the Lambda function

- In the "Function code" section, paste the following code:

```python
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    instance_id = event['detail']['instance-id']
    instance_type = event['detail']['instance-type']
    ec2.modify_instance_attribute(InstanceId=instance_id, Attribute='instanceType', Value=instance_type)
```

This code will modify the instance type of the instance that triggered the alarm to its original type.

Step 3: Add a CloudWatch Events rule

- Go to the AWS console and select the CloudWatch service.
- Click on "Rules" in the left-hand menu and then click on "Create rule".
- Choose "Event pattern" as the rule type.
- In the "Event pattern" section, select "EC2 Instance State-change Notification" as the Event source.
- In the "Specific state(s)" section, select "running" and "stopped".
- Click on "Add target" and select "Lambda function".
- Choose the Lambda function you created in Step 1.
- Click on "Configure details".
- Give your rule a name and description.
- Click on "Create rule".

This CloudWatch Events rule will trigger your Lambda function whenever an EC2 instance changes state to "running" or "stopped".

Step 4: Test the solution

- Go to the AWS console and select the EC2 service.
- Launch a new instance and wait for it to start running.
- Stop the instance and wait for it to stop.
- Check the CloudWatch Logs for your Lambda function to verify that it was triggered and successfully modified the instance type.

This solution will remediate the EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm by automatically changing the instance type back to its original type.
