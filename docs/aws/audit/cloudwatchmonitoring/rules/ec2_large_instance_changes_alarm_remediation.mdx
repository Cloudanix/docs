### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudWatch service. 

2. In the CloudWatch dashboard, click on "Alarms" in the left-hand navigation pane. 

3. In the Alarms dashboard, you can see a list of all the alarms that have been configured. Look for the EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm. 

4. Click on the alarm name to view its details. Here, you can check the alarm configuration, its state (whether it's in ALARM, OK, or INSUFFICIENT_DATA state), and its history (which shows when the alarm state changed and why).

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can install AWS CLI using pip (Python package manager) by running the command `pip install awscli`. After installation, you can configure it by running `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all CloudWatch alarms: You can use the `describe-alarms` command to list all the alarms in your AWS account. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the alarms along with their details.

3. Filter EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm: If you have a large number of alarms and you want to find a specific alarm, you can filter the results using the `--alarm-names` option followed by the name of the alarm. For example, if the name of your alarm is "EC2 Large Instance Changes", you can find it using the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names "EC2 Large Instance Changes"
   ```

4. Check the state of the alarm: The state of the alarm (whether it is OK, ALARM, or INSUFFICIENT_DATA) is included in the details returned by the `describe-alarms` command. You can check the "StateValue" field in the output to see the state of the "EC2 Large Instance Changes" alarm.

#### Using Python

To detect EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm in Cloud Watch using python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Boto3:**
   Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:**
   Before you can begin using Boto3, you should set up authentication credentials. You can do this by using the AWS CLI and running the `aws configure` command. This will prompt you for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, AWS Region, and output format.

3. **Python Script to Check EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm:**
   Here is a simple python script using Boto3 to check EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm in Cloud Watch:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_ec2_large_instance_changes_alarm():
       client = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
       response = client.describe_alarms(
           AlarmNames=[
               'EC2 Large Instance Changes',
           ]
       )
       alarms = response['MetricAlarms']
       for alarm in alarms:
           print('Alarm Name:', alarm['AlarmName'])
           print('Alarm Description:', alarm['AlarmDescription'])
           print('Alarm State:', alarm['StateValue'])

   check_ec2_large_instance_changes_alarm()
   ```
   This script will print the name, description, and state of the alarm named 'EC2 Large Instance Changes'. If the alarm does not exist or is not configured correctly, it will not be listed in the output.

4. **Run the Python Script:**
   Save the script in a file, for example, `check_alarm.py`, and then run it using Python:
   ```
   python check_alarm.py
   ```
   The output will give you the details of the 'EC2 Large Instance Changes' alarm. If there are any misconfigurations, you can identify them by analyzing the output.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the "EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm" misconfiguration in AWS using the AWS console:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudWatch service.

2. In the CloudWatch dashboard, click on the "Alarms" option from the left-hand menu.

3. Find the alarm for "EC2 Large Instance Changes" and click on it.

4. In the alarm details page, click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Edit."

5. In the "Edit Alarm" page, you can adjust the alarm threshold to your desired value. For example, if you want to receive an alarm when the instance size is larger than an m4.xlarge, you can set the threshold to ">= m4.xlarge."

6. After setting the threshold, click on the "Update Alarm" button to save your changes.

7. Verify that the alarm threshold has been updated by checking the "Current State" column in the alarm list. If the state is "OK," the alarm has been successfully remediated.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the "EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm" misconfiguration for AWS using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the "EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm" misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to describe the CloudWatch alarm that has been triggered due to the EC2 instance size change:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-name <alarm-name>
   ```

   Replace `<alarm-name>` with the name of the alarm that has been triggered.

3. Identify the EC2 instance that has been resized and note down its instance ID.

4. Run the following command to get the current instance type of the resized EC2 instance:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id> --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceType" --output text
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the resized EC2 instance.

5. Determine the instance type that the EC2 instance should be running on based on your application requirements.

6. Run the following command to modify the instance type of the resized EC2 instance:

   ```
   aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <instance-id> --instance-type <instance-type>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the resized EC2 instance and `<instance-type>` with the instance type that the EC2 instance should be running on.

7. Verify that the instance type of the resized EC2 instance has been updated by running the following command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id> --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceType" --output text
   ```

   Replace `<instance-id>` with the ID of the resized EC2 instance.

8. Confirm that the CloudWatch alarm has been resolved by checking the CloudWatch console or running the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-name <alarm-name>
   ```

   Replace `<alarm-name>` with the name of the alarm that has been triggered. The alarm should show a status of "OK" once the EC2 instance size has been corrected.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the "EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm" misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

The EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm is triggered when the size of an EC2 instance is increased or decreased. To remediate this issue, you can use the following steps:

Step 1: Create a Lambda function in AWS console

- Go to the AWS console and select the Lambda service.
- Click on the "Create function" button.
- Choose "Author from scratch" and give your function a name.
- Select "Python 3.8" as the runtime.
- Choose an existing or create a new execution role with the necessary permissions.
- Click on "Create function".

Step 2: Add code to the Lambda function

- In the "Function code" section, paste the following code:

```python
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    instance_id = event['detail']['instance-id']
    instance_type = event['detail']['instance-type']
    ec2.modify_instance_attribute(InstanceId=instance_id, Attribute='instanceType', Value=instance_type)
```

This code will modify the instance type of the instance that triggered the alarm to its original type.

Step 3: Add a CloudWatch Events rule

- Go to the AWS console and select the CloudWatch service.
- Click on "Rules" in the left-hand menu and then click on "Create rule".
- Choose "Event pattern" as the rule type.
- In the "Event pattern" section, select "EC2 Instance State-change Notification" as the Event source.
- In the "Specific state(s)" section, select "running" and "stopped".
- Click on "Add target" and select "Lambda function".
- Choose the Lambda function you created in Step 1.
- Click on "Configure details".
- Give your rule a name and description.
- Click on "Create rule".

This CloudWatch Events rule will trigger your Lambda function whenever an EC2 instance changes state to "running" or "stopped".

Step 4: Test the solution

- Go to the AWS console and select the EC2 service.
- Launch a new instance and wait for it to start running.
- Stop the instance and wait for it to stop.
- Check the CloudWatch Logs for your Lambda function to verify that it was triggered and successfully modified the instance type.

This solution will remediate the EC2 Large Instance Changes Alarm by automatically changing the instance type back to its original type.
