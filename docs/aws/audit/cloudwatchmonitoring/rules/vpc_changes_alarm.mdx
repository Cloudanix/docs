1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.

2. In the navigation pane, click on "Alarms".

3. In the "Alarms" dashboard, you can see all the alarms that have been set up. Look for the VPC Changes Alarm. If it's in the "ALARM" state, it means that the specific changes or events that the alarm was set up to monitor have occurred.

4. For more details about the alarm, click on the alarm name. This will open the "Alarm details" page where you can see the metric name, the threshold that triggers the alarm, the state of the alarm, and other relevant information.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all CloudWatch alarms: You can use the `describe-alarms` command to list all the alarms in your AWS account. The command is as follows:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the alarms in your AWS account, including their names, states, and other information.

3. Filter for VPC Changes Alarm: If you have a lot of alarms and you want to find a specific one, you can filter the results using the `--alarm-names` option followed by the name of the alarm. For example, if the name of your VPC Changes Alarm is "VPCChangesAlarm", you can find it with the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names "VPCChangesAlarm"
   ```

4. Check the state of the VPC Changes Alarm: The state of the alarm is included in the output of the `describe-alarms` command. Look for the "StateValue" field in the output. If the state is "ALARM", it means that the alarm has been triggered. If the state is "OK", it means that no alarm conditions have been met. If the state is "INSUFFICIENT_DATA", it means that there isn't enough data to determine whether the alarm conditions have been met.

1. **Install Boto3**: Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
2. **Configure AWS Credentials**: Before you can begin using Boto3, you should set up authentication credentials. You can do this by using the AWS CLI and configuring it with your access key and secret key.
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   It will prompt you for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format. Fill these details accordingly.

3. **Python Script to Check VPC Changes Alarm in CloudWatch**: Below is a simple Python script using Boto3 to check if a VPC Changes Alarm exists in CloudWatch.

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_vpc_changes_alarm():
       cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
       alarms = cloudwatch.describe_alarms()
       for alarm in alarms['MetricAlarms']:
           if alarm['AlarmName'] == 'VPC Changes Alarm':
               return True
       return False

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       if check_vpc_changes_alarm():
           print("VPC Changes Alarm exists in CloudWatch")
       else:
           print("VPC Changes Alarm does not exist in CloudWatch")
   ```
   This script first creates a CloudWatch client using Boto3. It then retrieves all the alarms in CloudWatch using the `describe_alarms` method. It iterates over each alarm and checks if the alarm name is 'VPC Changes Alarm'. If it finds such an alarm, it returns True, else it returns False.

4. **Run the Python Script**: You can run the Python script using any Python environment. If the script prints "VPC Changes Alarm exists in CloudWatch", then the VPC Changes Alarm is correctly configured. If it prints "VPC Changes Alarm does not exist in CloudWatch", then there is a misconfiguration, and the VPC Changes Alarm does not exist in CloudWatch.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
The VPC Changes Alarm is triggered when changes are made to the VPC configuration. To remediate this issue and set up the alarm, follow the steps below:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the CloudWatch dashboard at [CloudWatch Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

3. In the left navigation panel, select **Logs**.

4. Select the log group created for your CloudTrail trail event logs and click **Create Metric Filter**.

5. On the **Define Logs Metric Filter** page, paste the following filter pattern inside the **Filter Pattern** box:

```
{
    ($.eventName = CreateVpc) || ($.eventName = DeleteVpc) || ($.eventName = ModifyVpcAttribute) ||
    ($.eventName = AcceptVpcPeeringConnection) || ($.eventName = CreateVpcPeeringConnection) ||
    ($.eventName = DeleteVpcPeeringConnection) || ($.eventName = RejectVpcPeeringConnection) ||
    ($.eventName = AttachClassicLinkVpc) || ($.eventName = DetachClassicLinkVpc) || ($.eventName = DisableVpcClassicLink) ||
    ($.eventName = EnableVpcClassicLink)
}
```

6. Review the metric filter configuration and click **Assign Metric**.

7. On the **Create Metric Filter and Assign a Metric** page, perform the following:

   - In the **Filter Name** box, enter a unique name for the new filter, e.g., `VPCNetworkConfigChanges`.
   - In the **Metric Namespace** box, type `CloudTrailMetrics`.
   - In the **Metric Name** box, type `VpcEventCount`.
   - In the **Metric Value** box, enter `1`.

8. Review the details and click **Create Filter**.

9. On the current page, click **Create Alarm**.

10. In the **Create Alarm** dialog box, provide the following:

- **Name and Description**: Enter a unique name and a short description for the CloudWatch alarm.
- **Alarm Threshold**: Set the threshold to trigger the alarm every time a configuration change involving an AWS VPC is made.
- **Actions**: Add notifications using an existing SNS topic.
- **Alarm Preview**: Set the period to `5 minutes` and choose `Sum` for the statistic.

11. Review the details and click **Create Alarm**. Once created, the new alarm will be listed on the Alarms page.
