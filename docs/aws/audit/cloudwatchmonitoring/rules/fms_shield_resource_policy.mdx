   # Put the resource policy
   response = cloudwatch_client.put_resource_policy(
       PolicyName='FMSShieldResourcePolicy',
       PolicyDocument=resource_policy_json
   )

   print("Resource Policy Enabled:", response)
   ```

4. **Verify the Policy:**
   - Optionally, you can verify if the policy has been applied correctly by retrieving the resource policies.
   ```python
   # Retrieve the resource policies
   response = cloudwatch_client.describe_resource_policies()

   # Print the policies to verify
   for policy in response['ResourcePolicies']:
       print("Policy Name:", policy['PolicyName'])
       print("Policy Document:", policy['PolicyDocument'])
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that the FMS Shield Resource Policy is enabled in CloudWatch using Python scripts. This will help in preventing the misconfiguration and ensuring that the necessary policies are in place.

<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Firewall Manager service.

2. In the Firewall Manager dashboard, click on "AWS Shield Advanced" on the left-hand side menu.

3. In the AWS Shield Advanced page, click on "Resource policies". 

4. Here, you can see all the resource policies. Check if the FMS Shield Resource Policy is enabled or not. If it's not enabled, it indicates a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local system. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all policies: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the policies in your AWS account.

   ```
   aws fms list-policies --region your-region-name
   ```

   Replace 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region. This command will return a list of all FMS policies in your account.

3. Check for Shield Resource Policy: Look for a policy with the name "AWSManagedRulesShieldAdvancedProtectorsRuleSet". This is the AWS Shield Resource policy. If this policy is not present in the list, it means that the FMS Shield Resource Policy is not enabled.

4. Check policy status: If the policy is present, you can check its status using the following command:

   ```
   aws fms get-policy --policy-id your-policy-id --region your-region-name
   ```

   Replace 'your-policy-id' with the ID of the Shield Resource policy and 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region. This command will return the details of the policy, including its status. If the status is 'ENABLED', it means that the FMS Shield Resource Policy is enabled. If the status is 'DISABLED', it means that the policy is not enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if FMS Shield Resource Policy is enabled in CloudWatch using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Setup AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script to List All Policies:**
   You can use the `list_policies` method of the FMS client in Boto3 to list all FMS policies. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_policies():
       client = boto3.client('fms')
       response = client.list_policies()
       return response['PolicySummaryList']

   policies = list_policies()
   for policy in policies:
       print(policy)
   ```

3. **Check if FMS Shield Resource Policy is Enabled:**
   The `list_policies` method returns a list of policy summaries. You can check if the FMS Shield Resource Policy is enabled by checking the `PolicyType` and `RemediationEnabled` fields of each policy summary. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def is_shield_resource_policy_enabled():
       client = boto3.client('fms')
       response = client.list_policies()
       for policy in response['PolicySummaryList']:
           if policy['PolicyType'] == 'AWS_SHIELD_ADVANCED' and policy['RemediationEnabled']:
               return True
       return False

   print(is_shield_resource_policy_enabled())
   ```

4. **Handle Exceptions:**
   You should also handle any exceptions that might occur when calling the `list_policies` method. For example, you might get a `NoCredentialsError` if your AWS credentials are not properly configured. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3
   from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError

   def is_shield_resource_policy_enabled():
       try:
           client = boto3.client('fms')
           response = client.list_policies()
           for policy in response['PolicySummaryList']:
               if policy['PolicyType'] == 'AWS_SHIELD_ADVANCED' and policy['RemediationEnabled']:
                   return True
       except NoCredentialsError:
           print("AWS credentials not configured properly.")
       return False

   print(is_shield_resource_policy_enabled())
   ```

This script will print `True` if the FMS Shield Resource Policy is enabled and `False` otherwise. It will also print an error message if your AWS credentials are not configured properly.
