### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Lambda console.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Functions".

3. Select the name of the function that you want to check.

4. In the "Configuration" tab, scroll down to the "Concurrency" section. If there is no concurrency limit set, it means the Lambda function does not have concurrency configured.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Lambda functions.

2. Once the AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can list all the Lambda functions in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws lambda list-functions --region your-region-name
   ```

   Replace 'your-region-name' with the name of the region where your Lambda functions are deployed. This command will return a JSON object with details about all your Lambda functions.

3. To check the concurrency configuration of a specific Lambda function, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws lambda get-function --function-name your-function-name --region your-region-name
   ```

   Replace 'your-function-name' with the name of the Lambda function you want to check and 'your-region-name' with the name of the region where the function is deployed. This command will return a JSON object with details about the specified Lambda function.

4. In the returned JSON object, look for the 'Concurrency' field. If this field is not present or if it's value is not set, then the Lambda function does not have a concurrency configuration. If the 'Concurrency' field is present and it's value is set, then the Lambda function has a concurrency configuration.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You will need `boto3` for AWS SDK for Python. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`. Alternatively, you can use the AWS CLI's `configure` command.

3. Write a Python script to list all Lambda functions and their concurrency configurations: Here is a simple script that does this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a low-level service client
   client = boto3.client('lambda')

   # List all functions
   response = client.list_functions()

   for function in response['Functions']:
       try:
           concurrency = client.get_function_concurrency(
               FunctionName=function['FunctionName']
           )
           print(f"Function: {function['FunctionName']}, Concurrency: {concurrency['ReservedConcurrentExecutions']}")
       except client.exceptions.ProvisionedConcurrencyConfigNotFoundException:
           print(f"Function: {function['FunctionName']}, Concurrency: Not configured")
   ```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using the Python interpreter. The script will print the name of each Lambda function and its concurrency configuration. If a function does not have a concurrency configuration, it will print "Not configured". This way, you can easily detect any misconfigurations.

   ```bash
   python check_lambda_concurrency.py
   ```

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of AWS Lambda not having Concurrency configured, follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to AWS Lambda**: Click on the "Services" dropdown at the top left corner of the console, then select "Lambda" under the "Compute" section.

3. **Select the Lambda Function**: From the list of Lambda functions, select the function that you want to configure Concurrency for by clicking on its name.

4. **Configure Concurrency**: In the function's configuration page, scroll down to the "Concurrency" section and click on the "Edit" button.

5. **Set Concurrency Limit**: In the Concurrency settings, you can set the maximum number of concurrent executions allowed for the Lambda function. Enter the desired value in the "Reserved concurrency" field. You can also set the "Unreserved concurrency" if needed.

6. **Save Changes**: After entering the concurrency limit, click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

7. **Verify Configuration**: Once saved, verify that the Concurrency configuration is correctly set by checking the Concurrency section on the Lambda function's configuration page.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of AWS Lambda not having Concurrency configured. This will help in controlling the maximum number of concurrent executions for the Lambda function.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of AWS Lambda not having concurrency configured, follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. List all the Lambda functions to identify which functions do not have concurrency configured:
```
aws lambda list-functions --query 'Functions[?Concurrency IS EMPTY].FunctionName'
```

2. For each Lambda function identified in the previous step, set the concurrency limit using the following command:
```
aws lambda put-function-concurrency --function-name <function-name> --reserved-concurrent-executions <concurrency-limit>
```
Replace `<function-name>` with the actual name of the Lambda function and `<concurrency-limit>` with the desired maximum number of concurrent executions allowed for the function.

3. Verify that the concurrency configuration has been successfully applied by describing the function and checking the concurrency settings:
```
aws lambda get-function --function-name <function-name> --query Concurrency
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of AWS Lambda functions not having concurrency configured using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of AWS Lambda not having concurrency configured, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Lambda service.

2. Select the Lambda function for which you want to configure concurrency.

3. In the function configuration page, scroll down to the "Concurrency" section.

4. Click on the "Edit" button next to the "Concurrency" section.

5. In the "Edit Concurrency" dialog box, you can set the maximum number of concurrent executions for the Lambda function. You can set a value between 1 and 1000.

6. Once you have set the desired concurrency limit, click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

7. You can also configure the reserved concurrency for the Lambda function if you want to ensure that a specific number of concurrent executions are always available for the function.

8. After configuring the concurrency settings, monitor the Lambda function to ensure that it is operating within the specified concurrency limits.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of AWS Lambda not having concurrency configured.
