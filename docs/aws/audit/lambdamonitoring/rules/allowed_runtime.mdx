1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Lambda service.
2. In the AWS Lambda dashboard, select the Functions from the left-hand side menu. This will display a list of all the Lambda functions that are currently deployed within the selected AWS region.
3. Select a function from the list to view its configuration details. Under the Configuration tab, look for the Runtime field. This field indicates the runtime version that the selected Lambda function is currently using.
4. Compare the runtime version with the latest available runtime versions listed in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. If the function's runtime version is not the latest, it indicates a misconfiguration. Repeat this process for all the Lambda functions deployed within your AWS environment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Lambda functions.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the Lambda functions in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws lambda list-functions --region your-region-name
   ```
   Replace 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region.

3. This command will return a JSON object with details about all your Lambda functions. To check the runtime version of each function, you can look at the 'Runtime' field in the returned JSON. 

4. To automate this process, you can use a Python script to parse the JSON and check if any functions are using an outdated runtime. Here's a simple example:

   ```python
   import json
   import subprocess

   def check_lambda_runtimes():
       result = subprocess.run(['aws', 'lambda', 'list-functions', '--region', 'your-region-name'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
       functions = json.loads(result.stdout)['Functions']
       for function in functions:
           if function['Runtime'] != 'python3.8':  # replace with the latest runtime version
               print(f"Function {function['FunctionName']} is using an outdated runtime: {function['Runtime']}")

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       check_lambda_runtimes()
   ```
   Replace 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region and 'python3.8' with the latest runtime version. This script will print the names of all functions that are using an outdated runtime.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3` in your terminal.

2. Once Boto3 is installed, you can use it to interact with AWS services. To check the runtime version of Lambda functions, you need to use the `get_function_configuration` method of the `lambda` client. Here is a sample script:

```python
import boto3

# Create a low-level service client
client = boto3.client('lambda')

# Get the list of all functions
response = client.list_functions()

# Iterate over each function
for function in response['Functions']:
    # Get the function configuration
    config = client.get_function_configuration(FunctionName=function['FunctionName'])
    # Print the function name and runtime
    print(f"Function: {function['FunctionName']}, Runtime: {config['Runtime']}")
```

3. This script will print the name and runtime of each Lambda function in your AWS account. To check if they are using the latest runtime version, you need to compare the `Runtime` value with the latest versions listed in the AWS documentation.

4. To automate this process, you can modify the script to include a list of the latest runtime versions and check if the `Runtime` value is in this list. If it's not, the script can print a warning message. Here is an example:

```python
import boto3

# Create a low-level service client
client = boto3.client('lambda')

# Get the list of all functions
response = client.list_functions()

# List of latest runtime versions
latest_runtimes = ['nodejs14.x', 'python3.9', 'java11', 'go1.16', 'dotnetcore3.1']

# Iterate over each function
for function in response['Functions']:
    # Get the function configuration
    config = client.get_function_configuration(FunctionName=function['FunctionName'])
    # Check if the runtime is the latest version
    if config['Runtime'] not in latest_runtimes:
        print(f"WARNING: Function {function['FunctionName']} is not using the latest runtime version. Current: {config['Runtime']}")
```

This script will print a warning for each function that is not using the latest runtime version.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Lambda service.
2. Select the Lambda function that you want to update.
3. Click on the "Configuration" tab.
4. Under the "General configuration" section, you will see the "Runtime" option. Click on the "Edit" button next to it.
5. Select the latest version of the runtime from the drop-down list.
6. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

After following these steps, your Lambda function will be updated with the latest runtime version. It is recommended to regularly check for updates and keep your Lambda functions up-to-date to ensure optimal performance and security.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Lambda Functions Should Have Latest Runtime Version" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Run the following command to list all the Lambda functions in your AWS account:
```
aws lambda list-functions
```

3. Identify the Lambda function that is not using the latest runtime version.

4. Run the following command to update the runtime version of the Lambda function:
```
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <function-name> --runtime <runtime-version>
```
Replace `<function-name>` with the name of your Lambda function and `<runtime-version>` with the latest runtime version available for your function's programming language.

5. Once the command is executed successfully, the runtime version of the Lambda function will be updated to the latest version. 

6. Verify the updated runtime version by running the following command:
```
aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name <function-name> | grep Runtime
```
Replace `<function-name>` with the name of your Lambda function.

7. Repeat the above steps for all the Lambda functions that are not using the latest runtime version.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Lambda Functions Should Have Latest Runtime Version" for AWS using AWS CLI.

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('lambda')

response = client.update_function_configuration(
    FunctionName='your-function-name',
    Runtime='python3.8'
)

print(response)
