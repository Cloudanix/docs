1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Lambda service by typing 'Lambda' into the search bar and selecting 'Lambda' from the dropdown menu.
3. Once in the Lambda service, you will see a list of all your Lambda functions. Click on the name of the function you want to check.
4. In the function overview page, under the 'Configuration' tab, you can see the runtime version of the Lambda function. If the runtime version is listed as a deprecated version, then the Lambda function is using a deprecated version.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Lambda functions.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the Lambda functions in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws lambda list-functions --region your-region-name
   ```
   Replace 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region.

3. This command will return a JSON object with details about all your Lambda functions. You can check the 'Runtime' field for each function to see which runtime version it's using.

4. To filter out the functions that are using deprecated versions, you can use the 'jq' command-line JSON processor. Here's an example command that filters out functions using the Node.js 0.10.42 runtime:

   ```
   aws lambda list-functions --region your-region-name | jq '.Functions[] | select(.Runtime=="nodejs0.10.42")'
   ```
   Replace 'nodejs0.10.42' with the deprecated runtime version you want to check for. If a function is using a deprecated version, this command will return its details. If no functions are using the deprecated version, the command will return nothing.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. This can be done using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and establish a session: In your Python script, you need to import the Boto3 library and establish a session with AWS. You also need to specify the region where your Lambda functions are located.

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       region_name="your_region"
   )
   ```

3. List all Lambda functions: Use the `list_functions` method to get a list of all Lambda functions in the specified region.

   ```python
   lambda_client = session.client('lambda')

   response = lambda_client.list_functions()
   ```

4. Check for deprecated runtime versions: For each function in the response, check the `Runtime` attribute. If it's a deprecated version, print out the function name.

   ```python
   deprecated_runtimes = ['nodejs', 'nodejs4.3', 'nodejs6.10', 'nodejs8.10', 'java8', 'dotnetcore2.0', 'dotnetcore2.1', 'go1.x', 'ruby2.5', 'provided']

   for function in response['Functions']:
       if function['Runtime'] in deprecated_runtimes:
           print(f"Deprecated runtime detected: {function['FunctionName']} uses {function['Runtime']}")
   ```

This script will print out the names of all Lambda functions that are using deprecated runtime versions. You can modify it to suit your needs, for example by adding more deprecated runtimes to the list, or by taking different actions when a deprecated runtime is detected.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of Lambda Functions using deprecated versions in AWS, follow these steps:

1. Login to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the AWS Lambda service.
3. Select the Lambda function that is using a deprecated version.
4. Click on the "Configuration" tab.
5. In the "Runtime settings" section, select the latest version of the runtime that is available. For example, if the function is using Node.js 8.10, select Node.js 14.x.
6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.
7. Test the function to ensure that it is working properly with the updated runtime version.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of Lambda Functions using deprecated versions in AWS.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the Lambda Functions Should Not Use Deprecated Versions misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and make sure you have the AWS CLI installed.

2. Run the following command to list all the Lambda functions in your AWS account:

```
aws lambda list-functions
```

3. Identify the Lambda functions that are using deprecated versions.

4. Run the following command to update the runtime of the Lambda function to a non-deprecated version:

```
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <function-name> --runtime <runtime>
```

Replace `<function-name>` with the name of the Lambda function that you want to update, and `<runtime>` with the non-deprecated runtime version that you want to use.

5. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for all the Lambda functions that are using deprecated versions.

6. Verify that all the Lambda functions are now using non-deprecated versions by running the following command:

```
aws lambda list-functions --query 'Functions[*].Runtime'
```

This command will return a list of all the Lambda functions and their respective runtimes. Make sure that all the runtimes are non-deprecated versions.

By following these steps, you can remediate the Lambda Functions Should Not Use Deprecated Versions misconfiguration in AWS using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Lambda Functions Should Not Use Deprecated Versions" in AWS using Python, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Lambda service.

2. Select the Lambda function that is using a deprecated version.

3. Click on the "Configuration" tab and scroll down to the "Runtime settings" section.

4. Verify the runtime version of the function. If it is using a deprecated version, then it needs to be updated.

5. Update the runtime version of the Lambda function to the latest version supported by AWS. You can refer to the AWS documentation to find the latest supported version.

6. Once the update is complete, click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

7. Test the updated Lambda function to ensure that it is functioning as expected.

8. Finally, it is recommended to regularly monitor the runtime versions of your Lambda functions and update them as needed to ensure that they are not using any deprecated versions.

In Python, you can use the AWS SDK boto3 to programmatically update the runtime version of your Lambda function. Here's an example code snippet:

```
import boto3

# Replace <function_name> and <new_runtime> with your function name and the new runtime version respectively
function_name = "<function_name>"
new_runtime = "<new_runtime>"

# Create a Lambda client object
lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')

# Update the runtime version of the function
response = lambda_client.update_function_configuration(
    FunctionName=function_name,
    Runtime=new_runtime
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```
