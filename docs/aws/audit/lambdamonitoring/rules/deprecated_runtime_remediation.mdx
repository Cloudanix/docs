<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To prevent Lambda functions from using deprecated versions in AWS using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Lambda Console:**
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - In the search bar, type "Lambda" and select the Lambda service from the list.

2. **Review Lambda Functions:**
   - In the Lambda console, you will see a list of your Lambda functions.
   - Click on each function to review its configuration.

3. **Check Runtime Version:**
   - Within the function's configuration page, locate the "Runtime" setting.
   - Ensure that the runtime version is not deprecated. AWS provides a list of supported and deprecated runtimes in their documentation.

4. **Update Deprecated Runtimes:**
   - If you find any Lambda function using a deprecated runtime, click the "Edit" button in the Runtime settings.
   - Select a supported runtime version from the dropdown menu and save the changes.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Lambda functions are not using deprecated versions, thereby maintaining compatibility and security.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent Lambda functions from using deprecated versions in AWS using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **List All Lambda Functions**:
   First, list all the Lambda functions in your AWS account to identify which ones are using deprecated runtime versions.
   ```sh
   aws lambda list-functions --query 'Functions[*].{FunctionName:FunctionName, Runtime:Runtime}'
   ```

2. **Check for Deprecated Runtimes**:
   Compare the runtime versions of your Lambda functions against the list of deprecated runtimes provided by AWS. You can find the list of deprecated runtimes in the AWS Lambda documentation.

3. **Update Lambda Function Runtime**:
   For each Lambda function using a deprecated runtime, update the runtime to a supported version. Replace `FUNCTION_NAME` and `NEW_RUNTIME` with the appropriate values.
   ```sh
   aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name FUNCTION_NAME --runtime NEW_RUNTIME
   ```

4. **Automate the Check and Update**:
   Create a script to automate the process of checking and updating Lambda functions. Here is a simple example in Bash:
   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash

   deprecated_runtimes=("nodejs10.x" "python2.7" "ruby2.5") # Add other deprecated runtimes as needed
   new_runtime="nodejs14.x" # Replace with the desired new runtime

   functions=$(aws lambda list-functions --query 'Functions[*].{FunctionName:FunctionName, Runtime:Runtime}' --output json)

   for function in $(echo "${functions}" | jq -c '.[]'); do
       function_name=$(echo "${function}" | jq -r '.FunctionName')
       runtime=$(echo "${function}" | jq -r '.Runtime')

       if [[ " ${deprecated_runtimes[@]} " =~ " ${runtime} " ]]; then
           echo "Updating function ${function_name} from runtime ${runtime} to ${new_runtime}"
           aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name "${function_name}" --runtime "${new_runtime}"
       fi
   done
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Lambda functions are not using deprecated runtime versions, thereby maintaining compatibility and security.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the use of deprecated versions in AWS Lambda functions using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **List All Lambda Functions**
First, you need to list all the Lambda functions in your AWS account. This can be done using the `boto3` library in Python.

```python
import boto3

def list_lambda_functions():
    client = boto3.client('lambda')
    response = client.list_functions()
    return response['Functions']

lambda_functions = list_lambda_functions()
for function in lambda_functions:
    print(function['FunctionName'])
```

### 2. **Check Runtime Versions**
Next, you need to check the runtime versions of these Lambda functions to ensure they are not using deprecated versions.

```python
def check_runtime_versions(lambda_functions):
    deprecated_runtimes = ['nodejs10.x', 'python2.7', 'dotnetcore2.1']  # Add other deprecated runtimes as needed
    for function in lambda_functions:
        if function['Runtime'] in deprecated_runtimes:
            print(f"Function {function['FunctionName']} is using a deprecated runtime: {function['Runtime']}")

check_runtime_versions(lambda_functions)
```

### 3. **Update Lambda Function Runtime**
If a Lambda function is using a deprecated runtime, you should update it to a supported version. This can be done using the `update_function_configuration` method.

```python
def update_lambda_runtime(function_name, new_runtime):
    client = boto3.client('lambda')
    response = client.update_function_configuration(
        FunctionName=function_name,
        Runtime=new_runtime
    )
    return response

# Example usage:
# update_lambda_runtime('my-lambda-function', 'python3.8')
```

### 4. **Automate the Update Process**
You can automate the process of updating all Lambda functions that are using deprecated runtimes.

```python
def automate_runtime_update(lambda_functions, new_runtime):
    deprecated_runtimes = ['nodejs10.x', 'python2.7', 'dotnetcore2.1']  # Add other deprecated runtimes as needed
    for function in lambda_functions:
        if function['Runtime'] in deprecated_runtimes:
            print(f"Updating {function['FunctionName']} from {function['Runtime']} to {new_runtime}")
            update_lambda_runtime(function['FunctionName'], new_runtime)

# Example usage:
# automate_runtime_update(lambda_functions, 'python3.8')
```

### Summary
1. **List all Lambda functions** using `boto3`.
2. **Check runtime versions** to identify deprecated ones.
3. **Update Lambda function runtime** to a supported version.
4. **Automate the update process** for all functions using deprecated runtimes.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your AWS Lambda functions are not using deprecated versions, thereby maintaining compliance and security.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Lambda service by typing 'Lambda' into the search bar and selecting 'Lambda' from the dropdown menu.
3. Once in the Lambda service, you will see a list of all your Lambda functions. Click on the name of the function you want to check.
4. In the function overview page, under the 'Configuration' tab, you can see the runtime version of the Lambda function. If the runtime version is listed as a deprecated version, then the Lambda function is using a deprecated version.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Lambda functions.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can list all the Lambda functions in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws lambda list-functions --region your-region-name
   ```
   Replace 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region.

3. This command will return a JSON object with details about all your Lambda functions. You can check the 'Runtime' field for each function to see which runtime version it's using.

4. To filter out the functions that are using deprecated versions, you can use the 'jq' command-line JSON processor. Here's an example command that filters out functions using the Node.js 0.10.42 runtime:

   ```
   aws lambda list-functions --region your-region-name | jq '.Functions[] | select(.Runtime=="nodejs0.10.42")'
   ```
   Replace 'nodejs0.10.42' with the deprecated runtime version you want to check for. If a function is using a deprecated version, this command will return its details. If no functions are using the deprecated version, the command will return nothing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. This can be done using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and establish a session: In your Python script, you need to import the Boto3 library and establish a session with AWS. You also need to specify the region where your Lambda functions are located.

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       region_name="your_region"
   )
   ```

3. List all Lambda functions: Use the `list_functions` method to get a list of all Lambda functions in the specified region.

   ```python
   lambda_client = session.client('lambda')

   response = lambda_client.list_functions()
   ```

4. Check for deprecated runtime versions: For each function in the response, check the `Runtime` attribute. If it's a deprecated version, print out the function name.

   ```python
   deprecated_runtimes = ['nodejs', 'nodejs4.3', 'nodejs6.10', 'nodejs8.10', 'java8', 'dotnetcore2.0', 'dotnetcore2.1', 'go1.x', 'ruby2.5', 'provided']

   for function in response['Functions']:
       if function['Runtime'] in deprecated_runtimes:
           print(f"Deprecated runtime detected: {function['FunctionName']} uses {function['Runtime']}")
   ```

This script will print out the names of all Lambda functions that are using deprecated runtime versions. You can modify it to suit your needs, for example by adding more deprecated runtimes to the list, or by taking different actions when a deprecated runtime is detected.
