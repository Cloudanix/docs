1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Lambda service. You can do this by typing "Lambda" into the search bar and selecting "Lambda" from the dropdown menu.
3. Once you're in the Lambda service, you'll see a list of all your functions. Click on a function to view its details.
4. In the function's details page, scroll down to the "Execution role" section. Here, you can see the IAM role that's associated with the function. Note down this IAM role.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the functions in your list. If you find that multiple functions are using the same IAM role, then you have detected a misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to list all the Lambda functions in your AWS account. You can do this by using the AWS CLI command `aws lambda list-functions`. This command will return a JSON object with all your Lambda functions.

    ```
    aws lambda list-functions --region your-region
    ```

2. Next, you need to extract the IAM role for each Lambda function. You can do this by parsing the JSON object returned by the previous command. Each function's details are stored in a dictionary, and the IAM role can be found under the 'Role' key.

    ```
    aws lambda list-functions --region your-region --query 'Functions[*].[FunctionName,Role]' --output text
    ```

3. Now, you need to check if multiple functions are using the same IAM role. You can do this by storing the IAM roles in a list and then checking if any role appears more than once in the list. This can be done using a Python script. Here is a simple script that does this:

    ```python
    import subprocess
    import collections

    command = "aws lambda list-functions --region your-region --query 'Functions[*].[FunctionName,Role]' --output text"
    output = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True).decode('utf-8').split('\n')

    roles = [line.split('\t')[1] for line in output if line]
    duplicates = [item for item, count in collections.Counter(roles).items() if count > 1]

    if duplicates:
        print(f"The following IAM roles are used by multiple Lambda functions: {', '.join(duplicates)}")
    else:
        print("No IAM roles are used by multiple Lambda functions.")
    ```

4. Run the Python script. If there are any IAM roles used by multiple Lambda functions, they will be printed out. If not, a message will be printed saying that no IAM roles are used by multiple Lambda functions.

1. Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS using Boto3. Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others.

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

2. Create a client for AWS Lambda and IAM. 

```python
lambda_client = session.client('lambda')
iam_client = session.client('iam')
```

3. Get a list of all the Lambda functions and their respective IAM roles. 

```python
functions = lambda_client.list_functions()['Functions']
role_dict = {}

for function in functions:
    role = function['Role']
    if role not in role_dict:
        role_dict[role] = [function['FunctionName']]
    else:
        role_dict[role].append(function['FunctionName'])
```

4. Check if any IAM role is associated with more than one Lambda function. If it is, print out the function names and the IAM role.

```python
for role, functions in role_dict.items():
    if len(functions) > 1:
        print(f"IAM Role {role} is associated with multiple Lambda functions: {', '.join(functions)}")
```

This script will help you identify any IAM roles that are associated with more than one Lambda function, which could be a potential misconfiguration.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure! Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "Multiple Functions Should Not Have The Same IAM Role" for AWS:

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Lambda service from the Services menu.
3. Select the function that has the same IAM role as another function.
4. Scroll down to the "Permissions" section and click on the IAM role name.
5. This will take you to the IAM console. Click on the "Create Role" button.
6. In the "Create Role" wizard, select "AWS service" as the trusted entity and "Lambda" as the service that will use this role.
7. Click on the "Next: Permissions" button.
8. In the "Attach permissions policies" section, select the policies that your function needs to run.
9. Click on the "Next: Tags" button.
10. Add any tags that you want to associate with this role (optional).
11. Click on the "Next: Review" button.
12. Give the role a name and description.
13. Click on the "Create Role" button.
14. Go back to the Lambda function and scroll down to the "Permissions" section.
15. Click on the "Edit" button next to the "Execution role" field.
16. Select the newly created IAM role from the list.
17. Click on the "Save" button.

That's it! You have now remediated the misconfiguration "Multiple Functions Should Not Have The Same IAM Role" for AWS. Repeat these steps for any other functions that have the same IAM role.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this misconfiguration in AWS, you can follow the below steps using AWS CLI:

1. Identify the functions that have the same IAM role assigned to them. You can use the following command to list all the functions and their IAM roles:

```
aws lambda list-functions --query 'Functions[*].[FunctionName, Role]'
```

2. Once you have identified the functions that have the same IAM role assigned to them, you can create a new IAM role for each function using the following command:

```
aws iam create-role --role-name <new_role_name> --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
```

Note: Replace `<new_role_name>` with a unique name for the new IAM role and `trust-policy.json` with the path to a JSON file containing the trust policy for the role.

3. After creating the new IAM roles, you can update the function configurations to use the new IAM roles using the following command:

```
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <function_name> --role <new_role_arn>
```

Note: Replace `<function_name>` with the name of the function that needs to be updated and `<new_role_arn>` with the ARN of the new IAM role created in step 2.

4. Repeat step 3 for all the functions that have the same IAM role assigned to them.

5. Once all the functions have been updated to use unique IAM roles, you can delete the old shared IAM role using the following command:

```
aws iam delete-role --role-name <old_role_name>
```

Note: Replace `<old_role_name>` with the name of the old shared IAM role that needs to be deleted.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of having multiple functions with the same IAM role in AWS.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Multiple Functions Should Not Have The Same IAM Role" in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the functions that are sharing the same IAM role. You can use the AWS CLI command `aws lambda list-functions` to get a list of all the functions in your account and their associated IAM roles.

2. For each function that is sharing the same IAM role with another function, create a new IAM role. You can use the AWS CLI command `aws iam create-role` to create a new IAM role with the necessary permissions for the function.

3. Update each function to use the new IAM role. You can use the AWS CLI command `aws lambda update-function-configuration` to update the function's configuration and specify the new IAM role.

Here's an example Python script that you can use to remediate this misconfiguration:

```
import boto3

# Initialize the AWS clients
lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

# Get a list of all the functions in the account
response = lambda_client.list_functions()

# Loop through each function
for function in response['Functions']:
    # Get the function's IAM role
    role_arn = function['Role']
    role_name = role_arn.split('/')[-1]

    # Check if the role is being used by multiple functions
    response = lambda_client.list_functions(
        FunctionVersion='ALL',
        MaxItems=10000
    )
    shared_role_functions = []
    for f in response['Functions']:
        if f['Role'] == role_arn and f['FunctionName'] != function['FunctionName']:
            shared_role_functions.append(f['FunctionName'])

    if shared_role_functions:
        # Create a new IAM role for the function
        new_role_name = f"{function['FunctionName']}-lambda-role"
        response = iam_client.create_role(
            RoleName=new_role_name,
            AssumeRolePolicyDocument='{"Version": "2012-10-17","Statement": [{"Effect": "Allow","Principal": {"Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"},"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"}]}'
        )

        # Attach the necessary policies to the new IAM role
        policy_arns = ['arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole']
        for policy_arn in policy_arns:
            iam_client.attach_role_policy(
                RoleName=new_role_name,
                PolicyArn=policy_arn
            )

        # Update the function to use the new IAM role
        lambda_client.update_function_configuration(
            FunctionName=function['FunctionName'],
            Role=response['Role']['Arn']
        )

        print(f"Function {function['FunctionName']} now has its own IAM role {new_role_name}")
    else:
        print(f"Function {function['FunctionName']} is not sharing its IAM role with any other function")
```

This script will loop through all the functions in your account and check if they are sharing their IAM role with any other function. If a function is sharing its IAM role, the script will create a new IAM role for the function, attach the necessary policies to the new role, and update the function to use the new IAM role.
