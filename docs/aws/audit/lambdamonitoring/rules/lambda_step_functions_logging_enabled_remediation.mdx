### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Lambda console.
3. In the navigation pane, choose "Functions".
4. Select the function you want to check.
5. In the function's detail page, scroll down to the "Monitoring tools" section.
6. Check if "CloudWatch Logs" is enabled. If it is not, then the Lambda function does not have logging enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to list all the state machines in your AWS account. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws stepfunctions list-state-machines --region your-region-name
```

This command will return a list of ARNs for all the state machines in your account.

2. Next, you need to describe each state machine to get its details. You can do this by using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws stepfunctions describe-state-machine --state-machine-arn your-state-machine-arn --region your-region-name
```

Replace 'your-state-machine-arn' with the ARN of each state machine you got from the previous step. This command will return the details of the state machine including its logging configuration.

3. Check the 'loggingConfiguration' field in the response. If the 'level' field is not set to 'ALL' or if the 'includeExecutionData' field is not set to 'true', then the state machine does not have logging enabled.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each state machine in your account.

#### Using Python

To check if AWS Step Functions have logging enabled in Lambda using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Import the necessary modules and create a session**:
   You need to import Boto3 and create a session using your AWS credentials.

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='us-west-2'
   )
   ```

2. **Create a client for AWS Step Functions**:
   Use the session to create a client for AWS Step Functions.

   ```python
   sfn_client = session.client('stepfunctions')
   ```

3. **List all state machines**:
   Use the `list_state_machines` method to get a list of all state machines.

   ```python
   state_machines = sfn_client.list_state_machines()['stateMachines']
   ```

4. **Check if logging is enabled**:
   For each state machine, use the `describe_state_machine_for_execution` method to get its details and check if logging is enabled.

   ```python
   for state_machine in state_machines:
       state_machine_arn = state_machine['stateMachineArn']
       state_machine_details = sfn_client.describe_state_machine_for_execution(
           stateMachineArn=state_machine_arn
       )
       logging_configuration = state_machine_details['loggingConfiguration']
       if logging_configuration['level'] == 'OFF':
           print(f"Logging is not enabled for state machine: {state_machine_arn}")
   ```

This script will print the ARN of all state machines that do not have logging enabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Step Functions not having logging enabled for AWS Lambda using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console and login with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to Step Functions**: In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the Step Functions service by either typing "Step Functions" in the search bar or locating it under the "Services" dropdown menu.

3. **Select the Step Function**: Click on the Step Function that is associated with the AWS Lambda function for which you want to enable logging.

4. **Edit the State**: In the Step Function's graphical representation, find the state that invokes the AWS Lambda function. Click on that state to edit its configuration.

5. **Enable Logging**: Look for an option to enable logging for the state. This option is usually found in the configuration settings of the state. Enable the logging option and configure the desired log settings such as log level, log format, and log destination.

6. **Save the Changes**: After enabling logging and configuring the settings, save the changes to update the state configuration.

7. **Test the Step Function**: Run a test on the Step Function to ensure that logging is now enabled for the AWS Lambda function.

By following these steps, you will successfully remediate the misconfiguration of Step Functions not having logging enabled for AWS Lambda using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Step Functions not having logging enabled for AWS Lambda using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions to make changes to Step Functions and Lambda functions.

2. Enable logging for your Step Functions by updating the state machine using the AWS CLI command `update-state-machine`. Replace `STATE_MACHINE_ARN` with the ARN of your Step Function and `LOGGING_ARN` with the ARN of the CloudWatch Logs group where you want to store the logs.

```bash
aws stepfunctions update-state-machine --state-machine-arn STATE_MACHINE_ARN --logging-configuration "{ 'level': 'ALL', 'includeExecutionData': true, 'destinations': [{ 'cloudWatchLogsLogGroup': { 'logGroupArn': 'LOGGING_ARN' } }]}"
```

3. Next, you need to update your Lambda function to ensure that it sends logs to CloudWatch Logs. Update the Lambda function configuration using the AWS CLI command `update-function-configuration`. Replace `FUNCTION_NAME` with the name of your Lambda function.

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name FUNCTION_NAME --cli-connect-timeout 60 --cli-read-timeout 60 --logging-config "{ 'logGroupName': 'LOGGING_ARN', 'logType': 'Tail' }"
```

4. Verify that the logging configuration has been successfully updated for both the Step Function and the Lambda function by checking the respective configurations in the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS CLI commands `describe-state-machine` and `get-function-configuration`.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Step Functions not having logging enabled for AWS Lambda using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Step Functions not having logging enabled for AWS Lambda using Python, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Step Functions service.
2. Click on the Step Function that needs to have logging enabled.
3. Click on the "Edit" button to modify the state machine.
4. In the state machine definition, add a new field called "LoggingConfiguration" with the desired logging configuration. Here is an example of how you can add logging using Python:

```python
{
  "Comment": "A simple AWS Step Functions state machine that logs execution history",
  "StartAt": "HelloWorld",
  "States": {
    "HelloWorld": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:function:FUNCTION_NAME",
      "End": true
    }
  },
  "LoggingConfiguration": {
      "Level": "ALL"
  }
}
```

Replace `REGION`, `ACCOUNT_ID`, and `FUNCTION_NAME` with your specific values.

5. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes to the state machine.
6. Test the state machine to ensure that logging is now enabled for the AWS Lambda function.

By following these steps and adding the `LoggingConfiguration` field to the state machine definition, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Step Functions not having logging enabled for AWS Lambda using Python.
