To remediate the misconfiguration "AWS Lambda Should Have DLQ Configured" in AWS using AWS console, follow the steps below:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Lambda service.

2. Select the Lambda function that needs to be remediated.

3. In the Configuration tab, scroll down to the "Dead letter queue" section and click on "Edit".

4. In the "Dead letter queue" section, select "Enable" and then select an existing SNS topic or create a new one.

5. Set the maximum number of times the function can retry failed executions. This is the number of times that AWS Lambda attempts to run your function before sending the event to the dead letter queue.

6. Click on "Save" to save the configuration.

7. Verify that the Dead Letter Queue is configured properly by testing the Lambda function with a sample event. 

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "AWS Lambda Should Have DLQ Configured" in AWS using the AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
Step by step instructions on how to remediate AWS Lambda Should Have DLQ Configured using AWS CLI are:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.
2. Run the following command to list all the Lambda functions in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws lambda list-functions
   ```

3. Identify the Lambda function that needs to be remediated and note down its name.
4. Run the following command to update the Lambda function and add a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) configuration:

   ```
   aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <function-name> --dead-letter-config TargetArn=<arn-of-the-SQS-queue>
   ```

   Replace `<function-name>` with the name of the Lambda function that needs to be remediated and `<arn-of-the-SQS-queue>` with the ARN of the SQS queue that should be used as the DLQ for this function.

5. Verify that the DLQ configuration has been added to the Lambda function by running the following command:

   ```
   aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name <function-name>
   ```

   Replace `<function-name>` with the name of the Lambda function that was remediated.

6. Ensure that the SQS queue has the necessary permissions to invoke the Lambda function by adding the following policy to the SQS queue:

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
               },
               "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
               "Resource": "<arn-of-the-SQS-queue>",
               "Condition": {
                   "ArnEquals": {
                       "aws:SourceArn": "<arn-of-the-Lambda-function>"
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   Replace `<arn-of-the-SQS-queue>` with the ARN of the SQS queue and `<arn-of-the-Lambda-function>` with the ARN of the Lambda function that was remediated.

7. Verify that the SQS queue has the necessary permissions to invoke the Lambda function by running the following command:

   ```
   aws lambda get-policy --function-name <function-name>
   ```

   Replace `<function-name>` with the name of the Lambda function that was remediated.

With these steps, you have successfully remediated the AWS Lambda Should Have DLQ Configured misconfiguration using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the AWS Lambda misconfiguration of not having a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) configured, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. Open the AWS Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.

2. Click on the "Configuration" tab.

3. Scroll down to the "Dead Letter Queue" section and click on "Edit".

4. Select the option "Enable Dead Letter Queue" and choose an existing SQS queue or create a new one.

5. Set the "Maximum Receives" value to the desired number of times a message can be unsuccessfully processed before being sent to the DLQ.

6. Click on "Save" to apply the changes.

Alternatively, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to remediate the misconfiguration programmatically. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import boto3

lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')

function_name = 'my-lambda-function'
dlq_arn = 'arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:123456789012:my-dlq'

response = lambda_client.update_function_configuration(
    FunctionName=function_name,
    DeadLetterConfig={
        'TargetArn': dlq_arn,
        'MaxTriggers': 3
    }
)

print(response)
```

In this example, we're using the `update_function_configuration` method to set the DLQ configuration for a Lambda function. The `DeadLetterConfig` parameter takes a dictionary with the `TargetArn` and `MaxTriggers` values. The `TargetArn` is the ARN of the SQS queue to use as the DLQ, and `MaxTriggers` is the maximum number of times a message can be unsuccessfully processed before being sent to the DLQ.
