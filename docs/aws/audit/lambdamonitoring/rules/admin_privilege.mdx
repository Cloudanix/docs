---

### More Info:

### Risk Level

High

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

CBP, PCIDSS, HIPAA, APRA, MAS, NIST

### Remediation

How to implement the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP) and provide Lambda functions with the right set of required permissions?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Identify the specific actions and resources that your Lambda function needs to perform its intended functionality. This includes accessing other AWS services, interacting with databases, reading from or writing to storage, etc.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Lambda Functions Should Not Have Administrative Permissions" Policy.)
2. Determine the minimum set of permissions required for the Lambda function to perform those actions. It is crucial to limit the permissions to only what is necessary and avoid granting unnecessary or overly broad permissions.
3. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.
4. Click on "Roles" in the navigation panel on the left side.
5. Create a new IAM role by clicking on the "Create role" button.
6. Select the "AWS service" as the trusted entity.
7. Choose "Lambda" as the service that will use this role.
8. Click on the "Next: Permissions" button.
9. In the "Attach permissions policies" section, click on the "Create policy" button.
10. Create a custom IAM policy that defines the specific permissions required by your Lambda function. You can use the policy visual editor or JSON to define the policy. Be sure to include only the necessary actions and resources.
11. Click on the "Review policy" button.
12. Provide a name and description for the policy.
13. Click on the "Create policy" button.
14. Go back to the IAM role creation wizard and click on the "Refresh" button to see the newly created policy.
15. Select the policy you just created by checking the checkbox next to it.
16. Click on the "Next: Tags" button (optional) and add any necessary tags to the role.
17. Click on the "Next: Review" button.
18. Provide a name and description for the IAM role.
19. Click on the "Create role" button.
20. Once the IAM role is created, go to the Lambda function configuration.
21. In the Lambda function details page, scroll down to the "Permissions" section.
22. Under "Execution role," click on the "Edit" button.
23. Select the IAM role you created in the previous steps.
24. Click on the "Save" button.
25. Your Lambda function is now associated with the IAM role that has the least privileges required for its functionality.
