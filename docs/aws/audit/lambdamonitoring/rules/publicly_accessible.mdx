### Remediation

How to prohibit public access in lambda function?

#### Using AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Lambda service.
2. Select the Lambda function for which you want to prohibit public access.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Lambda Functions Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" Policy.)
3. In the function details page, scroll down to the "Configuration" tab.
4. Under the "Permissions" section, ensure that the function is not associated with any publicly accessible triggers, such as API Gateway with a publicly accessible endpoint.
5. Scroll further down to the "Network" section. If your Lambda function needs to be accessed only from within a VPC, ensure that it is configured to run inside a VPC and is not accessible over the internet.
6. If the Lambda function needs to be publicly accessible for specific use cases, ensure that you have implemented appropriate security measures, such as authentication and authorization mechanisms, to control access to the function.
7. Review the IAM roles and permissions associated with the Lambda function. Make sure that only authorized entities have permissions to invoke the function.
8. Test the Lambda function to verify that it is not accessible to the public. You can do this by attempting to invoke the function without proper authentication or by checking that the function is not exposed through publicly accessible endpoints or APIs.
