### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Lambda service. In the navigation pane, choose "Functions".
3. Select the Lambda function that you want to inspect.
4. In the function's configuration page, under the "Configuration" tab, look for the "VPC" section. If the Lambda function is not associated with a VPC, it means it has access to resources outside the VPC. If it is associated with a VPC, check the security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) associated with the VPC to determine what resources the Lambda function can access. 
5. Additionally, you can check the IAM role associated with the Lambda function. In the "Execution role" section of the function's configuration page, click on the role name to navigate to the IAM console. Check the policies attached to the role to see if it has permissions to access VPC-only resources.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to list all your Lambda functions. You can do this by using the AWS CLI command `aws lambda list-functions`. This command will return a JSON object with all your Lambda functions.

2. Once you have the list of Lambda functions, you can check each function's configuration to see if it has access to VPC-only resources. You can do this by using the `aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name FUNCTION_NAME` command, replacing `FUNCTION_NAME` with the name of each function from the list.

3. In the returned JSON object, look for the `VpcConfig` field. If the function has access to VPC-only resources, this field will contain a `VpcId`, `SubnetIds`, and `SecurityGroupIds`.

4. If the `VpcConfig` field is not present or is empty, then the Lambda function does not have access to VPC-only resources. If the `VpcConfig` field is present and contains a `VpcId`, `SubnetIds`, and `SecurityGroupIds`, then the Lambda function does have access to VPC-only resources.

#### Using Python

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) modules in your Python script. You will need the 'boto3' module to interact with AWS services and the 'json' module to parse the AWS service responses.

```python
import boto3
import json
```

2. Create a session using your AWS credentials. Replace 'aws_access_key_id', 'aws_secret_access_key', and 'region_name' with your actual AWS credentials and the region where your Lambda functions are deployed.

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

3. Create a client for 'lambda' using the session object. This client will allow you to interact with AWS Lambda.

```python
lambda_client = session.client('lambda')
```

4. Use the 'list_functions' method of the lambda_client to get a list of all Lambda functions. For each function, check if the 'VpcConfig' attribute is present and if it has a 'VpcId' attribute. If the 'VpcId' attribute is not present, it means that the Lambda function does not have access to VPC-only resources.

```python
response = lambda_client.list_functions()
for function in response['Functions']:
    if 'VpcConfig' in function:
        if 'VpcId' not in function['VpcConfig']:
            print(f"Lambda function {function['FunctionName']} does not have access to VPC-only resources.")
    else:
        print(f"Lambda function {function['FunctionName']} does not have access to VPC-only resources.")
```

This script will print the names of all Lambda functions that do not have access to VPC-only resources.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Lambda Should Have Access To VPC-only Resources" for AWS using AWS console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Go to the AWS Lambda console.
2. Select the Lambda function that needs to access VPC-only resources.
3. Click on the "Configuration" tab.
4. Scroll down to the "Network" section.
5. Click on "Edit".
6. Select the VPC that has the required resources.
7. Select the subnets that the Lambda function needs to access.
8. If required, select the security groups that the Lambda function needs to access.
9. Click on "Save" to apply the changes.

By following the above steps, the Lambda function will have access to VPC-only resources.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Lambda Should Have Access To VPC-only Resources" in AWS using AWS CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to create a new VPC configuration file:

```
aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block <CIDR_BLOCK>
```

Here, replace `<CIDR_BLOCK>` with the CIDR block range you want to use for your VPC.

3. Run the following command to create a new subnet within the VPC:

```
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <VPC_ID> --cidr-block <SUBNET_CIDR_BLOCK>
```

Here, replace `<VPC_ID>` with the ID of the VPC you created in step 2 and `<SUBNET_CIDR_BLOCK>` with the CIDR block range you want to use for your subnet.

4. Run the following command to create a new security group for the Lambda function:

```
aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name <SECURITY_GROUP_NAME> --description "<SECURITY_GROUP_DESCRIPTION>" --vpc-id <VPC_ID>
```

Here, replace `<SECURITY_GROUP_NAME>` with the name you want to give your security group, `<SECURITY_GROUP_DESCRIPTION>` with a brief description of the security group, and `<VPC_ID>` with the ID of the VPC you created in step 2.

5. Run the following command to modify the security group to allow inbound traffic from the VPC:

```
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <SECURITY_GROUP_ID> --protocol all --cidr <SUBNET_CIDR_BLOCK>
```

Here, replace `<SECURITY_GROUP_ID>` with the ID of the security group you created in step 4 and `<SUBNET_CIDR_BLOCK>` with the CIDR block range of the subnet you created in step 3.

6. Run the following command to create a new execution role for the Lambda function:

```
aws iam create-role --role-name <ROLE_NAME> --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
```

Here, replace `<ROLE_NAME>` with the name you want to give your execution role and `trust-policy.json` with the file path to your trust policy document.

7. Run the following command to attach the necessary policies to the execution role:

```
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name <ROLE_NAME> --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole
```

Here, replace `<ROLE_NAME>` with the name of the execution role you created in step 6.

8. Run the following command to update the Lambda function to use the VPC and security group:

```
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <FUNCTION_NAME> --vpc-config SubnetIds=<SUBNET_ID>,SecurityGroupIds=<SECURITY_GROUP_ID> --role <ROLE_ARN>
```

Here, replace `<FUNCTION_NAME>` with the name of the Lambda function you want to update, `<SUBNET_ID>` with the ID of the subnet you created in step 3, `<SECURITY_GROUP_ID>` with the ID of the security group you created in step 4, and `<ROLE_ARN>` with the ARN of the execution role you created in step 6.

9. Run the following command to test the Lambda function to ensure it has access to VPC-only resources:

```
aws lambda invoke --function-name <FUNCTION_NAME> --payload '{}' output.json
```

Here, replace `<FUNCTION_NAME>` with the name of the Lambda function you updated in step 8.

These steps should remediate the misconfiguration "Lambda Should Have Access To VPC-only Resources" in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Lambda function not having access to VPC-only resources in AWS, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Lambda service page.
2. Locate the Lambda function that needs to access VPC-only resources and click on it.
3. Click on the "Configuration" tab and scroll down to the "VPC" section.
4. Click on the "Edit" button to edit the VPC configuration.
5. Select the VPC that the Lambda function needs to access and select at least one subnet in each Availability Zone.
6. Select the security groups that allow access to the resources needed by the Lambda function.
7. Click on the "Save" button to save the updated VPC configuration.

Now, the Lambda function will have access to VPC-only resources. 

Here is a sample Python code to create a Lambda function with access to VPC-only resources: 

```
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Create an EC2 client
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    
    # Describe instances in the VPC
    response = ec2.describe_instances()
    
    # Print the instances
    for reservation in response["Reservations"]:
        for instance in reservation["Instances"]:
            print(instance["InstanceId"])
```

Make sure to attach the appropriate VPC and security group to the Lambda function while creating it.
