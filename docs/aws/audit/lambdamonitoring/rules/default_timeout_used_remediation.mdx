1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Lambda service by typing 'Lambda' into the search bar and selecting 'Lambda' from the dropdown menu.
3. Once you are in the Lambda service, you will see a list of all your Lambda functions. Click on the name of the function you want to check.
4. In the function's configuration page, look for the 'Basic settings' section. Here, you will see the 'Timeout' setting. If the timeout is not set or is set to a value higher than your organization's standard, then it is a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to list all the Lambda functions in your AWS account. You can do this by using the AWS CLI command `aws lambda list-functions`. This command will return a JSON object with all your Lambda functions.

    ```
    aws lambda list-functions --region your-region
    ```

2. Once you have the list of all Lambda functions, you can iterate over each function to get its configuration details. You can use the `aws lambda get-function-configuration` command to get the configuration details of a specific Lambda function.

    ```
    aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name your-function-name --region your-region
    ```

3. In the returned JSON object, look for the `Timeout` attribute. This attribute specifies the amount of time that Lambda allows a function to run before stopping it. If the `Timeout` attribute is not set or is set to a value greater than the recommended maximum, then the function is considered to have a misconfiguration.

4. You can automate the above steps using a Python script. Use the `boto3` library to interact with AWS services. The script will list all Lambda functions, get their configuration details, and check the `Timeout` attribute for each function. If the `Timeout` attribute is not set or is set to a value greater than the recommended maximum, the script will print the function name and its timeout value.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. This can be done using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Establish a session with AWS: You need to establish a session with AWS using your access key, secret access key, and the region. Replace 'your_access_key', 'your_secret_access_key', and 'your_region' with your actual AWS credentials.

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='your_access_key',
       aws_secret_access_key='your_secret_access_key',
       region_name='your_region'
   )
   ```

3. Get a list of all Lambda functions: Use the `list_functions` method to get a list of all Lambda functions in your account.

   ```python
   lambda_client = session.client('lambda')
   functions = lambda_client.list_functions()
   ```

4. Check the timeout for each function: For each function in the list, check the 'Timeout' attribute. If it's not set, the function doesn't have a default timeout set.

   ```python
   for function in functions['Functions']:
       if 'Timeout' not in function:
           print(f"Lambda function {function['FunctionName']} does not have a default timeout set.")
   ```

This script will print the names of all Lambda functions that do not have a default timeout set.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration of Lambda Functions not having a default timeout set in AWS:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Lambda service.
2. Click on the name of the Lambda function that needs to be remediated.
3. Scroll down to the Basic settings section and click on the Edit button next to the Timeout value.
4. Set an appropriate timeout value for the function, keeping in mind the function's execution time and any dependencies it may have.
5. Click on the Save button to apply the changes.

That's it! The Lambda function now has a default timeout set, which helps ensure that it doesn't run indefinitely and incur unnecessary costs.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Lambda Functions Should Have Default Timeout Set" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your computer.

2. Run the following command to get a list of all the Lambda functions in your AWS account:

```
aws lambda list-functions
```

3. Identify the Lambda function that does not have a default timeout set.

4. Run the following command to set a default timeout for the identified Lambda function:

```
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <function-name> --timeout <timeout-value>
```

Replace `<function-name>` with the name of the identified Lambda function and `<timeout-value>` with the timeout value you want to set in seconds. For example, if you want to set the timeout to 5 minutes, you can set the `<timeout-value>` to 300.

5. Verify that the default timeout has been set for the Lambda function by running the following command:

```
aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name <function-name>
```

Replace `<function-name>` with the name of the identified Lambda function. The output should include the timeout value you set in the previous step.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for any other Lambda functions that do not have a default timeout set.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Lambda Functions Should Have Default Timeout Set" for AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "Lambda Functions Should Have Default Timeout Set" for AWS using Python:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Lambda service page.
2. Select the Lambda function for which you want to set the default timeout.
3. Click on the "Configuration" tab.
4. Scroll down to the "General configuration" section.
5. Under "Basic settings", click on the "Edit" button.
6. Set the "Timeout" value to a default value of your choice. For example, you can set it to 30 seconds.
7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Here is the Python code to set the default timeout for an AWS Lambda function:

```python
import boto3

# Replace 'function_name' with the name of the Lambda function for which you want to set the default timeout
function_name = '<function_name>'

# Replace 'timeout' with the default timeout value in seconds
timeout = 30

# Create a Lambda client
lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')

# Update the function configuration
response = lambda_client.update_function_configuration(
    FunctionName=function_name,
    Timeout=timeout
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

Make sure you have the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed before running this code. You can install it using the following command:

```
pip install boto3
```

That's it! This code will set the default timeout for the specified Lambda function.
