1. **Navigate to the Lambda Console:**
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - In the Services menu, select "Lambda" to go to the AWS Lambda console.

2. **Select the Lambda Function:**
   - In the Lambda console, you will see a list of your Lambda functions.
   - Click on the name of the Lambda function for which you want to configure concurrency.

3. **Configure Concurrency:**
   - In the function's configuration page, scroll down to the "Concurrency" section.
   - Click on the "Edit" button in the Concurrency section.

4. **Set Reserved Concurrency:**
   - In the "Reserved concurrency" field, enter the number of concurrent executions you want to reserve for this function.
   - Click the "Save" button to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you ensure that your Lambda function has a concurrency limit set, which helps in managing the function's performance and preventing resource overuse.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of not having concurrency configured for an AWS Lambda function using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI:**
   Ensure that the AWS CLI is installed and configured with the necessary permissions to manage Lambda functions.
   ```sh
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Set Reserved Concurrency:**
   Use the `put-function-concurrency` command to set the reserved concurrency for your Lambda function. This limits the number of concurrent executions for the function.
   ```sh
   aws lambda put-function-concurrency --function-name <function-name> --reserved-concurrent-executions <number>
   ```

3. **Verify Concurrency Configuration:**
   Confirm that the concurrency setting has been applied correctly by using the `get-function-concurrency` command.
   ```sh
   aws lambda get-function-concurrency --function-name <function-name>
   ```

4. **Monitor and Adjust as Needed:**
   Regularly monitor the concurrency settings and adjust them as necessary to ensure optimal performance and cost management.
   ```sh
   aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <function-name> --reserved-concurrent-executions <new-number>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your AWS Lambda functions have the appropriate concurrency settings configured, preventing potential performance issues and resource exhaustion.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of not having concurrency configured in AWS Lambda using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install it using pip.

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials:**
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by setting environment variables.

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   Alternatively, you can set the environment variables directly in your script:

   ```python
   import os

   os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] = 'your_access_key_id'
   os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] = 'your_secret_access_key'
   os.environ['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'] = 'your_default_region'
   ```

3. **Create a Python Script to Configure Concurrency:**
   Use Boto3 to configure the concurrency settings for your Lambda function. Below is a sample script to set the reserved concurrency for a Lambda function.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon Lambda
   client = boto3.client('lambda')

   # Function to set concurrency
   def set_lambda_concurrency(function_name, reserved_concurrent_executions):
       response = client.put_function_concurrency(
           FunctionName=function_name,
           ReservedConcurrentExecutions=reserved_concurrent_executions
       )
       return response

   # Example usage
   function_name = 'your_lambda_function_name'
   reserved_concurrent_executions = 5  # Set the desired concurrency limit

   response = set_lambda_concurrency(function_name, reserved_concurrent_executions)
   print(response)
   ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the Python script to apply the concurrency settings to your Lambda function.

   ```bash
   python set_lambda_concurrency.py
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your AWS Lambda functions have concurrency configured, preventing potential misconfigurations related to unbounded concurrency.

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Lambda console.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Functions".

3. Select the function you want to check for concurrency configuration.

4. In the function's detail page, scroll down to the "Concurrency" section. If there is no concurrency limit set, it means the function is using unreserved concurrency which could potentially lead to throttling issues.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Lambda functions.

2. Once the AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can list all the Lambda functions in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws lambda list-functions --region your-region-name
   ```

   Replace 'your-region-name' with the name of the AWS region where your Lambda functions are deployed. This command will return a JSON object with details about all your Lambda functions.

3. To check the concurrency configuration of a specific Lambda function, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws lambda get-function --function-name your-function-name --region your-region-name
   ```

   Replace 'your-function-name' with the name of the Lambda function you want to check, and 'your-region-name' with the name of the AWS region where the function is deployed. This command will return a JSON object with details about the specified Lambda function.

4. In the returned JSON object, look for the 'Concurrency' field. If this field is not present or if its value is not set, then the Lambda function does not have a concurrency configuration. If the 'Concurrency' field is present and its value is set, then the Lambda function has a concurrency configuration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. First, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. You can do this by running the command `pip install boto3` in your terminal.

2. Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS. You will need your AWS access key and secret access key for this.

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'  # or your preferred region
)
```

3. Create a client for AWS Lambda.

```python
lambda_client = session.client('lambda')
```

4. Now, you can list all your Lambda functions and check if they have a concurrency limit set. If the 'ReservedConcurrentExecutions' key is not present in the function's details, it means that the function does not have a concurrency limit set.

```python
response = lambda_client.list_functions()

for function in response['Functions']:
    function_details = lambda_client.get_function_configuration(
        FunctionName=function['FunctionName']
    )
    if 'ReservedConcurrentExecutions' not in function_details:
        print(f"Lambda function {function['FunctionName']} does not have a concurrency limit set.")
```

This script will print the names of all Lambda functions that do not have a concurrency limit set. You can modify it to suit your needs, for example by writing the results to a file or sending an alert.
