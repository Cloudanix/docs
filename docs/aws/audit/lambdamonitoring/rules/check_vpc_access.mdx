### Remediation

How to ensure that AWS Lambda has access to VPC-only resources

#### Using GCP Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Lambda service.
2. In the Lambda console, select the Lambda function for which you want to configure VPC access or create a new Lambda function.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Lambda Should Have Access To VPC-only Resources" Policy.)
3. Scroll down to the "Configuration" section and click on the "VPC" and then the "Edit" button.
5. In the "VPC" configuration, select the desired VPC from the drop-down menu.
6. Choose the appropriate subnets from the "Subnets" drop-down menu. These subnets should be associated with your VPC-only resources.
7. If you need to configure security groups for the Lambda function, you can choose the security groups from the "Security groups" drop-down menu. Ensure that the selected security groups allow the necessary inbound and outbound traffic for your VPC-only resources.
8. Optionally, you can also assign an elastic network interface (ENI) to the Lambda function by selecting an available ENI from the "ENI" drop-down menu.
9. Click on the "Save" button to save the VPC configuration.
