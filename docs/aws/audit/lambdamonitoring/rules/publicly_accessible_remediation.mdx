How to prohibit public access in lambda function?

#### Using AWS Console

- Step 1: To get the ID of the statement from the output of GetPolicy, from the AWS CLI, run the following:
  aws lambda get-policy —function-name yourfunctionname
  This command returns the Lambda resource-based policy string associated with the publicly accessible Lambda function.

- Step 2: From the policy statement returned by the get-policy command, copy the string value of the Sid field.
- Step 3: From the AWS CLI, run
  aws lambda remove-permission --function-name yourfunctionname —statement-id youridvalue
  To use the Lambda console to restrict access to the Lambda function
  A: Open the AWS Lambda console.
  B: Navigate to Functions and then select your publicly accessible Lambda function.
  C: Under Designer, choose the key icon at the top left. It has the tool-tip View permissions.
  D: Under Function policy, if the policy allows actions for the principal element "_" or
  `{"AWS": "_"}`, it is publicly accessible.
  Consider adding the following IAM condition to scope access to your account only.
  "Condition": \{
  "StringEquals": \{
  "AWS:SourceAccount": "\<account_id\>"
  \}
  \}
  \}
