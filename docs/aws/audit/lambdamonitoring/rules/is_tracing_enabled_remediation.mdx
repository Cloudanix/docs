### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Lambda console. You can do this by typing 'Lambda' into the search bar and selecting 'Lambda' from the dropdown menu.
3. In the AWS Lambda console, you will see a list of all your Lambda functions. Click on the name of the function you want to check.
4. In the function's configuration details, look for the 'Monitoring tools' section. Under 'Tracing', check if 'Active Tracing' is enabled. If it is, then tracing is enabled for that function. If it is not, then tracing is not enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Lambda functions.

2. Once the AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can list all the Lambda functions in your account by running the following command:

   ```
   aws lambda list-functions --region your-region-name
   ```

   Replace 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region. This command will return a JSON object with details about all your Lambda functions.

3. To check if a specific Lambda function has tracing enabled, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name your-function-name --region your-region-name
   ```

   Replace 'your-function-name' with the name of your Lambda function and 'your-region-name' with the name of your AWS region. This command will return a JSON object with the configuration details of the specified Lambda function.

4. In the returned JSON object, look for the 'TracingConfig' field. If the 'Mode' field under 'TracingConfig' is set to 'Active', then tracing is enabled for the Lambda function. If the 'Mode' field is set to 'PassThrough', then tracing is not enabled.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your environment. This can be done using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS: You need to import Boto3 and establish a session with your AWS account. Replace 'your-region' with the AWS region you're working in.

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       region_name='your-region'
   )
   ```

3. List all Lambda functions and check their tracing configuration: You can use the `list_functions` method to get a list of all Lambda functions in your account. Then, for each function, use the `get_function_configuration` method to get its configuration details. If the 'TracingConfig' field is not set to 'Active', the function does not have tracing enabled.

   ```python
   lambda_client = session.client('lambda')

   functions = lambda_client.list_functions()['Functions']

   for function in functions:
       config = lambda_client.get_function_configuration(
           FunctionName=function['FunctionName']
       )
       if config['TracingConfig']['Mode'] != 'Active':
           print(f"Function {function['FunctionName']} does not have tracing enabled.")
   ```

4. Run the script: Finally, run the script. It will print the names of all Lambda functions that do not have tracing enabled. If no such functions are found, it will not print anything. This script can be run periodically, or triggered by a specific event, to continuously monitor the tracing configuration of your Lambda functions.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Lambda Functions Should Have Tracing Enabled" for AWS using the AWS console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the AWS Lambda console.
2. Select the Lambda function for which you want to enable tracing.
3. Click on the "Configuration" tab.
4. Scroll down to the "Debugging and error handling" section.
5. Under "Debugging and error handling", click on the "Edit" button.
6. In the "Edit function" page, scroll down to the "Tracing" section.
7. Under "Tracing", select the "Active" option.
8. In the "Tracing mode" drop-down, select the "AWS X-Ray" option.
9. Click on the "Save" button at the top of the page to save the changes.

Once the above steps are completed, tracing will be enabled for the selected Lambda function in AWS.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Lambda Functions not having tracing enabled in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine or EC2 instance.

2. Run the following command to enable tracing on all Lambda functions in the AWS account:

```
aws lambda update-function-configuration --tracing-config Mode=Active
```

3. If you want to enable tracing only on specific Lambda functions, run the following command:

```
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <function-name> --tracing-config Mode=Active
```

Replace `<function-name>` with the name of the Lambda function that you want to enable tracing on.

4. Verify that tracing is enabled on the Lambda function by running the following command:

```
aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name <function-name>
```

This command will return the configuration details of the Lambda function, including the tracing mode. If the tracing mode is set to "Active", then tracing is enabled on the function.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Lambda Functions not having tracing enabled in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Lambda Functions not having tracing enabled in AWS, you can follow the below steps using Python:

1. Import the necessary AWS SDK libraries for Python:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Create an AWS Lambda client object:
```python
lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')
```

3. List all the available Lambda functions:
```python
functions = lambda_client.list_functions()
```

4. For each function, check if tracing is enabled or not:
```python
for function in functions['Functions']:
    function_name = function['FunctionName']
    tracing_config = lambda_client.get_function(FunctionName=function_name)['TracingConfig']
    if tracing_config['Mode'] != 'Active':
        # Enable tracing for the function
        lambda_client.update_function_configuration(FunctionName=function_name, TracingConfig={'Mode': 'Active'})
```

5. Save the Python script and execute it to enable tracing for all the available Lambda functions.

With the above steps, you can easily remediate the misconfiguration of Lambda Functions not having tracing enabled in AWS.
