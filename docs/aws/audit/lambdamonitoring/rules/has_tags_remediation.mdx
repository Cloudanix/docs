1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Lambda service by typing 'Lambda' into the search bar and selecting 'Lambda' from the dropdown menu.
3. Once you are in the AWS Lambda console, you will see a list of all your Lambda functions. Click on the name of the function you want to check for tags.
4. In the function's detail page, scroll down to the 'Tags' section. If there are no tags listed, then the Lambda function does not have any tags.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to list all your Lambda functions. Open your terminal and run the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws lambda list-functions --region your-region
```
Replace "your-region" with your actual AWS region. This command will return a list of all your Lambda functions in the specified region.

2. The output will be in JSON format. Each function will have an "FunctionName" field. You can use this field to get more information about each function. 

3. To check if a function has tags, use the following command:

```bash
aws lambda list-tags --resource your-function-arn
```
Replace "your-function-arn" with the actual ARN of your Lambda function. This command will return a list of all tags associated with the specified function.

4. If the output is empty, it means the function doesn't have any tags. If the output contains key-value pairs, these are the tags of your function. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each function in your list.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in your local environment. This will allow you to interact with AWS services including Lambda. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install boto3
```

2. Import the necessary modules and create a session using your AWS credentials:

```python
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Create a client for AWS Lambda:

```python
lambda_client = session.client('lambda')
```

4. Now, you can list all your Lambda functions and check if they have tags. If a function doesn't have tags, print its name:

```python
def check_lambda_tags():
    functions = lambda_client.list_functions()
    for function in functions['Functions']:
        tags = lambda_client.list_tags(Resource=function['FunctionArn'])
        if not tags['Tags']:
            print(f"Lambda function {function['FunctionName']} does not have tags.")

check_lambda_tags()
```

This script will print the names of all Lambda functions that do not have tags. You can run this script regularly to detect any misconfigurations.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the "Lambda Functions Should Have Tags" misconfiguration in AWS using AWS console:

1. Login to your AWS console.
2. Navigate to the AWS Lambda service.
3. Click on the checkbox next to the Lambda function that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Add/Edit Tags" button at the top of the page.
5. In the "Key" field, enter a tag key (e.g. "Environment") that describes the function's purpose or environment.
6. In the "Value" field, enter a tag value (e.g. "Production") that provides additional information about the function.
7. Click on the "Add" button to add the tag to the function.
8. Repeat steps 5-7 for any additional tags that you want to add.
9. Once you have added all necessary tags, click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the "Lambda Functions Should Have Tags" misconfiguration in AWS using AWS console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Lambda Functions Should Have Tags" for AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local machine.

2. Use the following command to list all the Lambda functions in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws lambda list-functions
   ```

3. Identify the Lambda functions that do not have tags associated with them.

4. Use the following command to add tags to a Lambda function:

   ```
   aws lambda tag-resource --resource-arn arn:aws:lambda:<region>:<account-id>:function:<function-name> --tags Key=<tag-key>,Value=<tag-value>
   ```

   Replace `<region>` with the AWS region where the Lambda function is located, `<account-id>` with your AWS account ID, `<function-name>` with the name of the Lambda function that needs to be tagged, `<tag-key>` with the name of the tag you want to add, and `<tag-value>` with the value of the tag you want to add.

   For example:

   ```
   aws lambda tag-resource --resource-arn arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:my-function --tags Key=Environment,Value=Production
   ```

   This command will add a tag to the Lambda function named "my-function" with the key "Environment" and the value "Production".

5. Repeat step 4 for all the Lambda functions that do not have tags associated with them.

6. Verify that all the Lambda functions have tags associated with them by using the following command:

   ```
   aws lambda list-tags --resource arn:aws:lambda:<region>:<account-id>:function:<function-name>
   ```

   Replace `<region>`, `<account-id>`, and `<function-name>` with the appropriate values.

   This command will list all the tags associated with the Lambda function. If the Lambda function has tags associated with it, the output will show the tags. If the Lambda function does not have tags associated with it, the output will be empty.

7. Once you have verified that all the Lambda functions have tags associated with them, the remediation is complete.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Lambda Functions Should Have Tags" in AWS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, import the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) library:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Then, create a Boto3 client for AWS Lambda:
```python
lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')
```

3. Next, use the `list_functions()` method to get a list of all Lambda functions in your account:
```python
response = lambda_client.list_functions()
functions = response['Functions']
```

4. Loop through each Lambda function and check if it has any tags. If not, add a tag with a key-value pair of your choice (e.g. "Environment": "Production"):
```python
for function in functions:
    function_arn = function['FunctionArn']
    tags = lambda_client.list_tags(Resource=function_arn)['Tags']
    if not tags:
        lambda_client.tag_resource(Resource=function_arn, Tags={'Environment': 'Production'})
```

5. Finally, run the Python script and verify that all Lambda functions now have tags:
```python
python lambda_tagging.py
```

Note: You will need to have appropriate AWS credentials configured for Boto3 to be able to access your AWS account.
