<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To ensure that Amazon Macie is enabled in each AWS account per region using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Below are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Install Boto3**: Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already.

    ```bash
    pip install boto3
    ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**: Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by creating a `~/.aws/credentials` file.

3. **Python Script to Enable Macie**: Use the following Python script to enable Macie in all available regions for your AWS account.

    ```python
    import boto3

    def enable_macie_in_all_regions():
        # Create a session using your AWS credentials
        session = boto3.Session()

        # Get a list of all available regions for Macie
        available_regions = session.get_available_regions('macie2')

        for region in available_regions:
            # Create a Macie client for the specific region
            macie_client = session.client('macie2', region_name=region)

            try:
                # Enable Macie in the region
                macie_client.enable_macie(
                    findingPublishingFrequency='FIFTEEN_MINUTES',  # Set the frequency of publishing findings
                    status='ENABLED'
                )
                print(f"Macie enabled in region: {region}")
            except macie_client.exceptions.ConflictException:
                print(f"Macie is already enabled in region: {region}")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error enabling Macie in region {region}: {e}")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        enable_macie_in_all_regions()
    ```

4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to enable Macie in all regions.

    ```bash
    python enable_macie.py
    ```

### Explanation:

1. **Install Boto3**: This step ensures that you have the necessary library to interact with AWS services.
2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**: AWS credentials are required to authenticate and authorize your requests to AWS services.
3. **Python Script to Enable Macie**: The script iterates through all available regions and enables Macie in each region. It handles exceptions to ensure that if Macie is already enabled, it doesn't throw an error.
4. **Run the Script**: This step executes the script, enabling Macie in all regions for your AWS account.

By following these steps, you can ensure that Amazon Macie is enabled in each region for your AWS account, thereby preventing the misconfiguration.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the Macie service.
2. In the navigation pane, select "Settings".
3. In the "Amazon Macie status" section, check if Macie is enabled. If Macie is enabled, the status will be "Enabled". If Macie is not enabled, the status will be "Disabled".
4. Repeat the process for each region by selecting the desired region from the drop-down menu at the top right corner of the console.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure to configure it with the necessary access keys and region.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the `describe-regions` command to list all the regions in your AWS account. Here is the command:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-regions --all-regions --query "Regions[].{Name:RegionName}" --output text
   ```

3. After getting the list of all regions, you can loop through each region and check if Macie is enabled or not. You can do this by using the `get-macie-status` command. Here is the command:

   ```
   for region in `aws ec2 describe-regions --all-regions --query "Regions[].{Name:RegionName}" --output text`; do aws macie2 get-administrator-account --region $region; done
   ```

4. The above command will return the status of Macie in each region. If Macie is not enabled in a region, it will return an error message. You can use this information to detect if Macie is enabled in all regions or not.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Before you can start writing Python scripts to check the status of Macie, you need to install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials to enable Boto3 to communicate with AWS services:

   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You'll be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, which you can find in your AWS Management Console.

2. Import necessary libraries and establish a session: In your Python script, you need to import the necessary libraries and establish a session with AWS. Here's how you can do it:

   ```python
   import boto3

   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='YOUR_REGION'
   )
   ```

3. Create a Macie client and check the status: Now, you can create a Macie client and use it to check the status of Macie in your account. Here's how you can do it:

   ```python
   macie = session.client('macie2')

   response = macie.get_macie_session()

   status = response['status']

   print(f'Macie status: {status}')
   ```
   This script will print the status of Macie in your account. If Macie is enabled, it will print 'ENABLED'. Otherwise, it will print 'PAUSED' or 'USER_INITIATED'.

4. Iterate over all regions: AWS Macie is a regional service. Therefore, you need to check the status of Macie in all regions. You can modify the above script to iterate over all regions as follows:

   ```python
   regions = session.get_available_regions('macie2')

   for region in regions:
       session = boto3.Session(region_name=region)
       macie = session.client('macie2')

       try:
           response = macie.get_macie_session()
           status = response['status']
       except Exception as e:
           status = str(e)

       print(f'Macie status in {region}: {status}')
   ```
   This script will print the status of Macie in all regions. If Macie is not supported in a region, it will print an exception message.
