2. Create a Boto3 client for GuardDuty:

```python
for detector in detectors['DetectorIds']:
    guardduty.update_detector(
        DetectorId=detector,
        FindingPublishingFrequency='ARCHIVE'
    )
```

5. Verify that the findings are now being archived by checking the FindingPublishingFrequency of each detector:
```python
for detector in detectors['DetectorIds']:
    response = guardduty.get_detector(
        DetectorId=detector
    )
    print(f"Detector {detector} finding publishing frequency: {response['FindingPublishingFrequency']}")
```

By following these steps and running the Python script, you can remediate the non-archived findings enabled for GuardDuty in AWS Shield.
