### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Shield console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/shield/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Protected resources". 

3. In the "Protected resources" section, select the resource for which you want to check the Shield Advanced settings.

4. In the details pane, under "AWS Shield Advanced", check the "Subscription" section. If the "Auto Renew" setting is enabled, it will be indicated here. If not, the Shield Advanced setting is not set to auto-renew.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all the subscriptions: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the AWS Shield Advanced subscriptions in your account:

   ```
   aws shield list-subscriptions
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the AWS Shield Advanced subscriptions in your account.

3. Describe the subscription: For each subscription in the list, use the following AWS CLI command to get detailed information about the subscription:

   ```
   aws shield describe-subscription --subscription-arn <subscription-arn>
   ```

   Replace `<subscription-arn>` with the ARN of the subscription you want to check. This command will return detailed information about the subscription, including the auto-renew setting.

4. Check the auto-renew setting: In the output of the `describe-subscription` command, look for the `AutoRenew` field. If the value of this field is `ENABLED`, then the Shield Advanced subscription is set to auto-renew. If the value is `DISABLED`, then it is not set to auto-renew.

#### Using Python

To check if Shield Advanced Setting is set to Auto Renew in AWS Shield using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Setup AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. **Import Boto3 and Initialize AWS Shield Client:**
   Now, you can import Boto3 in your Python script and initialize the AWS Shield client.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a Shield client
   client = boto3.client('shield')
   ```

3. **Call the DescribeSubscription API:**
   You can use the `describe_subscription` API to get the details of the Shield Advanced subscription.

   ```python
   response = client.describe_subscription()
   ```

4. **Check the AutoRenew Attribute:**
   The response of the `describe_subscription` API includes the `AutoRenew` attribute. You can check this attribute to see if it is set to 'ENABLED'.

   ```python
   auto_renew = response['Subscription']['AutoRenew']
   if auto_renew == 'ENABLED':
       print("Shield Advanced Setting is set to Auto Renew")
   else:
       print("Shield Advanced Setting is not set to Auto Renew")
   ```

This script will print whether the Shield Advanced Setting is set to Auto Renew or not.

6. **Review and Confirm**: Review the changes you have made to ensure that the auto-renewal setting is now enabled for your AWS Shield Advanced subscription.

7. **Save Changes**: Once you have confirmed that the auto-renewal setting is enabled, click on the "Save" or "Update" button to save the changes.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of AWS Shield Advanced setting not being set to auto-renew. This ensures that your AWS Shield Advanced subscription will automatically renew at the end of its term, providing continuous protection for your AWS resources against DDoS attacks.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of the Shield Advanced setting not being set to auto-renew in AWS using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt window.

2. Use the AWS CLI command to enable auto-renewal for Shield Advanced. Run the following command:

```bash
aws shield update-subscription --auto-renew
```

3. Verify that the setting has been updated successfully by running the following command to describe the Shield subscription:

```bash
aws shield describe-subscription
```

4. Check the output to confirm that the `AutoRenew` field is set to `True`, indicating that auto-renewal is now enabled for Shield Advanced.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration by setting the Shield Advanced subscription to auto-renew using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of AWS Shield Advanced setting not being set to auto renew, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update the Shield Advanced configuration. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this issue:

1. Install Boto3:
   Make sure you have Boto3 installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials:
   Ensure that you have AWS credentials configured on the machine where you will be running the Python script. You can set up your AWS credentials using AWS CLI by running:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```

3. Write a Python script to update the Shield Advanced configuration:
   Create a Python script with the following code snippet to update the Shield Advanced configuration to enable auto-renewal:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def update_shield_advanced_auto_renew():
       shield = boto3.client('shield')

       response = shield.update_subscription(
           AutoRenew=True
       )

       print("Auto Renewal for Shield Advanced has been enabled successfully.")

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       update_shield_advanced_auto_renew()
   ```

4. Run the Python script:
   Save the Python script with a meaningful name (e.g., `update_shield_auto_renew.py`) and run it using the following command:
   ```
   python update_shield_auto_renew.py
   ```

5. Verify the Shield Advanced configuration:
   After running the script, verify that the Shield Advanced setting has been updated to auto-renew by checking the AWS Management Console or by running describe_shield_subscription API call.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of AWS Shield Advanced setting not being set to auto renew using Python and Boto3.
