```

4. Check the output to confirm that the `AutoRenew` field is set to `True`, indicating that auto-renewal is now enabled for Shield Advanced.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration by setting the Shield Advanced subscription to auto-renew using the AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of AWS Shield Advanced setting not being set to auto renew, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to update the Shield Advanced configuration. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this issue:

1. Install Boto3:
   Make sure you have Boto3 installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials:
   Ensure that you have AWS credentials configured on the machine where you will be running the Python script. You can set up your AWS credentials using AWS CLI by running:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```

3. Write a Python script to update the Shield Advanced configuration:
   Create a Python script with the following code snippet to update the Shield Advanced configuration to enable auto-renewal:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def update_shield_advanced_auto_renew():
       shield = boto3.client('shield')

       response = shield.update_subscription(
           AutoRenew=True
       )

       print("Auto Renewal for Shield Advanced has been enabled successfully.")

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       update_shield_advanced_auto_renew()
   ```

4. Run the Python script:
   Save the Python script with a meaningful name (e.g., `update_shield_auto_renew.py`) and run it using the following command:
   ```
   python update_shield_auto_renew.py
   ```

5. Verify the Shield Advanced configuration:
   After running the script, verify that the Shield Advanced setting has been updated to auto-renew by checking the AWS Management Console or by running describe_shield_subscription API call.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of AWS Shield Advanced setting not being set to auto renew using Python and Boto3.
