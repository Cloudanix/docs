<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To ensure that AWS Shield Advanced is set to auto-renew using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**:
   Ensure that you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions to manage AWS Shield Advanced settings.

   ```sh
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Enable Shield Advanced Auto-Renew**:
   Use the `update-subscription` command to enable auto-renew for Shield Advanced. This command updates the subscription settings to ensure auto-renewal is enabled.

   ```sh
   aws shield update-subscription --auto-renew ENABLED
   ```

3. **Verify Shield Advanced Subscription**:
   Confirm that the Shield Advanced subscription is set to auto-renew by describing the subscription settings.

   ```sh
   aws shield describe-subscription
   ```

   Look for the `AutoRenew` field in the output to ensure it is set to `ENABLED`.

4. **Monitor and Audit Settings**:
   Regularly monitor and audit your Shield Advanced settings to ensure that auto-renew remains enabled. You can set up a scheduled script or use AWS Config rules to automate this process.

   ```sh
   aws shield describe-subscription
   ```

   You can also use AWS Config to create a custom rule to check the auto-renew status periodically.

By following these steps, you can ensure that AWS Shield Advanced is set to auto-renew, thereby preventing any lapses in protection.

3. **Create a Python Script**:
   Write a Python script to enable auto-renew for AWS Shield Advanced. Below is an example script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon Shield
   client = boto3.client('shield')

   # Function to enable auto-renew for Shield Advanced
   def enable_auto_renew():
       try:
           response = client.update_subscription(
               AutoRenew='ENABLED'
           )
           print("Auto-renew for Shield Advanced has been enabled.")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Error enabling auto-renew: {e}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       enable_auto_renew()
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to enable auto-renew for AWS Shield Advanced:
   ```bash
   python enable_shield_auto_renew.py
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that AWS Shield Advanced is set to auto-renew using a Python script. This will help prevent misconfigurations related to the auto-renewal setting.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Shield console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/shield/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Protected resources". 

3. In the Protected resources section, select the resource that you want to check.

4. In the details pane, under AWS Shield Advanced, check the status of the Auto Renew setting. If it is not set to Auto Renew, then the Shield Advanced setting is misconfigured.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start using AWS CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website. After installation, you need to configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can do this by running the command `aws configure` and then entering your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format when prompted.

2. List all the subscriptions: Use the following AWS CLI command to list all the AWS Shield Advanced subscriptions in your account:

   ```
   aws shield list-subscriptions
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the AWS Shield Advanced subscriptions in your account.

3. Describe the subscription: For each subscription in the list, use the following AWS CLI command to get detailed information about the subscription:

   ```
   aws shield describe-subscription --subscription-arn <subscription-arn>
   ```
   Replace `<subscription-arn>` with the ARN of the subscription you want to check. This command will return detailed information about the subscription, including the auto-renew setting.

4. Check the auto-renew setting: In the output of the `describe-subscription` command, look for the `AutoRenew` field. If the value of this field is `ENABLED`, then the Shield Advanced subscription is set to auto-renew. If the value is `DISABLED`, then it is not set to auto-renew.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Before you can begin using Boto3, you should set up authentication credentials. You can do this by creating a new IAM user in your AWS console, then set your credentials in the AWS credentials file, which is located by default at `~/.aws/credentials`. At a minimum, the credentials file should specify the access key and secret access key. To specify these for the `default` profile, you can use the following format:

   ```bash
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Create a Python script to check Shield Advanced Setting:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a Shield client
   client = boto3.client('shield')

   # Get the Shield Advanced subscription details
   response = client.describe_subscription()

   # Check if AutoRenew is set to 'ENABLED'
   if response['Subscription']['AutoRenew'] != 'ENABLED':
       print("Shield Advanced Setting is not set to Auto Renew")
   else:
       print("Shield Advanced Setting is set to Auto Renew")
   ```

4. Run the Python script: You can run the Python script using any Python environment. If the output is "Shield Advanced Setting is not set to Auto Renew", then there is a misconfiguration. If the output is "Shield Advanced Setting is set to Auto Renew", then there is no misconfiguration.
