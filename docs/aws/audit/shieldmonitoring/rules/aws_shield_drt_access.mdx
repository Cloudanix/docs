<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the Shield Response Team (SRT) from having access to your AWS account using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Policy to Deny SRT Access:**
   Create a policy that explicitly denies access to the Shield Response Team. Save the following JSON policy document to a file named `deny-srt-access-policy.json`:

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Deny",
               "Principal": {
                   "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/ShieldResponseTeamRole"
               },
               "Action": "*",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

2. **Create the Policy in AWS IAM:**
   Use the AWS CLI to create the policy in AWS IAM.

   ```sh
   aws iam create-policy --policy-name DenySRTAccessPolicy --policy-document file://deny-srt-access-policy.json
   ```

3. **Attach the Policy to Relevant IAM Roles/Users:**
   Attach the newly created policy to the IAM roles or users that should be protected from SRT access. Replace `role-name` with the actual role name.

   ```sh
   aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name role-name --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::account-id:policy/DenySRTAccessPolicy
   ```

   Or, if attaching to a user, replace `user-name` with the actual user name.

   ```sh
   aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name user-name --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::account-id:policy/DenySRTAccessPolicy
   ```

4. **Verify Policy Attachment:**
   Verify that the policy has been successfully attached to the intended roles or users.

   ```sh
   aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name role-name
   ```

   Or, for a user:

   ```sh
   aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name user-name
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that the Shield Response Team does not have access to your AWS account using the AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration where the Shield Response Team (SRT) should have access to your AWS account, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to ensure that the necessary IAM roles and policies are in place. Here are the steps to achieve this:

### Step 1: Install Boto3
First, ensure that you have Boto3 installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

### Step 2: Create an IAM Role for SRT
Create an IAM role that the Shield Response Team can assume. This role should have the necessary permissions to access your AWS account.

```python
import boto3

# Initialize a session using Amazon IAM
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

# Create the role
role_name = 'ShieldResponseTeamRole'
assume_role_policy_document = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::account-id:root"  # Replace with the SRT AWS account ID
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}

response = iam_client.create_role(
    RoleName=role_name,
    AssumeRolePolicyDocument=json.dumps(assume_role_policy_document),
    Description='Role for Shield Response Team to access the account'
)

print(f"Created role: {response['Role']['Arn']}")
```

### Step 3: Attach Policies to the Role
Attach the necessary policies to the role to grant the Shield Response Team the required permissions.

```python
# Attach a managed policy to the role
policy_arn = 'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSDDoSProtection'  # Example policy ARN

response = iam_client.attach_role_policy(
    RoleName=role_name,
    PolicyArn=policy_arn
)

print(f"Attached policy {policy_arn} to role {role_name}")
```

### Step 4: Verify the Configuration
Ensure that the role and policies are correctly configured by listing the attached policies for the role.

```python
response = iam_client.list_attached_role_policies(
    RoleName=role_name
)

print(f"Attached policies for role {role_name}:")
for policy in response['AttachedPolicies']:
    print(f"- {policy['PolicyName']} ({policy['PolicyArn']})")
```

### Summary
1. **Install Boto3**: Ensure Boto3 is installed.
2. **Create IAM Role**: Create an IAM role for the Shield Response Team with the appropriate trust policy.
3. **Attach Policies**: Attach the necessary policies to the role to grant the required permissions.
4. **Verify Configuration**: List the attached policies to verify the configuration.

By following these steps, you can programmatically ensure that the Shield Response Team has the necessary access to your AWS account using Python scripts.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Shield console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/shield/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Settings". 

3. Under "AWS Shield Response Team access", check if the "Allow access" option is enabled. If it is enabled, it means the Shield Response Team (SRT) has access to your AWS account.

4. For further verification, you can also check the IAM policies and roles in your AWS account. Navigate to the IAM console and check if there are any roles or policies that grant AWS SRT access to your account. The role should be "AWSShieldDRTAccessRole" and the policy should be "AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy". If these roles and policies exist and are attached to the SRT, then the SRT has access to your AWS account.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will need to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "aws shield describe-protection" command to list the details of the AWS Shield protections for your account. This command will return a JSON output with the details of the protections.

   Command: 
   ```
   aws shield describe-protection --protection-id <your-protection-id>
   ```
   Replace `<your-protection-id>` with the ID of the protection you want to check.

3. To check if the Shield Response Team (SRT) has access to your AWS account, you can use the "aws shield describe-assistance" command. This command will return a JSON output with the details of the AWS Shield assistance for your account.

   Command: 
   ```
   aws shield describe-assistance --region <your-region>
   ```
   Replace `<your-region>` with the region where your AWS Shield is configured.

4. If the SRT has access to your AWS account, the "aws shield describe-assistance" command will return a JSON output with the "emergencyAssistancePlan" field set to "ACTIVE". If the SRT does not have access to your AWS account, the "emergencyAssistancePlan" field will be set to "INACTIVE".
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   First, you need to install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can configure your credentials either by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```
   Or, you can create the credential file yourself. By default, its location is at `~/.aws/credentials`. At a minimum, the credentials file should look like this:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

2. Use Boto3 to check Shield Response Team (SRT) access:
   You can use the `describe_subscription` method from the Shield client in Boto3 to check if SRT has access to your AWS account. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a Shield client
   client = boto3.client('shield')

   # Describe the subscription
   response = client.describe_subscription()

   # Check if SRT access is enabled
   if 'AutoRenew' in response and response['AutoRenew'] == 'ENABLED':
       print("SRT has access to the AWS account.")
   else:
       print("SRT does not have access to the AWS account.")
   ```

3. Interpret the results:
   If the script prints "SRT has access to the AWS account.", then the Shield Response Team has access to your AWS account. If it prints "SRT does not have access to the AWS account.", then the Shield Response Team does not have access to your AWS account.

4. Regularly run the script:
   To ensure that the Shield Response Team always has access to your AWS account, you should regularly run the script. You can schedule it to run at regular intervals using a cron job or a similar scheduling tool.

1. **Create an IAM Policy**:
   - Create a new IAM policy that grants the necessary permissions to the Shield Response Team. Below is an example policy that provides full access to AWS Shield resources:
   
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "shield:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

2. **Attach the IAM Policy**:
   - Attach the newly created IAM policy to a new IAM role or an existing IAM role that is assigned to the Shield Response Team. Replace `IAM_ROLE_NAME` with the actual IAM role name.
   
```bash
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name IAM_ROLE_NAME --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/FullAWSShieldAccess
```

3. **Verify Access**:
   - Ensure that the Shield Response Team members can now access AWS Shield resources using the assigned IAM role.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration and provide the Shield Response Team with the necessary access to the AWS account using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of granting Shield Response Team (SRT) access to the AWS account using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Boto3**: Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create an IAM Policy**: Create a new IAM policy that grants the necessary permissions to the Shield Response Team. You can use the following example policy as a starting point:

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",

           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "shield:*",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

3. **Attach the Policy to a Group or User**: You can attach the IAM policy to an existing IAM group that the Shield Response Team members are part of, or directly to individual IAM users.

4. **Use Boto3 to Implement the Remediation**:
   Here is a sample Python script that uses Boto3 to attach the IAM policy to an IAM group:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create an IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # Specify the IAM group name
   group_name = 'YOUR_GROUP_NAME'

   # Specify the ARN of the IAM policy created in step 2
   policy_arn = 'YOUR_POLICY_ARN'

   # Attach the policy to the IAM group
   response = iam.attach_group_policy(
       GroupName=group_name,
       PolicyArn=policy_arn
   )

   print(response)
   ```

5. **Run the Python Script**: Save the Python script in a file (e.g., `remediate_shield_access.py`) and run it using Python. Make sure to replace `'YOUR_GROUP_NAME'` and `'YOUR_POLICY_ARN'` with the actual group name and policy ARN.

By following these steps and running the Python script, you can remediate the misconfiguration and grant the Shield Response Team access to the AWS account.
