<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent misconfigurations related to GuardDuty Centralized Enablement in AWS Shield using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed and configured with the necessary permissions to interact with AWS services.

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script to Enable GuardDuty Centrally:**
   Write a Python script to enable GuardDuty in a centralized manner across multiple AWS accounts. This involves creating a GuardDuty detector in the master account and inviting member accounts.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize GuardDuty client
   guardduty_client = boto3.client('guardduty')

   # Function to create a detector in the master account
   def create_detector():
       response = guardduty_client.create_detector(Enable=True)
       detector_id = response['DetectorId']
       return detector_id

   # Function to invite member accounts
   def invite_members(detector_id, account_ids, email_addresses):
       accounts = [{'AccountId': account_id, 'Email': email} for account_id, email in zip(account_ids, email_addresses)]
       response = guardduty_client.create_members(DetectorId=detector_id, AccountDetails=accounts)
       guardduty_client.invite_members(DetectorId=detector_id, AccountIds=account_ids)
       return response

   # Main function
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       master_detector_id = create_detector()
       member_account_ids = ['123456789012', '234567890123']  # Replace with actual account IDs
       member_emails = ['member1@example.com', 'member2@example.com']  # Replace with actual email addresses
       invite_members(master_detector_id, member_account_ids, member_emails)
   ```

3. **Ensure Proper IAM Permissions:**
   Make sure the IAM role or user running the script has the necessary permissions to manage GuardDuty and invite member accounts. The required permissions include:
   - `guardduty:CreateDetector`
   - `guardduty:CreateMembers`
   - `guardduty:InviteMembers`

   Example IAM policy:

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "guardduty:CreateDetector",
                   "guardduty:CreateMembers",
                   "guardduty:InviteMembers"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

4. **Automate the Script Execution:**
   To ensure GuardDuty is always enabled centrally, you can automate the execution of the script using AWS Lambda or a scheduled task (e.g., using AWS CloudWatch Events).

   Example of setting up a CloudWatch Event rule to trigger the Lambda function:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize CloudWatch Events client
   events_client = boto3.client('events')

   # Create a rule to trigger the Lambda function periodically
   response = events_client.put_rule(
       Name='GuardDutyCentralizedEnablementRule',
       ScheduleExpression='rate(1 day)',  # Adjust the schedule as needed
       State='ENABLED'
   )

   # Add the Lambda function as the target of the rule
   lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')
   lambda_client.add_permission(
       FunctionName='YourLambdaFunctionName',
       StatementId='AllowExecutionFromCloudWatch',
       Action='lambda:InvokeFunction',
       Principal='events.amazonaws.com',
       SourceArn=response['RuleArn']
   )

   events_client.put_targets(
       Rule='GuardDutyCentralizedEnablementRule',
       Targets=[
           {
               'Id': '1',
               'Arn': 'arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:YourLambdaFunctionName'
           }
       ]
   )
   ```

By following these steps, you can prevent misconfigurations related to GuardDuty Centralized Enablement in AWS Shield using Python scripts.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS GuardDuty console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Settings". 

3. Under "General", check the "Multi-account" section. If GuardDuty is not enabled for all accounts, it will show "Partial" or "No" under the "Multi-account" section.

4. To verify the status of GuardDuty for each individual account, navigate to the "Accounts" section in the GuardDuty console. Here, you can see the status of GuardDuty for each linked account. If GuardDuty is not enabled, the status will be shown as "Disabled".
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. **Check AWS Organizations:** First, you need to check if AWS Organizations is enabled in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following AWS CLI command:

    ```
    aws organizations describe-organization
    ```
   If AWS Organizations is not enabled, you will need to enable it before you can centrally manage GuardDuty.

2. **List GuardDuty Detectors:** Next, you need to list all the GuardDuty detectors in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following AWS CLI command:

    ```
    aws guardduty list-detectors
    ```
   This command will return a list of detector IDs. If no detector IDs are returned, it means GuardDuty is not enabled.

3. **Check GuardDuty Status:** For each detector ID, you can check the status of GuardDuty by running the following AWS CLI command:

    ```
    aws guardduty get-detector --detector-id <detector-id>
    ```
   Replace `<detector-id>` with the ID of the detector you want to check. The status of the detector will be returned in the response.

4. **Check GuardDuty Master Account:** Finally, you can check if the current AWS account is the master account for GuardDuty. You can do this by running the following AWS CLI command:

    ```
    aws guardduty get-master-account --detector-id <detector-id>
    ```
   Replace `<detector-id>` with the ID of the detector you want to check. If the current AWS account is the master account, the response will include the AWS account number and the status of the relationship between the master and member accounts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, configure your AWS credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using the AWS CLI. 

2. **Create a Python Script to Check GuardDuty Centralized Enablement:**
   Create a Python script that uses the Boto3 AWS SDK to interact with the GuardDuty service. Here's a basic example of how you might structure this script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_guardduty_enablement():
       client = boto3.client('guardduty')
       detector = client.list_detectors()
       if detector['DetectorIds']:
           for id in detector['DetectorIds']:
               detector_status = client.get_detector(DetectorId=id)
               if detector_status['Status'] == 'ENABLED':
                   print(f"GuardDuty is enabled for detector: {id}")
               else:
                   print(f"GuardDuty is disabled for detector: {id}")
       else:
           print("No GuardDuty detectors found.")

   check_guardduty_enablement()
   ```
   This script lists all GuardDuty detectors and checks if they are enabled or not.

3. **Run the Python Script:**
   Run the Python script from your command line:
   ```
   python check_guardduty.py
   ```
   This will print out the status of all GuardDuty detectors in your AWS account.

4. **Interpret the Results:**
   If the script prints "GuardDuty is enabled for detector: [Detector ID]", then GuardDuty is enabled for that detector. If it prints "GuardDuty is disabled for detector: [Detector ID]", then GuardDuty is not enabled for that detector. If it prints "No GuardDuty detectors found.", then there are no GuardDuty detectors in your AWS account.
