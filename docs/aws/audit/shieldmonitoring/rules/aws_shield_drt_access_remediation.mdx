1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Shield console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/shield/.
   
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Settings". 

3. Under "AWS Shield Response Team access", check if the "Allow access" option is enabled. If it is enabled, it means the Shield Response Team (SRT) has access to your AWS account.

4. For further verification, you can also check the IAM policies and roles in your AWS account. Navigate to the IAM console and check if there are any roles or policies that grant AWS SRT access to your account. The role should be "AWSShieldDRTAccessRole" and the policy should be "AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy". If these roles and policies exist and are attached to the SRT, then the SRT has access to your AWS account.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will need to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "aws shield describe-protection" command to list the details of the AWS Shield protections for your account. This command will return a JSON output with the details of the protections.

   Command: 
   ```
   aws shield describe-protection --protection-id <your-protection-id>
   ```
   Replace `<your-protection-id>` with the ID of the protection you want to check.

3. To check if the Shield Response Team (SRT) has access to your AWS account, you can use the "aws shield describe-assistance" command. This command will return a JSON output with the details of the AWS Shield assistance for your account.

   Command: 
   ```
   aws shield describe-assistance --region <your-region>
   ```
   Replace `<your-region>` with the region where your AWS Shield is configured.

4. If the SRT has access to your AWS account, the "aws shield describe-assistance" command will return a JSON output with the "emergencyAssistancePlan" field set to "ACTIVE". If the SRT does not have access to your AWS account, the "emergencyAssistancePlan" field will be set to "INACTIVE".

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):
   First, you need to install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can configure your credentials either by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```
   Or, you can create the credential file yourself. By default, its location is at `~/.aws/credentials`. At a minimum, the credentials file should look like this:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

2. Use Boto3 to check Shield Response Team (SRT) access:
   You can use the `describe_subscription` method from the Shield client in Boto3 to check if SRT has access to your AWS account. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a Shield client
   client = boto3.client('shield')

   # Describe the subscription
   response = client.describe_subscription()

   # Check if SRT access is enabled
   if 'AutoRenew' in response and response['AutoRenew'] == 'ENABLED':
       print("SRT has access to the AWS account.")
   else:
       print("SRT does not have access to the AWS account.")
   ```

3. Interpret the results:
   If the script prints "SRT has access to the AWS account.", then the Shield Response Team has access to your AWS account. If it prints "SRT does not have access to the AWS account.", then the Shield Response Team does not have access to your AWS account.

4. Regularly run the script:
   To ensure that the Shield Response Team always has access to your AWS account, you should regularly run the script. You can schedule it to run at regular intervals using a cron job or a similar scheduling tool.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of providing Shield Response Team (SRT) access to the AWS account using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create an IAM Policy**:
   - Create a new IAM policy that grants the necessary permissions to the Shield Response Team. Below is an example policy that provides full access to AWS Shield resources:
   
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "shield:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

2. **Attach the IAM Policy**:
   - Attach the newly created IAM policy to a new IAM role or an existing IAM role that is assigned to the Shield Response Team. Replace `IAM_ROLE_NAME` with the actual IAM role name.
   
```bash
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name IAM_ROLE_NAME --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/FullAWSShieldAccess
```

3. **Verify Access**:
   - Ensure that the Shield Response Team members can now access AWS Shield resources using the assigned IAM role.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration and provide the Shield Response Team with the necessary access to the AWS account using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the issue of granting Shield Response Team (SRT) access to the AWS account using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Boto3**: Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Create an IAM Policy**: Create a new IAM policy that grants the necessary permissions to the Shield Response Team. You can use the following example policy as a starting point:

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "shield:*",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

3. **Attach the Policy to a Group or User**: You can attach the IAM policy to an existing IAM group that the Shield Response Team members are part of, or directly to individual IAM users.

4. **Use Boto3 to Implement the Remediation**:
   Here is a sample Python script that uses Boto3 to attach the IAM policy to an IAM group:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create an IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # Specify the IAM group name
   group_name = 'YOUR_GROUP_NAME'

   # Specify the ARN of the IAM policy created in step 2
   policy_arn = 'YOUR_POLICY_ARN'

   # Attach the policy to the IAM group
   response = iam.attach_group_policy(
       GroupName=group_name,
       PolicyArn=policy_arn
   )

   print(response)
   ```

5. **Run the Python Script**: Save the Python script in a file (e.g., `remediate_shield_access.py`) and run it using Python. Make sure to replace `'YOUR_GROUP_NAME'` and `'YOUR_POLICY_ARN'` with the actual group name and policy ARN.

By following these steps and running the Python script, you can remediate the misconfiguration and grant the Shield Response Team access to the AWS account.
