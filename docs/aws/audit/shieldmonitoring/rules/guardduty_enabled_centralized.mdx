1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS GuardDuty console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Settings". 

3. Under "General", check the "Multi-account" section. If GuardDuty is not enabled for all accounts, it will show "Partial" or "No" under the "Multi-account" section.

4. To verify the status of GuardDuty for each individual account, navigate to the "Accounts" section in the GuardDuty console. Here, you can see the status of GuardDuty for each linked account. If GuardDuty is not enabled, the status will be shown as "Disabled".
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. **Check AWS Organizations:** First, you need to check if AWS Organizations is enabled in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following AWS CLI command:

    ```
    aws organizations describe-organization
    ```
   If AWS Organizations is not enabled, you will need to enable it before you can centrally manage GuardDuty.

2. **List GuardDuty Detectors:** Next, you need to list all the GuardDuty detectors in your AWS account. You can do this by running the following AWS CLI command:

    ```
    aws guardduty list-detectors
    ```
   This command will return a list of detector IDs. If no detector IDs are returned, it means GuardDuty is not enabled.

3. **Check GuardDuty Status:** For each detector ID, you can check the status of GuardDuty by running the following AWS CLI command:

    ```
    aws guardduty get-detector --detector-id <detector-id>
    ```
   Replace `<detector-id>` with the ID of the detector you want to check. The status of the detector will be returned in the response.

4. **Check GuardDuty Master Account:** Finally, you can check if the current AWS account is the master account for GuardDuty. You can do this by running the following AWS CLI command:

    ```
    aws guardduty get-master-account --detector-id <detector-id>
    ```
   Replace `<detector-id>` with the ID of the detector you want to check. If the current AWS account is the master account, the response will include the AWS account number and the status of the relationship between the master and member accounts.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, configure your AWS credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using the AWS CLI. 

2. **Create a Python Script to Check GuardDuty Centralized Enablement:**
   Create a Python script that uses the Boto3 AWS SDK to interact with the GuardDuty service. Here's a basic example of how you might structure this script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_guardduty_enablement():
       client = boto3.client('guardduty')
       detector = client.list_detectors()
       if detector['DetectorIds']:
           for id in detector['DetectorIds']:
               detector_status = client.get_detector(DetectorId=id)
               if detector_status['Status'] == 'ENABLED':
                   print(f"GuardDuty is enabled for detector: {id}")
               else:
                   print(f"GuardDuty is disabled for detector: {id}")
       else:
           print("No GuardDuty detectors found.")

   check_guardduty_enablement()
   ```
   This script lists all GuardDuty detectors and checks if they are enabled or not.

3. **Run the Python Script:**
   Run the Python script from your command line:
   ```
   python check_guardduty.py
   ```
   This will print out the status of all GuardDuty detectors in your AWS account.

4. **Interpret the Results:**
   If the script prints "GuardDuty is enabled for detector: [Detector ID]", then GuardDuty is enabled for that detector. If it prints "GuardDuty is disabled for detector: [Detector ID]", then GuardDuty is not enabled for that detector. If it prints "No GuardDuty detectors found.", then there are no GuardDuty detectors in your AWS account.
