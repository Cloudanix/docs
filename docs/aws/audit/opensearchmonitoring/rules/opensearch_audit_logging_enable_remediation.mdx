<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of OpenSearch Audit Logging not being enabled in Amazon OpenSearch using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create an IAM Role for OpenSearch Service:**
   Ensure you have an IAM role with the necessary permissions to enable audit logging. This role should have a trust relationship with the OpenSearch service.

   ```sh
   aws iam create-role --role-name OpenSearchAuditLoggingRole --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
   ```

   The `trust-policy.json` should look something like this:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "Service": "es.amazonaws.com"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Attach the Necessary Policies to the IAM Role:**
   Attach the required policies to the IAM role to allow it to write logs to CloudWatch.

   ```sh
   aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name OpenSearchAuditLoggingRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonOpenSearchServiceCWLRole
   ```

3. **Enable Audit Logging for the OpenSearch Domain:**
   Use the `update-domain-config` command to enable audit logging for your OpenSearch domain.

   ```sh
   aws opensearch update-domain-config --domain-name your-domain-name --log-publishing-options 'AUDIT_LOGS={CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn=arn:aws:logs:region:account-id:log-group:your-log-group-name,Enabled=true}'
   ```

4. **Verify the Configuration:**
   Confirm that the audit logging has been enabled by describing the domain configuration.

   ```sh
   aws opensearch describe-domain --domain-name your-domain-name
   ```

   Look for the `LogPublishingOptions` section in the output to ensure that `AUDIT_LOGS` is enabled and correctly configured.

By following these steps, you can ensure that audit logging is enabled for your Amazon OpenSearch domain using AWS CLI.

   # Initialize a session using Amazon OpenSearch Service
   client = boto3.client('opensearch')

   # Define the domain name
   domain_name = 'your-opensearch-domain-name'

   # Enable audit logging
   response = client.update_domain_config(
       DomainName=domain_name,
       LogPublishingOptions={
           'AUDIT_LOGS': {
               'CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn': 'arn:aws:logs:region:account-id:log-group:log-group-name',
               'Enabled': True
           }
       }
   )

   print(response)
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to enable audit logging for your OpenSearch domain.

   ```bash
   python enable_audit_logging.py
   ```

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the Amazon OpenSearch Service dashboard.
3. In the navigation pane, choose "Domains".
4. For each domain listed, click on the domain name to open its configuration settings. Under the "Cluster Configuration" section, check if the "Enable audit logs" option is enabled. If it's not, then the OpenSearch Audit Logging is not enabled for that particular domain.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official AWS website and configure it using the "aws configure" command. You will be prompted to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the "aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain" command to describe the configuration for the specified Elasticsearch domain. Replace 'domain_name' with the name of your domain.

   ```
   aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain --domain-name 'domain_name'
   ```

3. The output of this command will be a JSON object that contains the configuration information for the specified Elasticsearch domain. Look for the "LogPublishingOptions" field in the output. If the "AuditLogs" field under "LogPublishingOptions" is not present or is set to "DISABLED", then audit logging is not enabled for the specified Elasticsearch domain.

   ```
   "LogPublishingOptions": {
       "AUDIT_LOGS": {
           "CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn": "string",
           "Enabled": false
       }
   }
   ```

4. To check this for all your Elasticsearch domains, you can use the "aws es list-domain-names" command to get a list of all your Elasticsearch domains, and then run the "describe-elasticsearch-domain" command for each domain.

   ```
   for domain in $(aws es list-domain-names --query 'DomainNames[].DomainName' --output text); do aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain --domain-name $domain; done
   ```
   
This will give you the configuration details for all your Elasticsearch domains, and you can check if audit logging is enabled for each domain.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. For this task, you will need the `boto3` library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: To interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by configuring them in the AWS CLI or by setting the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variables.

3. Write the Python script: Now you can write the Python script that checks if Opensearch Audit Logging is enabled. Here is a simple script that does this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_opensearch_audit_logging(domain_name):
       client = boto3.client('es')
       response = client.describe_elasticsearch_domain(DomainName=domain_name)
       domain_config = response['DomainStatus']
       audit_logs_options = domain_config['AdvancedOptions']
       if 'rest.action.structured_logging.enabled' in audit_logs_options:
           if audit_logs_options['rest.action.structured_logging.enabled'] == 'true':
               print(f"Audit logging is enabled for {domain_name}")
           else:
               print(f"Audit logging is not enabled for {domain_name}")
       else:
           print(f"Audit logging is not enabled for {domain_name}")

   check_opensearch_audit_logging('your_domain_name')
   ```

   Replace `'your_domain_name'` with the name of your OpenSearch domain.

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run the script using the Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python check_opensearch_audit_logging.py
   ```

   The script will print whether or not Opensearch Audit Logging is enabled for the specified domain.
