<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of not having Fine-Grained Access Control enabled for OpenSearch Service Domains using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Create an OpenSearch Domain with Fine-Grained Access Control Enabled:**
   When creating a new OpenSearch domain, you can enable Fine-Grained Access Control by specifying the appropriate parameters in the `create-domain` command.

   ```sh
   aws opensearch create-domain --domain-name my-domain \
       --engine-version OpenSearch_1.0 \
       --cluster-config InstanceType=m5.large.search,InstanceCount=2 \
       --ebs-options EBSEnabled=true,VolumeType=gp2,VolumeSize=10 \
       --node-to-node-encryption-options Enabled=true \
       --encryption-at-rest-options Enabled=true \
       --advanced-security-options Enabled=true,InternalUserDatabaseEnabled=true,MasterUserOptions={MasterUserName=admin,MasterUserPassword=AdminPassword123}
   ```

2. **Update an Existing OpenSearch Domain to Enable Fine-Grained Access Control:**
   If you have an existing domain, you can update it to enable Fine-Grained Access Control using the `update-domain-config` command.

   ```sh
   aws opensearch update-domain-config --domain-name my-domain \
       --advanced-security-options Options={Enabled=true,InternalUserDatabaseEnabled=true,MasterUserOptions={MasterUserName=admin,MasterUserPassword=AdminPassword123}}
   ```

3. **Configure Access Policies:**
   Ensure that your domain has the correct access policies to support Fine-Grained Access Control. This can be done using the `update-domain-config` command to set the access policies.

   ```sh
   aws opensearch update-domain-config --domain-name my-domain \
       --access-policies '{
           "Version": "2012-10-17",
           "Statement": [
               {
                   "Effect": "Allow",
                   "Principal": {
                       "AWS": "*"
                   },
                   "Action": "es:*",
                   "Resource": "arn:aws:es:region:account-id:domain/my-domain/*"
               }
           ]
       }'
   ```

4. **Verify Fine-Grained Access Control Configuration:**
   After enabling Fine-Grained Access Control, verify the configuration to ensure it is correctly applied.

   ```sh
   aws opensearch describe-domain --domain-name my-domain
   ```

   Look for the `AdvancedSecurityOptions` in the output to confirm that Fine-Grained Access Control is enabled.

By following these steps, you can ensure that Fine-Grained Access Control is enabled for your OpenSearch Service Domains using AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent the misconfiguration of not having Fine-Grained Access Control enabled in OpenSearch Service Domains using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your environment. If not, you can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials:**
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by setting environment variables:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. **Create a Python Script to Enable Fine-Grained Access Control:**
   Write a Python script that uses Boto3 to enable Fine-Grained Access Control for your OpenSearch Service Domain.

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon OpenSearch Service
   client = boto3.client('opensearch')

   # Define the domain name
   domain_name = 'your-domain-name'

   # Enable Fine-Grained Access Control
   response = client.update_domain_config(
       DomainName=domain_name,
       AdvancedSecurityOptions={
           'Enabled': True,
           'InternalUserDatabaseEnabled': True,
           'MasterUserOptions': {
               'MasterUserARN': 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/master-user',
               'MasterUserName': 'master-username',
               'MasterUserPassword': 'master-password'
           }
       }
   )

   print(response)
   ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script to apply the configuration changes to your OpenSearch Service Domain.

   ```bash
   python enable_fine_grained_access_control.py
   ```

This script will enable Fine-Grained Access Control on the specified OpenSearch Service Domain, ensuring that the domain is properly secured. Make sure to replace `'your-domain-name'`, `'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/master-user'`, `'master-username'`, and `'master-password'` with your actual domain name, IAM user ARN, master username, and password respectively.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the OpenSearch Service dashboard. You can do this by typing "OpenSearch Service" into the search bar at the top of the console, then selecting OpenSearch Service from the dropdown menu.
3. In the OpenSearch Service dashboard, you will see a list of all your OpenSearch domains. Click on the name of the domain you want to check.
4. In the domain configuration page, look for the "Access Policy" section. If the policy is set to "Public Access", then Fine-Grained Access Control is not enabled. If it is set to "Fine-Grained Access Control", then it is enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure AWS CLI: Before you can start, make sure you have AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions. You can install it using pip (Python package installer). 

   ```
   pip install awscli
   ```
   Then configure it using the following command and follow the prompts to input your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

   ```
   aws configure
   ```
2. List OpenSearch Service Domains: Use the following AWS CLI command to list the names of all OpenSearch Service domains available in your AWS account:

   ```
   aws opensearch describe-domain --domain-name <your-domain-name>
   ```
   Replace `<your-domain-name>` with the name of your OpenSearch Service domain.

3. Check Fine-Grained Access Control: In the output of the above command, look for the `AdvancedSecurityOptions` field. If the `Enabled` field under `AdvancedSecurityOptions` is `false`, then Fine-Grained Access Control is not enabled for that domain.

4. Automate the process: If you have multiple domains and want to automate the process, you can use a script to loop through all the domains and check the `AdvancedSecurityOptions` field. Here is a simple Python script using boto3, the AWS SDK for Python:

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('opensearch')

   response = client.list_domain_names()

   for domain in response['DomainNames']:
       domain_name = domain['DomainName']
       domain_details = client.describe_domain(DomainName=domain_name)
       if not domain_details['DomainStatus']['AdvancedSecurityOptions']['Enabled']:
           print(f"Fine-Grained Access Control is not enabled for {domain_name}")
   ```
   This script will print the names of all domains where Fine-Grained Access Control is not enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating the credentials file yourself. By default, its location is at `~/.aws/credentials`. At a minimum, the credentials file should look like this:

   ```bash
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. Write the Python script: Now you can write a Python script that uses Boto3 to check if Fine-Grained Access Control is enabled for OpenSearch Service Domains. Here is a simple script that does this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_fine_grained_access_control():
       client = boto3.client('es')
       domains = client.list_domain_names()
       for domain in domains['DomainNames']:
           domain_name = domain['DomainName']
           domain_config = client.describe_elasticsearch_domain(DomainName=domain_name)
           access_policies = domain_config['DomainStatus']['AccessPolicies']
           if 'Principal' not in access_policies:
               print(f"Fine-Grained Access Control is not enabled for {domain_name}")

   check_fine_grained_access_control()
   ```

   This script first retrieves a list of all OpenSearch Service Domains. Then, for each domain, it retrieves the domain's configuration and checks if the 'Principal' key is present in the access policies. If it's not, it means that Fine-Grained Access Control is not enabled for that domain.

4. Run the Python script: Finally, you can run the Python script using the Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python check_fine_grained_access_control.py
   ```

   The script will print out the names of all OpenSearch Service Domains for which Fine-Grained Access Control is not enabled.
