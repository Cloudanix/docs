### More Info:

This rule verifies whether AWS AppSync resources are associated with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to protect against common web exploits and security vulnerabilities. Associating AppSync with WAF allows for the enforcement of custom access control rules and provides an additional layer of security against malicious traffic

### Risk Level

#### Using Console

To associate AWS AppSync with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) in AWS console, follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console:**
   Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to the AWS Management Console using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to AWS AppSync service:**
   Click on the "Services" dropdown menu at the top of the console, search for "AppSync" in the search bar, and click on "AWS AppSync" to open the AWS AppSync console.

3. **Select the AppSync API:**
   In the AWS AppSync console, select the API that you want to associate with AWS WAF from the list of APIs displayed.

4. **Click on "Settings" tab:**
   Once you have selected the API, click on the "Settings" tab in the left-hand menu to configure the settings for the selected API.

5. **Enable AWS WAF:**
   In the "Settings" tab, look for the "Security" section and find the option to enable AWS WAF. Click on the "Edit" button next to the AWS WAF option.

6. **Associate AWS WAF with the API:**
   In the AWS WAF configuration settings, you can choose to associate an existing AWS WAF web ACL with the API or create a new web ACL. Select the appropriate option based on your requirements.

7. **Configure AWS WAF settings:**
   If you are creating a new web ACL, follow the on-screen instructions to configure the AWS WAF settings such as rules, conditions, and actions to protect your API from common web exploits and attacks.

8. **Save the changes:**
   After configuring the AWS WAF settings, click on the "Save" or "Update" button to associate AWS WAF with the selected AppSync API.

9. **Verify the association:**
   Once the changes are saved, verify that AWS WAF is successfully associated with the AWS AppSync API by checking the settings and configurations in the AWS AppSync console.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration by associating AWS AppSync with AWS WAF in the AWS console to enhance the security of your API.

#### Using CLI

To associate AWS AppSync with AWS WAF using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. Create a WebACL in AWS WAF:
```bash
aws wafv2 create-web-acl --name "MyAppSyncWebACL" --scope REGIONAL --default-action "Allow={}" --description "WebACL for protecting AppSync"
```

2. Get the WebACL ARN:
```bash
export WEBACL_ARN=$(aws wafv2 list-web-acls --scope REGIONAL --query "WebACLs[?Name=='MyAppSyncWebACL'].ARN" --output text)
```

3. Update the AWS AppSync API with the WebACL ARN:
```bash
aws appsync update-graphql-api --api-id YOUR_API_ID --additional-authentication-providers "WAF={WebACLArn=$WEBACL_ARN}"
```
Replace `YOUR_API_ID` with the ID of your AWS AppSync API.

4. Verify the association by checking the AWS AppSync API details:
```bash
aws appsync get-graphql-api --api-id YOUR_API_ID --query "additionalAuthenticationProviders"
```

Now, your AWS AppSync API is associated with AWS WAF for protection.

#### Using Python

To associate AWS AppSync with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Initialize the AWS clients for AppSync and WAF:
```python
appsync_client = boto3.client('appsync')
wafv2_client = boto3.client('wafv2')
```

3. Get the API ID of your AWS AppSync API:
```python
response = appsync_client.list_graph_ql_apis()
api_id = response['graphQLApis'][0]['apiId']
```

4. Create a WebACL in AWS WAF:
```python
web_acl_response = wafv2_client.create_web_acl(
    Name='MyAppSyncWebACL',
    Scope='REGIONAL',  # or set it to 'CLOUDFRONT' if using a CloudFront distribution
    DefaultAction={
        'Allow': {}
    },
    Description='WebACL for protecting AppSync API',
    Rules=[]
)
web_acl_id = web_acl_response['WebACL']['Id']
```

5. Associate the WebACL with your AWS AppSync API:
```python
appsync_client.associate_web_acl(
    ApiId=api_id,
    WebAclArn=web_acl_id
)
```

6. Verify the association:
```python
response = appsync_client.get_web_acl_association(
    ApiId=api_id
)
print(response)
```

By following these steps, you can associate AWS AppSync with AWS WAF using Python. This will help protect your AppSync API from common web attacks and vulnerabilities.
