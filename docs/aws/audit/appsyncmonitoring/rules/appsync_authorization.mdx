### More Info:

This rule evaluates the authorization configuration of AWS AppSync APIs to ensure that appropriate access controls are in place. It verifies whether authentication modes such as API key, IAM, or Cognito user pools are properly configured and whether authorization mechanisms such as fine-grained resolver permissions or GraphQL field-level security are implemented to restrict access to sensitive data.

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AppSync service. You can find this by typing 'AppSync' into the search bar at the top of the console.
3. Once in the AppSync dashboard, select the APIs from the left-hand navigation pane.
4. For each API, check the 'Settings' tab. Under the 'Authorization' section, ensure that an authorization type is set. If no authorization type is set, this indicates a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to list all the available AppSync APIs. You can do this by using the AWS CLI command `list-graphql-apis`. The command is as follows:

```bash
aws appsync list-graphql-apis --region <region-name>
```
Replace `<region-name>` with the name of the AWS region where the APIs are hosted.

2. The output of the above command will give you a list of all the AppSync APIs in the specified region. Each API will have an `apiId`. You can use this `apiId` to get more details about each API.

3. To get the details of an API, use the `get-graphql-api` command. The command is as follows:

```bash
aws appsync get-graphql-api --api-id <api-id> --region <region-name>
```
Replace `<api-id>` with the ID of the API you want to check and `<region-name>` with the name of the AWS region where the API is hosted.

4. The output of the above command will give you the details of the API. Look for the `authorizationConfig` field in the output. If this field is not present or if it is not configured correctly, then the API does not have proper authorization configuration.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You will need the 'boto3' library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Configure AWS Credentials: Boto3 needs your AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) to call AWS services on your behalf. These can be configured in several ways, but the simplest is to use the AWS CLI. Run `aws configure` and then enter your credentials at the prompts.

3. Create a Python script to list all AppSync APIs and check their authorization configuration: 

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('appsync')

   response = client.list_graphql_apis()

   for api in response['graphqlApis']:
       api_id = api['apiId']
       api_name = api['name']
       details = client.get_graphql_api(apiId=api_id)
       auth_type = details['graphqlApi']['authenticationType']
       if auth_type == 'API_KEY':
           print(f"API {api_name} ({api_id}) is using API_KEY authentication.")
   ```

   This script will list all your AppSync APIs and print out those that are using API_KEY authentication, which is less secure than other methods.

4. Run the script: Save your script to a file, then run it with Python. If any of your AppSync APIs are using API_KEY authentication, they will be printed out. If not, the script will not output anything. This will help you detect if any AppSync APIs do not have proper authorization configuration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of AppSync APIs not having authorization configuration in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to AWS AppSync**: Go to the AWS AppSync service by typing "AppSync" in the search bar and selecting it from the options that appear.

3. **Select your API**: In the AWS AppSync console, select the API that you want to configure authorization for from the list of APIs.

4. **Configure Authorization**: In the API details page, click on the "Settings" tab to configure the authorization settings for your API.

5. **Edit Authorization Settings**: Under the "Authorization mode" section, click on the "Edit" button to modify the authorization settings.

6. **Choose Authorization Type**: In the Edit Authorization dialog box, select the appropriate authorization type based on your requirements. You can choose from API Key, IAM, Cognito User Pool, or OpenID Connect.

7. **Configure Authorization**: Depending on the authorization type you selected, configure the settings accordingly. For example, if you choose Cognito User Pool, you will need to select the User Pool ID and App Client ID.

8. **Save Changes**: After configuring the authorization settings, click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

9. **Test Authorization**: It is recommended to test the authorization settings to ensure that they are working as expected. You can do this by making a test request to your API using the configured authorization method.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of AppSync APIs not having authorization configuration in AWS AppSync using the AWS Management Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of AppSync APIs not having authorization configuration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **List all the APIs in AppSync:**
    Run the following AWS CLI command to list all the APIs in AppSync:
    ```bash
    aws appsync list-graphql-apis
    ```

2. **Identify the API without authorization configuration:**
    Check the output of the above command and identify the API that does not have authorization configuration set up.

3. **Update the API with authorization configuration:**
    Run the following AWS CLI command to update the API with the required authorization configuration. Replace `<api-id>` with the actual API ID and `<authorization-type>` with the desired authorization type (e.g., API_KEY, AWS_IAM, AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS, OPENID_CONNECT).
    ```bash
    aws appsync update-graphql-api --api-id <api-id> --authenticationType <authorization-type>
    ```

4. **Verify the authorization configuration:**
    Run the following AWS CLI command to verify that the authorization configuration has been successfully updated for the API:
    ```bash
    aws appsync get-graphql-api --api-id <api-id> --query "graphqlApi.authenticationType"
    ```

5. **Test the API with the new authorization configuration:**
    Test the API to ensure that the authorization configuration is working as expected. You may need to update your client applications to provide the required authorization credentials based on the chosen authentication type.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of AppSync APIs not having authorization configuration in AWS using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of AppSync APIs not having authorization configuration in AWS, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Initialize the AppSync client:
```python
client = boto3.client('appsync')
```

3. List all the existing APIs in your AppSync service:
```python
response = client.list_graph_ql_apis()
```

4. Iterate through the list of APIs and update the authorization configuration for each one:
```python
for api in response['graphQlApis']:
    api_id = api['apiId']
    
    # Update the authorization configuration for the API
    client.update_graph_ql_api(
        apiId=api_id,
        authenticationType='API_KEY',  # You can choose the appropriate authentication type here
        userPoolConfig={
            'userPoolId': 'YOUR_USER_POOL_ID',
            'awsRegion': 'YOUR_AWS_REGION'
        }
    )
```

5. Replace `'YOUR_USER_POOL_ID'` and `'YOUR_AWS_REGION'` with the appropriate values for your setup. You can also choose the appropriate `authenticationType` based on your requirements.

6. Run the Python script to update the authorization configuration for all the APIs in your AppSync service.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of AppSync APIs not having authorization configuration in AWS using Python.
