<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To prevent AppSync APIs from lacking authorization configuration using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create an AppSync API with Authorization Configuration:**
   Ensure that when you create an AppSync API, you specify the authorization type. For example, you can use API key, AWS IAM, OpenID Connect, or Amazon Cognito User Pools.

   ```sh
   aws appsync create-graphql-api \
     --name "MyAppSyncAPI" \
     --authentication-type "API_KEY" \
     --api-key-description "My API Key"
   ```

2. **Update an Existing AppSync API to Add Authorization:**
   If you have an existing AppSync API without authorization, you can update it to include the desired authorization type.

   ```sh
   aws appsync update-graphql-api \
     --api-id <your-api-id> \
     --name "MyUpdatedAppSyncAPI" \
     --authentication-type "AWS_IAM"
   ```

3. **Configure API Key Expiration:**
   If you are using API keys for authorization, ensure that the API keys have an expiration date to enhance security.

   ```sh
   aws appsync create-api-key \
     --api-id <your-api-id> \
     --description "My API Key" \
     --expires <expiration-timestamp>
   ```

4. **Add Additional Authorization Providers:**
   You can add multiple authorization providers to your AppSync API for more robust security. For example, adding Amazon Cognito User Pools.

   ```sh
   aws appsync update-graphql-api \
     --api-id <your-api-id> \
     --additional-authentication-providers "authenticationType=AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS,userPoolConfig={userPoolId=<your-user-pool-id>,awsRegion=<your-region>,appIdClientRegex=<your-app-client-id>}"
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your AppSync APIs have proper authorization configurations, thereby preventing unauthorized access.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To prevent AppSync APIs from lacking authorization configuration in AWS AppSync using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps to ensure that your AppSync APIs have proper authorization configurations:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by setting environment variables:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
   Alternatively, you can set the environment variables directly in your script:
   ```python
   import os
   os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] = 'your_access_key_id'
   os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] = 'your_secret_access_key'
   os.environ['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'] = 'your_region'
   ```

3. **Create or Update AppSync API with Authorization Configuration**:
   Use Boto3 to create or update an AppSync API with the necessary authorization configuration. Hereâ€™s a sample script to ensure that an AppSync API has authorization configured:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize the AppSync client
   client = boto3.client('appsync')

   # Define the authorization configuration
   auth_config = {
       'authorizationType': 'API_KEY',  # or 'AWS_IAM', 'OPENID_CONNECT', 'AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS'
       'apiKeyConfig': {
           'expires': '2023-12-31T23:59:59Z'  # Example expiration date for API key
       }
   }

   # Function to create or update AppSync API with authorization
   def ensure_appsync_auth(api_id, auth_config):
       try:
           # Update the existing AppSync API with authorization configuration
           response = client.update_graphql_api(
               apiId=api_id,
               name='YourAPIName',
               authenticationType=auth_config['authorizationType'],
               additionalAuthenticationProviders=[
                   {
                       'authenticationType': auth_config['authorizationType'],
                       'apiKeyConfig': auth_config.get('apiKeyConfig', {}),
                       'openIDConnectConfig': auth_config.get('openIDConnectConfig', {}),
                       'userPoolConfig': auth_config.get('userPoolConfig', {})
                   }
               ]
           )
           print(f"Updated API {api_id} with authorization configuration.")
       except client.exceptions.NotFoundException:
           # Create a new AppSync API with authorization configuration if it doesn't exist
           response = client.create_graphql_api(
               name='YourAPIName',
               authenticationType=auth_config['authorizationType'],
               additionalAuthenticationProviders=[
                   {
                       'authenticationType': auth_config['authorizationType'],
                       'apiKeyConfig': auth_config.get('apiKeyConfig', {}),
                       'openIDConnectConfig': auth_config.get('openIDConnectConfig', {}),
                       'userPoolConfig': auth_config.get('userPoolConfig', {})
                   }
               ]
           )
           print(f"Created new API with ID {response['graphqlApi']['apiId']} and authorization configuration.")

   # Replace 'your_api_id' with the actual API ID or leave it empty to create a new API
   api_id = 'your_api_id'
   ensure_appsync_auth(api_id, auth_config)
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to ensure that your AppSync API has the necessary authorization configuration. This script will either update an existing API or create a new one with the specified authorization settings.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your AppSync APIs have the appropriate authorization configurations, thereby preventing unauthorized access.

### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AWS AppSync service by typing 'AppSync' into the search bar and selecting it from the dropdown menu.
3. Once in the AppSync dashboard, you will see a list of your APIs. Click on the name of the API you want to check.
4. In the settings of the selected API, look for the 'Authorization' section. Here, you should see the authorization type and additional authorization providers if any have been configured. If there is no authorization configuration, it indicates a misconfiguration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to list all the available AppSync APIs. You can do this by using the AWS CLI command `list-graphql-apis`. The command is as follows:

```bash
aws appsync list-graphql-apis --region <region-name>
```
Replace `<region-name>` with the name of the AWS region where the APIs are hosted.

2. The output of the above command will give you a list of all the AppSync APIs in the specified region. Each API will have an 'arn' and 'name'. You can use the 'arn' to get more details about each API.

3. Now, for each API, you need to check the authorization configuration. You can do this by using the AWS CLI command `get-graphql-api`. The command is as follows:

```bash
aws appsync get-graphql-api --api-id <api-id> --region <region-name>
```
Replace `<api-id>` with the 'arn' of the API you want to check and `<region-name>` with the name of the AWS region where the API is hosted.

4. The output of the above command will give you details about the specified API. Look for the 'authorizationConfig' field in the output. If this field is missing or not properly configured, then the API does not have proper authorization configuration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): Before you can start writing Python scripts to check AppSync APIs, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials either by setting the following environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN (optional), or by using the AWS CLI command `aws configure`.

2. Import the necessary modules and create an AppSync client: In your Python script, you need to import Boto3 and create an AppSync client. Here's how you can do it:

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('appsync')
   ```

3. List all AppSync APIs and check their authorization configuration: You can use the `list_graphql_apis` method to get a list of all AppSync APIs. Then, for each API, you can use the `get_graphql_api` method to get its details and check its authorization configuration. Here's a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('appsync')

   # List all AppSync APIs
   response = client.list_graphql_apis()

   for api in response['graphqlApis']:
       # Get the details of each API
       api_response = client.get_graphql_api(
           apiId=api['apiId']
       )

       # Check the authorization configuration
       if 'authorizationConfig' not in api_response['graphqlApi']:
           print(f"AppSync API {api['name']} does not have an authorization configuration.")
   ```

4. Handle pagination: The `list_graphql_apis` method returns a maximum of 25 APIs at a time. If you have more APIs, you need to handle pagination by using the `nextToken` parameter. Here's how you can modify the above script to handle pagination:

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('appsync')

   # Initialize the next token
   next_token = None

   while True:
       # List all AppSync APIs
       if next_token:
           response = client.list_graphql_apis(nextToken=next_token)
       else:
           response = client.list_graphql_apis()

       for api in response['graphqlApis']:
           # Get the details of each API
           api_response = client.get_graphql_api(
               apiId=api['apiId']
           )

           # Check the authorization configuration
           if 'authorizationConfig' not in api_response['graphqlApi']:
               print(f"AppSync API {api['name']} does not have an authorization configuration.")

       # If there are more APIs, get the next token, otherwise break the loop
       if 'nextToken' in response:
           next_token = response['nextToken']
       else:
           break
   ```
This script will print the names of all AppSync APIs that do not have an authorization configuration.
