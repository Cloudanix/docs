### More Info:

This rule evaluates the authorization configuration of AWS AppSync APIs to ensure that appropriate access controls are in place. It verifies whether authentication modes such as API key, IAM, or Cognito user pools are properly configured and whether authorization mechanisms such as fine-grained resolver permissions or GraphQL field-level security are implemented to restrict access to sensitive data.

<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of AppSync APIs not having authorization configuration in AWS, you can follow these steps using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to AWS AppSync**: Go to the AWS AppSync service by typing "AppSync" in the search bar and selecting it from the options that appear.

3. **Select your API**: In the AWS AppSync console, select the API that you want to configure authorization for from the list of APIs.

4. **Configure Authorization**: In the API details page, click on the "Settings" tab to configure the authorization settings for your API.

5. **Edit Authorization Settings**: Under the "Authorization mode" section, click on the "Edit" button to modify the authorization settings.

6. **Choose Authorization Type**: In the Edit Authorization dialog box, select the appropriate authorization type based on your requirements. You can choose from API Key, IAM, Cognito User Pool, or OpenID Connect.

7. **Configure Authorization**: Depending on the authorization type you selected, configure the settings accordingly. For example, if you choose Cognito User Pool, you will need to select the User Pool ID and App Client ID.

8. **Save Changes**: After configuring the authorization settings, click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

9. **Test Authorization**: It is recommended to test the authorization settings to ensure that they are working as expected. You can do this by making a test request to your API using the configured authorization method.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of AppSync APIs not having authorization configuration in AWS AppSync using the AWS Management Console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of AppSync APIs not having authorization configuration in AWS using AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **List all the APIs in AppSync:**
    Run the following AWS CLI command to list all the APIs in AppSync:
    ```bash
    aws appsync list-graphql-apis
    ```

2. **Identify the API without authorization configuration:**
    Check the output of the above command and identify the API that does not have authorization configuration set up.

3. **Update the API with authorization configuration:**
    Run the following AWS CLI command to update the API with the required authorization configuration. Replace `<api-id>` with the actual API ID and `<authorization-type>` with the desired authorization type (e.g., API_KEY, AWS_IAM, AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS, OPENID_CONNECT).
    ```bash
    aws appsync update-graphql-api --api-id <api-id> --authenticationType <authorization-type>
    ```

4. **Verify the authorization configuration:**
    Run the following AWS CLI command to verify that the authorization configuration has been successfully updated for the API:
    ```bash
    aws appsync get-graphql-api --api-id <api-id> --query "graphqlApi.authenticationType"
    ```

5. **Test the API with the new authorization configuration:**
    Test the API to ensure that the authorization configuration is working as expected. You may need to update your client applications to provide the required authorization credentials based on the chosen authentication type.

By following these steps, you can successfully remediate the misconfiguration of AppSync APIs not having authorization configuration in AWS using AWS CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of AppSync APIs not having authorization configuration in AWS, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import boto3
```

2. Initialize the AppSync client:
```python
client = boto3.client('appsync')
```

3. List all the existing APIs in your AppSync service:
```python
response = client.list_graph_ql_apis()
```

4. Iterate through the list of APIs and update the authorization configuration for each one:
```python
for api in response['graphQlApis']:
    api_id = api['apiId']
    
    # Update the authorization configuration for the API
    client.update_graph_ql_api(
        apiId=api_id,
        authenticationType='API_KEY',  # You can choose the appropriate authentication type here
        userPoolConfig={
            'userPoolId': 'YOUR_USER_POOL_ID',
            'awsRegion': 'YOUR_AWS_REGION'
        }
    )
```

5. Replace `'YOUR_USER_POOL_ID'` and `'YOUR_AWS_REGION'` with the appropriate values for your setup. You can also choose the appropriate `authenticationType` based on your requirements.

6. Run the Python script to update the authorization configuration for all the APIs in your AppSync service.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of AppSync APIs not having authorization configuration in AWS using Python.
