<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To ensure that encryption at rest is enabled for AWS AppSync cache using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Check Current AppSync API Configuration:**
   First, you need to identify the AppSync API for which you want to enable encryption at rest. Use the following command to list all AppSync APIs and get their IDs.

   ```sh
   aws appsync list-graphql-apis
   ```

2. **Describe the AppSync API:**
   Once you have the API ID, describe the specific AppSync API to check its current configuration.

   ```sh
   aws appsync get-graphql-api --api-id <your-appsync-api-id>
   ```

3. **Update AppSync API to Enable Encryption:**
   If encryption at rest is not enabled, you can update the AppSync API to enable it. Use the following command to update the API configuration. Replace `<your-appsync-api-id>` with your actual API ID and `<kms-key-id>` with your KMS key ID.

   ```sh
   aws appsync update-graphql-api --api-id <your-appsync-api-id> --name <your-api-name> --authentication-type API_KEY --log-config '{"fieldLogLevel": "ALL", "cloudWatchLogsRoleArn": "<your-cloudwatch-logs-role-arn>"}' --user-pool-config '{"userPoolId": "<your-user-pool-id>", "awsRegion": "<your-region>", "defaultAction": "ALLOW"}' --xray-enabled --encryption-at-rest '{"kmsKeyId": "<kms-key-id>"}'
   ```

4. **Verify the Update:**
   Finally, verify that the encryption at rest has been enabled by describing the AppSync API again.

   ```sh
   aws appsync get-graphql-api --api-id <your-appsync-api-id>
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that encryption at rest is enabled for your AWS AppSync cache using the AWS CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To ensure that encryption at rest is enabled for AWS AppSync cache using Python scripts, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Install Boto3**:
   Ensure you have Boto3 installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure your AWS credentials are configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by directly configuring the `~/.aws/credentials` file.

3. **Create a Python Script**:
   Write a Python script to enable encryption at rest for your AppSync cache. Below is an example script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Initialize a session using Amazon AppSync
   session = boto3.Session(
       aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
       aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
       region_name='YOUR_REGION'
   )

   # Initialize the AppSync client
   appsync_client = session.client('appsync')

   # Function to enable encryption at rest for AppSync cache
   def enable_encryption_at_rest(api_id):
       try:
           response = appsync_client.update_api_cache(
               apiId=api_id,
               ttl=3600,  # Time to live in seconds
               type='T2_SMALL',  # Cache instance type
               apiCachingBehavior='FULL_REQUEST_CACHING',  # Caching behavior
               transitEncryptionEnabled=True,  # Enable encryption in transit
               atRestEncryptionEnabled=True  # Enable encryption at rest
           )
           print(f"Encryption at rest enabled for AppSync cache: {response}")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Error enabling encryption at rest: {e}")

   # Replace 'YOUR_API_ID' with your actual AppSync API ID
   enable_encryption_at_rest('YOUR_API_ID')
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to enable encryption at rest for your AppSync cache:
   ```bash
   python enable_encryption.py
   ```

This script initializes a Boto3 session, sets up the AppSync client, and defines a function to update the API cache settings to enable encryption at rest. Make sure to replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'`, `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'`, `'YOUR_REGION'`, and `'YOUR_API_ID'` with your actual AWS credentials, region, and AppSync API ID.

By following these steps, you can ensure that encryption at rest is enabled for your AWS AppSync cache using a Python script.

<Tab title='Cause'>
### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the AppSync service. You can find this by typing 'AppSync' into the search bar at the top of the console.
3. In the AppSync dashboard, select the APIs from the navigation pane.
4. For each API, click on its name to open its details page. In the details page, click on 'Settings' in the left-hand navigation pane.
5. In the Settings page, look for the 'Cache' section. If the 'Encryption at Rest' field is set to 'Disabled', then Encryption at Rest is not enabled for the App Sync Cache.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by AWS. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the AppSync resources.

2. Once the AWS CLI is set up, you can use the following command to list all the AppSync APIs in your account:

   ```
   aws appsync list-graphql-apis --region your-region
   ```

   Replace 'your-region' with the region where your resources are located. This command will return a list of all the AppSync APIs in the specified region.

3. To check the encryption at rest configuration for each API, you can use the following command:

   ```
   aws appsync get-graphql-api --api-id your-api-id --region your-region
   ```

   Replace 'your-api-id' with the ID of the API you want to check and 'your-region' with the region where the API is located. This command will return the details of the specified API, including the encryption at rest configuration.

4. To check if encryption at rest is enabled, you need to look at the 'userPoolConfig' field in the output. If the 'awsCognitoUserPools' field is set to 'true', then encryption at rest is enabled. If it's set to 'false' or not present, then encryption at rest is not enabled. 

   Note: The 'awsCognitoUserPools' field might not be present if the API is not using AWS Cognito User Pools for authorization. In this case, you need to check the 'authorizationConfig' field to see if encryption at rest is enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if Encryption At Rest is enabled for App Sync Cache in AWS App Sync, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Set up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
   ```

2. **Import Boto3 and Initialize AppSync Client:**
   Now, you can import Boto3 in your Python script and initialize the AppSync client.

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('appsync')
   ```

3. **List AppSync APIs and Check Encryption Configuration:**
   You can use the `list_graphql_apis` method to get a list of all AppSync APIs. Then, for each API, you can check the `xrayEnabled` attribute in the `logConfig` field to see if Encryption At Rest is enabled.

   ```python
   response = client.list_graphql_apis()

   for api in response['graphqlApis']:
       if 'logConfig' in api and 'xrayEnabled' in api['logConfig']:
           if api['logConfig']['xrayEnabled']:
               print(f"Encryption At Rest is enabled for {api['name']}")
           else:
               print(f"Encryption At Rest is not enabled for {api['name']}")
   ```

4. **Handle Pagination:**
   The `list_graphql_apis` method returns a maximum of 25 APIs at a time. If you have more than 25 APIs, you need to handle pagination by using the `nextToken` parameter.

   ```python
   next_token = None

   while True:
       if next_token:
           response = client.list_graphql_apis(nextToken=next_token)
       else:
           response = client.list_graphql_apis()

       for api in response['graphqlApis']:
           if 'logConfig' in api and 'xrayEnabled' in api['logConfig']:
               if api['logConfig']['xrayEnabled']:
                   print(f"Encryption At Rest is enabled for {api['name']}")
               else:
                   print(f"Encryption At Rest is not enabled for {api['name']}")

       if 'nextToken' in response:
           next_token = response['nextToken']
       else:
           break
   ```

Please note that this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to list and describe AppSync APIs. If you don't, you may need to adjust your IAM policies accordingly.
