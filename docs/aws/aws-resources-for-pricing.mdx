## Resources which determine your pricing

AWS offers several services. Cloudanix monitors many of these services. However, we do not consider all of them to determine your Cloudanix pricing. Infact, we only use a subset of these services to generate your Cloudanix invoice.

The below table lists all the AWS services which makes up your Cloudanix invoice.

| Resource Name | Unit         | Notes                                    |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| EC2           | Per instance | Count of the nodes. Size doesn't matter. |
| Lambda        | Per function | No dependency on invocations.            |
| S3            | Per bucket   | Count of the buckets                     |
| KMS           | Per key      | Count of the keys                        |
| RDS           | Per node     | Count of the nodes. Size doesn't matter. |
| DynamoDB      | Per db       | Count of databases.                                        |

## How do we count your resources?

We continuously monitor the resources and record the max during the month. At the end of the month, your invoice will be generated accordingly.

## An example

Let's say you got 20 EC2, 50 Lambda, 20 S3 and 4 RDS. Then your pricing per month will be

(20+50+20+4) = 94 \* 0.99 (for Growth plan) = $93.06 per month

We simply add the count of these resources. It doesn't matter the number of your Lambda invocations or the size of your EC2 servers. They are a single unit and gets added up in the count.

## Additional FAQ

There is an FAQ available on the [Pricing Page](https://www.cloudanix.com/pricing?ref=aws-resources-for-pricing) which answer the popular pricing related questions. Below FAQ covers AWS specific queries.

### What about Spot instances?

No, they are not counted.

### What about other resources like VPC, SQS etc?

We monitor them but we do not use them towards your pricing. They are free.
