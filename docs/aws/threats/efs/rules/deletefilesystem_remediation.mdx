### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteFileSystem event in AWS Real-time for EFS refers to the deletion of a file system in Amazon Elastic File System (EFS).
- When this event occurs, it indicates that a specific EFS file system has been deleted, and all associated data and metadata have been permanently removed.
- This event can be useful for monitoring and auditing purposes, allowing administrators to track when and by whom a file system was deleted, and to ensure compliance with data retention policies.

#### Example

1. Possible Impact: If the DeleteFileSystem event in AWS Real-Time for EFS is compromised, it can lead to unauthorized deletion of the file system, resulting in data loss and potential security breaches.

Remediation:
- Enable AWS CloudTrail: By enabling CloudTrail, you can capture all API calls made to EFS, including the DeleteFileSystem event. This will provide an audit trail and help in identifying any unauthorized or malicious activities.
- Implement IAM Policies: Ensure that proper IAM policies are in place to restrict access to the DeleteFileSystem API. Only authorized users or roles should have the necessary permissions to perform this action.
- Enable MFA Delete: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Delete for EFS file systems. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring an additional authentication factor (such as a physical token or virtual MFA device) before allowing the deletion of the file system.

Example CLI Command for enabling MFA Delete:
```
aws efs put-file-system-policy --file-system-id <file-system-id> --policy "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"DenyDeleteWithoutMFA\",\"Effect\":\"Deny\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"*\"},\"Action\":[\"elasticfilesystem:DeleteFileSystem\"],\"Condition\":{\"Bool\":{\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\":\"false\"}}}]}"
```

Note: Replace `<file-system-id>` with the actual ID of the EFS file system.

2. Possible Impact: If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the AWS account or the EFS service, they can potentially execute the DeleteFileSystem event, leading to the deletion of critical file systems.

Remediation:
- Implement Strong Access Controls: Ensure that proper access controls are in place for the AWS account and EFS service. Use strong passwords, enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA), and regularly rotate access keys and credentials.
- Regularly Monitor and Review Logs: Continuously monitor and review logs from AWS CloudTrail, AWS CloudWatch, and other relevant sources to detect any suspicious activities related to the DeleteFileSystem event. Set up alerts and notifications for any unauthorized access attempts.
- Implement Data Backup and Disaster Recovery: Regularly backup your EFS file systems and implement a disaster recovery plan. This will help in quickly restoring the data in case of accidental or malicious deletion.

3. Possible Impact: If the DeleteFileSystem event is triggered without proper validation or authorization, it can result in the deletion of critical file systems, leading to data loss and service disruption.

Remediation:
- Implement Least Privilege Principle: Follow the principle of least privilege and ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to perform the DeleteFileSystem action. Regularly review and update IAM policies to remove unnecessary privileges.
- Enable Versioning: Enable versioning for your EFS file systems. This will allow you to recover previous versions of files in case of accidental deletion.
- Implement Change Management Processes: Implement strict change management processes to ensure that any changes to EFS file systems, including deletions, are properly authorized, documented, and reviewed before execution. This will help prevent unauthorized or accidental deletions.
