### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The AddPermission event in AWS Lambda refers to an action taken to grant permission to another AWS service or entity to invoke a Lambda function.
- This event is triggered when a new permission is added to a Lambda function's resource policy, allowing a specific AWS service or entity to invoke the function.
- The AddPermission event is useful for tracking and auditing changes made to the permissions of a Lambda function, ensuring that only authorized services or entities can invoke the function.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS Management Console or API credentials and performs an AddPermission event on a Lambda function, they can potentially grant excessive permissions to the function. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or even the execution of malicious code within the Lambda function.

Remediation:
- Rotate and secure AWS credentials: Immediately revoke any compromised credentials and rotate all access keys, passwords, and session tokens associated with the affected user or role.
- Implement least privilege access: Review and modify the IAM policies associated with the Lambda function to ensure that only necessary permissions are granted. Follow the principle of least privilege to restrict access to only the required resources and actions.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail: Enable CloudTrail to capture all API calls made to the Lambda function. This will help in identifying the unauthorized AddPermission event and provide an audit trail for investigation.

AWS CLI command to revoke access key:
```
aws iam delete-access-key --user-name <username> --access-key-id <access-key-id>
```

AWS CLI command to modify IAM policy:
```
aws iam put-role-policy --role-name <role-name> --policy-name <policy-name> --policy-document file://policy.json
```

2. Example of security impact: If a Lambda function is misconfigured and allows public access, an attacker can potentially invoke the AddPermission event to grant permissions to their own AWS account or a malicious entity. This can result in unauthorized execution of the Lambda function or unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Remediation:
- Restrict access to the Lambda function: Modify the function's configuration to ensure that it is not publicly accessible. Update the function's VPC settings, security groups, or network ACLs to restrict access to trusted sources only.
- Implement AWS WAF: Use AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to add an additional layer of protection. Configure WAF rules to block requests that are attempting to invoke the Lambda function from unauthorized sources.
- Regularly review and monitor permissions: Regularly review the permissions granted to the Lambda function and remove any unnecessary or excessive permissions. Implement a monitoring solution to detect and alert on any unauthorized AddPermission events.

AWS CLI command to update Lambda function's VPC settings:
```
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <function-name> --vpc-config SubnetIds=<subnet-ids>,SecurityGroupIds=<security-group-ids>
```

AWS CLI command to add AWS WAF rule:
```
aws wafv2 create-rule-group --name <rule-group-name> --scope REGIONAL --capacity <capacity> --rules file://rules.json
```

3. Example of security impact: If an attacker gains access to the AWS account or IAM user with sufficient privileges, they can perform an AddPermission event on a Lambda function to grant permissions to their own AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role. This can lead to privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to perform unauthorized actions or access sensitive resources.

Remediation:
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA for all IAM users and roles with administrative privileges. This adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access.
- Regularly review IAM policies: Regularly review and audit the IAM policies associated with the Lambda function. Remove any unnecessary or overly permissive policies and ensure that the principle of least privilege is followed.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config: Enable CloudTrail and AWS Config to capture and monitor all API calls made to the Lambda function. This will help in detecting and investigating any unauthorized AddPermission events and provide a comprehensive audit trail.

AWS CLI command to enable MFA for an IAM user:
```
aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <user-name> --serial-number <mfa-serial-number> --authentication-code1 <code1> --authentication-code2 <code2>
```

AWS CLI command to enable CloudTrail:
```
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <trail-name> --s3-bucket-name <bucket-name> --is-multi-region-trail --include-global-service-events
```

AWS CLI command to enable AWS Config:
```
aws configservice put-configuration-recorder --configuration-recorder name=default --recording-group allSupported=true --resource-types all
```
