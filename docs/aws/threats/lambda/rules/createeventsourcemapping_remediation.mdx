### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The CreateEventSourceMapping event in AWS Lambda refers to the process of creating a mapping between an event source and a Lambda function.
- This event is triggered when a new event source, such as an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon Kinesis stream, is configured to invoke a specific Lambda function.
- The CreateEventSourceMapping event allows you to define the source of events that will trigger the Lambda function, and specify any additional configuration settings, such as batch size or starting position in the event stream.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with CreateEventSourceMapping in AWS Lambda, it could potentially allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources. For instance, if an attacker gains access to the AWS account and creates a malicious event source mapping, they could potentially execute arbitrary code or access sensitive information.

- Remediation Steps using AWS Console:
  1. Identify the impacted Lambda function: Go to the AWS Lambda console and navigate to the "Functions" page. Identify the Lambda function associated with the event source mapping that is causing the security issue.
  2. Disable the event source mapping: Select the Lambda function and click on the "Event source mappings" tab. Locate the specific event source mapping that needs to be remediated and click on it.
  3. Disable the event source mapping: In the event source mapping details page, click on the "Disable" button to stop the Lambda function from processing events from that particular source.

Note: It is important to investigate the root cause of the security impact and take appropriate actions to prevent similar incidents in the future. This may involve reviewing access controls, monitoring/logging configurations, and implementing security best practices for AWS Lambda functions.

#### Using CLI

- One example of how security can be impacted with CreateEventSourceMapping in AWS Lambda is if the event source mapping is misconfigured and allows unauthorized access to the Lambda function. This can potentially lead to unauthorized execution of the Lambda function or exposure of sensitive data.

To remediate this issue for AWS Lambda using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the misconfigured event source mapping by checking the existing mappings for the Lambda function. You can use the following AWS CLI command to list all the event source mappings for a specific Lambda function:

   ```
   aws lambda list-event-source-mappings --function-name <lambda-function-name>
   ```

2. Once you have identified the misconfigured event source mapping, you can delete it using the following AWS CLI command:

   ```
   aws lambda delete-event-source-mapping --uuid <event-source-mapping-uuid>
   ```

   Replace `<event-source-mapping-uuid>` with the UUID of the event source mapping that needs to be deleted.

3. After deleting the misconfigured event source mapping, you can create a new one with the correct configuration using the following AWS CLI command:

   ```
   aws lambda create-event-source-mapping --function-name <lambda-function-name> --event-source-arn <event-source-arn> --starting-position <starting-position>
   ```

   Replace `<lambda-function-name>` with the name of the Lambda function, `<event-source-arn>` with the ARN of the event source (e.g., Kinesis stream, DynamoDB table, etc.), and `<starting-position>` with the desired starting position for the event source mapping (e.g., LATEST, TRIM_HORIZON, etc.).

By following these steps, you can remediate security issues related to misconfigured event source mappings in AWS Lambda using AWS CLI.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with CreateEventSourceMapping in AWS Lambda:
   - If the IAM role associated with the Lambda function has overly permissive permissions, an attacker could potentially abuse the CreateEventSourceMapping API to create mappings for event sources that the Lambda function should not have access to. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources.

2. Remediation for AWS Lambda using Python:
   - To remediate this security issue, you can implement proper access controls and permissions for the IAM role associated with the Lambda function. Here's an example Python script that demonstrates how to create a secure CreateEventSourceMapping:

```python
import boto3

def create_event_source_mapping(lambda_function_name, event_source_arn):
    client = boto3.client('lambda')
    
    response = client.create_event_source_mapping(
        FunctionName=lambda_function_name,
        EventSourceArn=event_source_arn,
        BatchSize=10,
        StartingPosition='LATEST'
    )
    
    return response['UUID']

# Usage example
lambda_function_name = 'my-lambda-function'
event_source_arn = 'arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:123456789012:my-queue'
event_source_mapping_uuid = create_event_source_mapping(lambda_function_name, event_source_arn)
print(f"Event source mapping UUID: {event_source_mapping_uuid}")
```

   - In this example, the script uses the `boto3` library to create an event source mapping for an SQS queue. Make sure to replace `my-lambda-function` with the actual name of your Lambda function and `arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:123456789012:my-queue` with the ARN of your desired event source.

3. Additional security best practices:
   - Regularly review and update the IAM role permissions associated with the Lambda function to ensure they are least privileged.
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log API calls related to Lambda function event source mappings for auditing and security analysis.
