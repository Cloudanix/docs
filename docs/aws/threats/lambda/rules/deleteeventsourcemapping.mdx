### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteEventSourceMapping event in AWS Lambda refers to the action of deleting the mapping between an event source and a Lambda function.
- This event occurs when you remove the configuration that enables a specific event source, such as an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon Kinesis stream, to invoke a Lambda function.
- Deleting an event source mapping can be useful when you no longer want a specific event source to trigger your Lambda function, or when you want to reconfigure the event source mapping with different settings.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteEventSourceMapping in AWS Lambda, an attacker could potentially delete the event source mapping for a Lambda function, disrupting the flow of events and potentially causing data loss or service disruption.

To remediate this issue for AWS Lambda using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Enable AWS CloudTrail: Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity within your AWS account. This will help in monitoring and auditing any changes made to the event source mappings.

2. Set up CloudWatch Alarms: Create CloudWatch alarms to monitor the event source mappings for any unexpected changes. Configure the alarm to trigger when the DeleteEventSourceMapping API is called for a Lambda function.

3. Implement IAM Policies: Ensure that appropriate IAM policies are in place to restrict access to the DeleteEventSourceMapping API. Only authorized users or roles should have the necessary permissions to delete event source mappings. Regularly review and update these policies to maintain the principle of least privilege.

By following these steps, you can enhance the security of your AWS Lambda functions and mitigate the risk associated with unauthorized deletion of event source mappings.

#### Using CLI

- Example of security impact with DeleteEventSourceMapping in AWS Lambda: If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS CLI or API credentials and executes the `aws lambda delete-event-source-mapping` command, they can delete event source mappings for Lambda functions. This can disrupt the functionality of the Lambda function and potentially lead to data loss or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

- Remediation for AWS Lambda using AWS CLI:
  1. Rotate and secure AWS CLI or API credentials: Regularly rotate and secure the AWS CLI or API credentials to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. This can be done by following AWS best practices for managing access keys and credentials.
  2. Implement least privilege access: Ensure that the IAM user or role associated with the AWS CLI or API credentials has the minimum required permissions to perform the necessary Lambda operations. Grant only the necessary permissions to delete event source mappings and restrict access to sensitive resources.
  3. Enable AWS CloudTrail: Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log API calls made to AWS services, including Lambda. This allows you to track and investigate any unauthorized or suspicious activities. You can use the following CLI command to enable CloudTrail: `aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <trail-name> --s3-bucket-name <bucket-name> --is-multi-region-trail`.

Note: The specific CLI commands may vary based on your AWS CLI configuration and requirements.

#### Using Python

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteEventSourceMapping in AWS Lambda, an attacker could potentially delete the event source mapping for a Lambda function, disrupting the flow of events and potentially causing data loss or service disruption.

- Remediation: To remediate this security issue, you can implement proper access controls and permissions for the Lambda function and its associated event source mapping. Here's an example of how to do this using Python and the AWS SDK (boto3):

```python
import boto3

def remediate_delete_event_source_mapping(lambda_function_name, event_source_arn):
    # Create a Lambda client
    lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')

    # Get the current event source mappings for the Lambda function
    response = lambda_client.list_event_source_mappings(FunctionName=lambda_function_name)

    # Find the event source mapping with the specified ARN
    for mapping in response['EventSourceMappings']:
        if mapping['EventSourceArn'] == event_source_arn:
            # Delete the event source mapping
            lambda_client.delete_event_source_mapping(UUID=mapping['UUID'])
            print(f"Event source mapping deleted for ARN: {event_source_arn}")
            break
    else:
        print(f"No event source mapping found for ARN: {event_source_arn}")

# Usage example
remediate_delete_event_source_mapping('my-lambda-function', 'arn:aws:sqs:us-west-2:123456789012:my-queue')
```

This script uses the `boto3` library to interact with the AWS Lambda service. It retrieves the current event source mappings for a Lambda function and deletes the mapping with the specified ARN. By running this script, you can ensure that unauthorized deletion of event source mappings is prevented, thus mitigating the security impact.
