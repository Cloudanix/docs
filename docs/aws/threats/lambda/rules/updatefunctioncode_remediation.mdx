### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The UpdateFunctionCode event in AWS Lambda refers to an event that is triggered when the code of a Lambda function is updated or modified.
- This event is typically used to track changes made to the code of a Lambda function, allowing developers to monitor and analyze any updates or modifications made to the function.
- By capturing and analyzing the UpdateFunctionCode event, developers can gain insights into the versioning and deployment history of their Lambda functions, helping them to troubleshoot issues and maintain a clear audit trail of code changes.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the AWS Lambda function code during an UpdateFunctionCode event, they could potentially modify the code to introduce malicious logic or extract sensitive information. This could lead to unauthorized data access, data leakage, or even a complete compromise of the application or system.

Remediation:
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API calls made to AWS Lambda. This will help in identifying any unauthorized or suspicious activities.
- Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to the Lambda function code. Only authorized users or roles should have the necessary permissions to modify the code.
- Regularly review and update the IAM policies to ensure that access to the Lambda function code is granted on a need-to-know basis.
- Enable AWS Lambda function versioning and aliases. This allows you to maintain multiple versions of the function code and easily roll back to a previous version in case of any security issues.

Example CLI command to enable CloudTrail for AWS Lambda:
```
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name lambda-trail --s3-bucket-name <bucket-name> --is-multi-region-trail
```

Example CLI command to update IAM policy for Lambda function:
```
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <function-name> --statement-id <statement-id> --action <action> --principal <principal> --source-arn <source-arn>
```

Note: Replace `<bucket-name>`, `<function-name>`, `<statement-id>`, `<action>`, `<principal>`, and `<source-arn>` with the appropriate values specific to your environment.
