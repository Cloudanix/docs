### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The RemovePermission event in AWS Lambda refers to the action of removing a permission from a Lambda function.
- When this event occurs, it means that a previously granted permission for a specific resource or service to invoke the Lambda function has been revoked.
- This event is typically triggered when an administrator or developer decides to restrict access to the Lambda function by removing the permission previously granted to a particular entity.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: 
   - If an unauthorized user or malicious actor triggers a RemovePermission event in AWS Lambda, they can potentially remove a permission that grants access to sensitive resources or actions within the Lambda function. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or disruption of critical services.

2. Remediation:
   - Implement least privilege access control: Ensure that only necessary permissions are granted to the Lambda function and its associated resources. Follow the principle of least privilege by granting only the minimum required permissions to perform specific actions.
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail: Enable CloudTrail to monitor and log all API calls made to the Lambda function. This will help in identifying any unauthorized or suspicious RemovePermission events.
   - Regularly review and audit permissions: Conduct regular reviews of the permissions assigned to Lambda functions and associated IAM roles. Remove any unnecessary or excessive permissions to minimize the attack surface.
   - Implement IAM policies and roles: Use IAM policies and roles to control access to Lambda functions. Assign appropriate permissions to users, groups, or roles based on the principle of least privilege.
   - Enable AWS Config: Enable AWS Config to continuously monitor and evaluate the configuration of your Lambda functions. This can help detect any unauthorized changes to permissions or configurations.

Example CLI command to add permission to a Lambda function:
```
aws lambda add-permission --function-name <function-name> --statement-id <statement-id> --action <action> --principal <principal> --source-arn <source-arn>
```

Example CLI command to remove permission from a Lambda function:
```
aws lambda remove-permission --function-name <function-name> --statement-id <statement-id>
```

Note: Replace `<function-name>`, `<statement-id>`, `<action>`, `<principal>`, and `<source-arn>` with the appropriate values for your specific use case.
