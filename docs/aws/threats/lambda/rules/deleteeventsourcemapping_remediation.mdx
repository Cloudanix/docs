### Event Information

- The DeleteEventSourceMapping event in AWS Lambda refers to the action of deleting the mapping between an event source and a Lambda function.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process deletes the configuration that connects an event source, such as an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon Kinesis stream, to a specific Lambda function.
- When this event occurs, the Lambda function will no longer be invoked in response to events from the deleted event source.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the AWS account or the IAM role associated with the Lambda function, they can potentially delete the event source mapping. This can disrupt the normal functioning of the Lambda function and impact the security of the system.

2. Denial of Service (DoS): Malicious actors can intentionally delete event source mappings for critical Lambda functions, causing a denial of service attack. This can result in the unavailability of important services or applications relying on the Lambda function.

3. Data loss or exposure: If a Lambda function is triggered by an event source mapping that is deleted, any data associated with that event may be lost or left unprocessed. This can lead to data loss or exposure, depending on the nature of the event and the data being processed by the Lambda function. It is important to have proper backup and recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate such risks.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized deletion:
- Regularly review and monitor the AWS account and IAM roles associated with the Lambda function to detect any unauthorized access.
- Implement strong access control measures, such as using IAM policies and roles with least privilege principles, to limit access to the Lambda function and event source mappings.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity and monitor for any suspicious or unauthorized deletion attempts.

2. Denial of Service (DoS):
- Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to event source mappings and prevent unauthorized deletion.
- Enable AWS CloudWatch alarms to monitor the status of event source mappings and trigger notifications or automated actions in case of deletion.
- Regularly backup event source mappings and Lambda function configurations to quickly restore them in case of deletion.

3. Data loss or exposure:
- Implement a backup and recovery strategy for the data processed by the Lambda function, such as using AWS S3 for storing backups or implementing data replication mechanisms.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity related to event source mappings and Lambda functions, allowing for auditing and investigation in case of data loss or exposure.
- Regularly test the backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure they are functioning properly and can be relied upon in case of event source mapping deletion.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion:
- Regularly monitor and review IAM roles and permissions associated with the Lambda function to ensure that only authorized users have access.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to track and log all API calls related to the Lambda function, including event source mapping deletions.
- Implement least privilege principles by granting only the necessary permissions to the IAM roles associated with the Lambda function.

2. Denial of Service (DoS):
- Enable AWS CloudWatch alarms to monitor the event source mapping status and trigger notifications or automated actions in case of deletion.
- Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to event source mappings and prevent unauthorized deletions.
- Regularly backup event source mappings and consider implementing a disaster recovery plan to quickly restore critical mappings in case of deletion.

3. Data loss or exposure:
- Implement a backup mechanism for the data associated with the event source mapping, such as storing it in a durable storage service like Amazon S3.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to track and log all API calls related to the event source mapping, including deletions, to detect and investigate any potential data loss or exposure.
- Implement proper error handling and retries in the Lambda function code to handle cases where the event source mapping is deleted or unavailable temporarily.

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized deletion:
- Implement strong access controls and least privilege principles for AWS accounts and IAM roles associated with Lambda functions.
- Regularly monitor and review access logs and CloudTrail logs to detect any unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to track and log all API calls made to the Lambda function and event source mappings. 

2. Denial of Service (DoS):
- Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to event source mappings and prevent unauthorized deletion.
- Enable AWS CloudWatch alarms to monitor the number of event source mapping deletions and set up notifications for any unexpected changes.
- Implement AWS Shield or other DDoS protection services to mitigate and prevent DoS attacks.

3. Data loss or exposure:
- Implement a backup and recovery strategy for the data processed by the Lambda function, such as storing data in durable storage like Amazon S3 or a database.
- Implement retries and error handling mechanisms in the Lambda function code to handle cases where event source mappings are deleted.
- Regularly test and validate the backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity and availability.
