### Event Information

- The DeleteEventSourceMapping event in AWS Lambda refers to the action of deleting the mapping between an event source and a Lambda function.
- This event occurs when you remove the configuration that enables a specific event source, such as an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon Kinesis stream, to invoke a Lambda function.
- Deleting an event source mapping effectively stops the Lambda function from being triggered by events from that particular source.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the AWS account or the IAM role associated with the Lambda function, they can potentially delete the event source mapping. This can disrupt the normal functioning of the Lambda function and impact the security of the system.

2. Denial of Service (DoS): Malicious actors can intentionally delete event source mappings for critical Lambda functions, causing a denial of service attack. This can result in the unavailability of important services or applications relying on the Lambda function.

3. Data loss or exposure: If a Lambda function is triggered by an event source mapping that is deleted, any data associated with that event may be lost or left unprocessed. This can lead to data loss or exposure, depending on the nature of the event and the data being processed by the Lambda function. It is important to have proper backup and recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate such risks.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized deletion: To mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of event source mappings for AWS Lambda functions using the AWS console, follow these steps:

- Implement strong access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have access to the AWS account and the IAM role associated with the Lambda function. Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create and manage user accounts, groups, and roles. Grant least privilege access to users, assigning only the necessary permissions required for their tasks.

- Regularly monitor and audit the AWS account: Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity and log events related to the Lambda function and event source mappings. Monitor the CloudTrail logs for any suspicious or unauthorized activities. Regularly review and analyze the logs to identify any potential security issues.

- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users: Enable MFA for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security. This ensures that even if an attacker gains access to IAM credentials, they would still need the additional factor (such as a physical token or a mobile app) to authenticate.

2. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: To prevent DoS attacks targeting event source mappings for AWS Lambda functions, consider the following steps:

- Implement rate limiting: Configure AWS Lambda function concurrency limits to control the number of simultaneous function invocations. This helps prevent overwhelming the system with excessive event source mapping creations and deletions.

- Implement AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall): Use AWS WAF to protect the API Gateway or other entry points that trigger the Lambda function. Configure WAF rules to detect and block suspicious or malicious requests that could be part of a DoS attack.

- Monitor and analyze CloudWatch metrics: Utilize CloudWatch metrics to monitor the number of event source mapping creations and deletions. Set up alarms to notify you when there is a sudden increase in these activities, which could indicate a potential DoS attack.

3. Data loss or exposure: To mitigate the risk of data loss or exposure due to deleted event source mappings for AWS Lambda functions, consider the following steps:

- Implement backup and disaster recovery plans: Regularly back up the data processed by the Lambda function and store it in a secure location. This ensures that even if the event source mapping is deleted, the data can be recovered and processed later.

- Enable AWS Lambda Dead Letter Queues (DLQ): Configure a DLQ for the Lambda function to capture and store any failed event processing. This helps prevent data loss in case the event source mapping is deleted and ensures that failed events can be retried or analyzed later.

- Implement data encryption: If the Lambda function handles sensitive or critical data, enable encryption for the data at rest and in transit. Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage and control the encryption keys.

Note: These steps provide general guidance for mitigating the security impacts related to unauthorized deletion, DoS attacks, and data loss or exposure. It is important to assess your specific requirements and consult AWS documentation for detailed instructions on implementing these measures using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of event source mappings for AWS Lambda using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

- Implement strong access controls: Ensure that IAM roles and policies are properly configured to restrict access to the AWS account and Lambda functions. Use the principle of least privilege to grant only the necessary permissions to users and roles.

- Regularly monitor and audit the AWS account: Set up CloudTrail to capture API activity logs and enable logging for Lambda functions. Regularly review the logs to detect any unauthorized access or deletion attempts.

- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users: Enforce the use of MFA for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security. This helps prevent unauthorized access to the AWS account and reduces the risk of deletion.

2. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: To mitigate DoS attacks targeting event source mappings for AWS Lambda, you can take the following steps:

- Implement rate limiting: Configure AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to set rate limits on API calls related to event source mappings. This helps prevent excessive requests and protects against DoS attacks.

- Monitor and analyze API activity: Utilize CloudWatch to monitor API activity and set up alarms for abnormal behavior. This allows you to detect and respond to DoS attacks in real-time.

- Implement AWS Shield: Enable AWS Shield, a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service, to provide additional protection against DoS attacks. AWS Shield helps to automatically detect and mitigate large-scale attacks.

3. Data loss or exposure: To prevent data loss or exposure due to the deletion of event source mappings for AWS Lambda, consider the following measures:

- Regularly backup Lambda functions: Implement a backup strategy to regularly create snapshots or backups of Lambda functions. This ensures that even if an event source mapping is deleted, you can restore it from a backup and minimize data loss.

- Implement data encryption: Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt sensitive data processed by Lambda functions. This adds an extra layer of protection and prevents unauthorized access to the data in case of a security incident.

- Implement data replication: Utilize AWS services like Amazon S3 or Amazon RDS to replicate data across multiple regions or availability zones. This helps ensure data availability and reduces the risk of data loss in case of a failure or deletion of event source mappings.

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized deletion: To mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of event source mappings in AWS Lambda, you can implement the following steps using Python:

- Implement strong access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to modify or delete event source mappings. You can use the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service to manage access controls. Here's an example of how to create an IAM policy that allows only specific users to modify or delete event source mappings:

```python
import boto3

iam = boto3.client('iam')

policy_document = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "lambda:DeleteEventSourceMapping",
                "lambda:UpdateEventSourceMapping"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:<region>:<account-id>:event-source-mapping:<mapping-id>"
        }
    ]
}

response = iam.create_policy(
    PolicyName='LambdaEventSourceMappingPolicy',
    PolicyDocument=json.dumps(policy_document)
)
```

- Regularly monitor and audit the AWS account: Implement a monitoring and auditing solution to detect any unauthorized access or modifications to event source mappings. You can use AWS CloudTrail to capture API calls related to Lambda event source mappings and set up alerts or notifications for any suspicious activities.

- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users: By enabling MFA, you add an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access to IAM users' accounts. This helps protect against potential attacks that could lead to unauthorized deletion of event source mappings. You can use the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI to enable MFA for IAM users.

2. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: To mitigate the risk of DoS attacks targeting event source mappings in AWS Lambda, you can implement the following steps using Python:

- Implement rate limiting: Configure rate limits for creating or updating event source mappings to prevent excessive requests from overwhelming the system. You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to set rate limits for Lambda API calls. Here's an example of how to set a rate limit for creating event source mappings:

```python
import boto3

lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')

response = lambda_client.put_function_event_invoke_config(
    FunctionName='my-lambda-function',
    MaximumEventAgeInSeconds=300,
    MaximumRetryAttempts=0,
    MaximumRetryAttemptsEventAgeInSeconds=7200,
    DestinationConfig={
        'OnSuccess': {
            'Destination': 'arn:aws:lambda:<region>:<account-id>:function:<success-function-name>'
        },
        'OnFailure': {
            'Destination': 'arn:aws:lambda:<region>:<account-id>:function:<failure-function-name>'
        }
    }
)
```

- Implement anomaly detection: Monitor the creation and deletion of event source mappings for any unusual patterns or spikes in activity. You can use AWS CloudWatch to collect and analyze metrics related to Lambda event source mappings. Set up alarms or notifications to alert you when abnormal activity is detected.

- Implement AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall): Use AWS WAF to protect against common DoS attack patterns, such as excessive requests or IP-based rate limiting. Configure AWS WAF rules to filter out malicious traffic targeting event source mappings.

3. Data loss or exposure: To mitigate the risk of data loss or exposure due to deleted event source mappings in AWS Lambda, you can implement the following steps using Python:

- Implement backup and restore mechanisms: Regularly back up your Lambda functions and event source mappings to a secure location. You can use AWS Lambda's export functionality to export the configuration of your Lambda functions, including event source mappings. Here's an example of how to export the configuration of a Lambda function:

```python
import boto3

lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')

response = lambda_client.get_function(
    FunctionName='my-lambda-function'
)

with open('lambda_function_config.json', 'w') as file:
    file.write(json.dumps(response['Configuration']))
```

- Implement disaster recovery plans: Have a well-defined disaster recovery plan in place to quickly restore event source mappings in case of accidental deletion or system failures. Regularly test the recovery process to ensure its effectiveness.

- Implement data encryption: Encrypt sensitive or critical data before passing it to Lambda functions. You can use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage encryption keys and encrypt data at rest or in transit. Ensure that the event source mappings are configured to handle encrypted data appropriately.
