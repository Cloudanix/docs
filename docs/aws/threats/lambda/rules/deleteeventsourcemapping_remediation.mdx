### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteEventSourceMapping event in AWS Lambda refers to the action of deleting an event source mapping for a Lambda function.
- Event source mappings are configurations that define the event source (such as an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon Kinesis stream) and the Lambda function that should be triggered when an event occurs in that source.
- When a DeleteEventSourceMapping event occurs, it means that the event source mapping for a specific Lambda function has been removed, and the Lambda function will no longer be triggered by events from that source.

#### Example

- Example: If the security is impacted with a DeleteEventSourceMapping event in AWS Lambda, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access or disruption of the Lambda function's event source mapping. An attacker with sufficient permissions could delete the event source mapping, effectively severing the connection between the event source and the Lambda function.

- Remediation:
  1. Implement least privilege access control: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete event source mappings. Follow the principle of least privilege and regularly review and update permissions to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
  2. Enable CloudTrail logging: Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity and monitor for any unauthorized or suspicious DeleteEventSourceMapping events. This will provide visibility into the actions performed on event source mappings and help in identifying potential security incidents.
  3. Implement automated backups: Regularly back up your Lambda function configurations, including event source mappings, using AWS Lambda's export functionality or by using AWS CloudFormation. This will allow you to quickly restore event source mappings in case of accidental deletion or security incidents.

- AWS CLI command to list event source mappings:
  ```
  aws lambda list-event-source-mappings --function-name <lambda-function-name>
  ```

- AWS CLI command to delete an event source mapping:
  ```
  aws lambda delete-event-source-mapping --uuid <event-source-mapping-uuid>
  ```
