### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The CreateEventSourceMapping event in AWS Lambda refers to the process of creating a mapping between an event source and a Lambda function.
- This event is triggered when a new event source, such as an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon Kinesis stream, is configured to invoke a specific Lambda function.
- The CreateEventSourceMapping event allows you to define the source of events that will trigger the Lambda function, and specify any additional configuration settings, such as batch size or starting position in the event stream.

#### Example

- One possible way security can be impacted with the CreateEventSourceMapping event in AWS Lambda is if the event source mapping is misconfigured, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources. For example, if the event source mapping is set to listen to an S3 bucket, but the bucket permissions are not properly restricted, an attacker could potentially upload malicious files or access sensitive data within the bucket.

Remediation:
1. Ensure that the event source mapping is properly configured to only listen to authorized event sources. For example, if using an S3 bucket as the event source, make sure the bucket permissions are properly restricted to prevent unauthorized access.
2. Regularly review and audit the event source mappings to ensure they are still necessary and properly configured. Remove any unnecessary or misconfigured mappings.
3. Implement AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API calls related to event source mappings. This will help in detecting any unauthorized or suspicious activity.

AWS CLI command to create an event source mapping for a Lambda function:
```
aws lambda create-event-source-mapping --function-name <lambda-function-name> --batch-size <batch-size> --starting-position <starting-position> --event-source-arn <event-source-arn>
```

Note: Replace `<lambda-function-name>`, `<batch-size>`, `<starting-position>`, and `<event-source-arn>` with the appropriate values for your setup.
