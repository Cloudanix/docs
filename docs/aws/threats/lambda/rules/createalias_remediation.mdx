### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The CreateAlias event in awsrealtime for Lambda refers to the action of creating an alias for a Lambda function in AWS.
- An alias is a pointer to a specific version of a Lambda function, allowing you to decouple your application from the underlying function version.
- By creating an alias, you can easily update the function version associated with the alias without changing the alias itself, providing flexibility and seamless updates to your application.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and creates an alias for a Lambda function, they can potentially modify the function's behavior or execute malicious code. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, disruption of services, or even compromise of the entire AWS environment.

Remediation:
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API calls made to AWS Lambda. This will help in identifying any unauthorized activity.
- Implement strong access controls by following the principle of least privilege. Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to create or modify Lambda aliases.
- Regularly review and audit IAM policies to ensure that they are up to date and do not grant excessive permissions.
- Enable AWS Config to continuously monitor and evaluate the configuration of Lambda functions, including aliases, and set up appropriate rules to detect any unauthorized changes.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AWS accounts to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access.

Example CLI command to enable CloudTrail:
```
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name lambda-trail --s3-bucket-name <your-bucket-name> --is-multi-region-trail --include-global-service-events
```

Example CLI command to enable MFA for an IAM user:
```
aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <user-name> --serial-number <mfa-serial-number> --authentication-code1 <code1> --authentication-code2 <code2>
```

2. Example of security impact: If an attacker gains access to the AWS Management Console or API credentials and creates an alias for a Lambda function, they can modify the function's code to execute malicious actions, such as exfiltrating sensitive data, launching denial-of-service attacks, or escalating privileges within the AWS environment.

Remediation:
- Implement strong password policies and enforce regular password rotation for AWS Management Console users.
- Enable AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) password policy to enforce password complexity requirements.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API calls made to AWS Lambda, and set up alerts or automated responses to detect and mitigate any unauthorized activity.
- Regularly review and rotate access keys for IAM users and roles, and ensure that they are not shared or stored insecurely.
- Implement AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely store and manage sensitive credentials used by Lambda functions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Example CLI command to enable IAM password policy:
```
aws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 12 --require-uppercase-characters --require-lowercase-characters --require-symbols --require-numbers --allow-users-to-change-password
```

Example CLI command to rotate access keys for an IAM user:
```
aws iam create-access-key --user-name <user-name>
aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id <access-key-id> --user-name <user-name>
```

3. Example of security impact: If an attacker gains access to the AWS account and creates an alias for a Lambda function, they can modify the function's code to execute unauthorized actions, such as accessing or modifying sensitive data, launching attacks on other resources, or exfiltrating data to external systems.

Remediation:
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API calls made to AWS Lambda, and set up alerts or automated responses to detect and mitigate any unauthorized activity.
- Implement AWS Lambda function versioning and aliases to ensure that only trusted and tested versions of the function are used in production.
- Regularly review and audit IAM policies to ensure that they are up to date and do not grant excessive permissions.
- Implement AWS Config to continuously monitor and evaluate the configuration of Lambda functions, including aliases, and set up appropriate rules to detect any unauthorized changes.
- Implement network security measures, such as VPCs, security groups, and network ACLs, to restrict access to Lambda functions and prevent unauthorized network traffic.

Example CLI command to enable AWS Config:
```
aws configservice put-configuration-recorder --configuration-recorder name=default,roleARN=<role-arn>,recordingGroup={allSupported=true,includeGlobalResourceTypes=true}
```

Example CLI command to create a VPC:
```
aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block <cidr-block>
```
