### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteFunction20150331 event in awsrealtime for Lambda refers to the deletion of a Lambda function in AWS.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process initiates the deletion of a Lambda function.
- It indicates that the Lambda function and its associated resources, such as triggers and permissions, have been removed from the AWS account.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS Lambda console or API and triggers the DeleteFunction20150331 event, they can delete a Lambda function that is critical to the application's functionality. This can result in service disruption, data loss, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Remediation:
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API activity related to Lambda functions.
- Implement strict IAM policies to control access to the Lambda console and API. Only authorized users or roles should have permissions to delete functions.
- Regularly backup Lambda functions using AWS CLI or SDKs to ensure quick recovery in case of accidental deletion. For example, you can use the following AWS CLI command to create a backup of a Lambda function:
  ```
  aws lambda create-function-alias --function-name <function-name> --name <alias-name> --function-version <version> --description "Backup"
  ```

2. Example of security impact: If a malicious insider gains access to the AWS CLI credentials of a user with sufficient permissions, they can execute the DeleteFunction20150331 event command to delete critical Lambda functions without detection. This can lead to significant service disruption and potential data loss.

Remediation:
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AWS IAM users to add an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access to CLI credentials.
- Regularly rotate and revoke AWS CLI credentials to minimize the risk of compromise.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail with CloudWatch Events to monitor and alert on any DeleteFunction20150331 event. You can use the following AWS CLI command to create a CloudWatch Event rule for monitoring Lambda function deletions:
  ```
  aws events put-rule --name "LambdaFunctionDeletionRule" --event-pattern "{\"source\":[\"aws.lambda\"],\"detail-type\":[\"AWS API Call via CloudTrail\"],\"detail\":{\"eventSource\":[\"lambda.amazonaws.com\"],\"eventName\":[\"DeleteFunction20150331\"]}}"
  ```

3. Example of security impact: If a Lambda function is mistakenly configured with overly permissive IAM roles or resource-based policies, an attacker can exploit this misconfiguration to trigger the DeleteFunction20150331 event and delete the function. This can result in service disruption and potential unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and update IAM roles and resource-based policies associated with Lambda functions to ensure they follow the principle of least privilege.
- Implement AWS Config rules to automatically detect and remediate any Lambda functions with overly permissive permissions. For example, you can use the following AWS CLI command to create a Config rule for checking Lambda function permissions:
  ```
  aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule file://lambda-function-permissions-rule.json
  ```
  (where `lambda-function-permissions-rule.json` is a JSON file defining the rule)
- Enable AWS CloudTrail with CloudWatch Logs to capture and analyze API calls related to Lambda function modifications, including the DeleteFunction20150331 event.
