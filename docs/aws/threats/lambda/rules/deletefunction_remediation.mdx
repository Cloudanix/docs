### Event Information

- The DeleteFunction event in AWS Lambda refers to the event that is triggered when a Lambda function is deleted.
- This event can be used to track and log the deletion of Lambda functions for auditing and monitoring purposes.
- By capturing the DeleteFunction event, you can keep track of when and by whom a Lambda function was deleted, which can be useful for troubleshooting or security purposes.


### Examples

- Unauthorized access: If the DeleteFunction operation is not properly secured, it can be vulnerable to unauthorized access. This can lead to malicious actors deleting critical Lambda functions, potentially disrupting the entire application or system.

- Data loss: Deleting a Lambda function will also delete any associated data or resources, such as event sources, triggers, and logs. If a Lambda function is accidentally deleted, it can result in permanent data loss, impacting the integrity and availability of the system.

- Compliance violations: In certain industries or organizations with strict compliance requirements, deleting a Lambda function without proper authorization or documentation can lead to compliance violations. This can result in legal and financial consequences, as well as damage to the organization's reputation. It is important to have proper access controls and audit trails in place to prevent unauthorized deletions and ensure compliance.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Secure the DeleteFunction operation:
   - Implement proper access controls and permissions for the DeleteFunction operation. This can be done by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to define granular permissions for users or roles.
   - Follow the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions to perform the DeleteFunction operation.
   - Regularly review and audit the access controls to ensure they are up to date and aligned with the organization's security policies.

2. Implement backup and recovery measures:
   - Set up regular backups of Lambda functions and associated resources using AWS services like AWS Backup or by creating manual backups.
   - Consider enabling versioning for Lambda functions to have the ability to restore previous versions if needed.
   - Test the backup and recovery process periodically to ensure it is working effectively.

3. Follow compliance procedures:
   - Establish and document compliance procedures for handling Lambda functions, including deletion processes.
   - Ensure that the deletion of Lambda functions follows the organization's compliance requirements and regulatory standards.
   - Implement proper data retention and disposal procedures to comply with data protection regulations, especially for functions containing sensitive data.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unauthorized access and ensure the proper security of the DeleteFunction operation in AWS Lambda, you can follow these steps:

- Implement IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies: Create and assign IAM policies to restrict access to the DeleteFunction operation. Only authorized users or roles should have the necessary permissions to delete Lambda functions. Use the principle of least privilege to grant only the required permissions.

- Enable AWS CloudTrail: Enable CloudTrail to monitor and log all API calls made to AWS Lambda, including the DeleteFunction operation. This will provide visibility into any unauthorized access attempts and help in identifying potential security breaches.

- Implement VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and security groups: Configure your Lambda functions to run within a VPC and associate them with appropriate security groups. This will add an additional layer of network security and restrict access to the functions from unauthorized sources.

CLI commands to implement these measures:

1. Create an IAM policy to restrict access to the DeleteFunction operation:
```
aws iam create-policy --policy-name RestrictDeleteFunction --policy-document '{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "lambda:DeleteFunction",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}'
```

2. Attach the IAM policy to the desired user or role:
```
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <user-name> --policy-arn <policy-arn>
```

3. Enable AWS CloudTrail for Lambda:
```
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name LambdaTrail --s3-bucket-name <bucket-name> --is-multi-region-trail
```

4. Configure Lambda functions to run within a VPC and associate security groups:
```
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <function-name> --vpc-config SubnetIds=<subnet-ids>,SecurityGroupIds=<security-group-ids>
```

Note: Replace the placeholders (<user-name>, <policy-arn>, <bucket-name>, <function-name>, <subnet-ids>, <security-group-ids>) with the actual values specific to your environment.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized access, you can take the following steps:

- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for the DeleteFunction operation. This can include using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to Lambda functions based on user roles and permissions. Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete functions.

- Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API calls related to Lambda functions, including DeleteFunction. This will provide visibility into any unauthorized access attempts and help in identifying potential security breaches.

- Regularly review and update IAM policies to ensure that access permissions are properly configured and aligned with the principle of least privilege. Remove any unnecessary or overly permissive permissions that could potentially be exploited by unauthorized users.

To remediate data loss:

- Implement a backup and restore strategy for Lambda functions and their associated resources. This can involve regularly creating backups of Lambda functions and storing them in a secure location, such as Amazon S3. Additionally, consider enabling AWS Lambda's built-in versioning feature to maintain a history of function configurations and code.

- Implement proper monitoring and alerting mechanisms to quickly identify and respond to any accidental or unauthorized deletion of Lambda functions. This can include setting up CloudWatch alarms to notify you when a function is deleted or when there is a significant change in the number of functions.

- Consider implementing a disaster recovery plan that includes regular testing and validation of backups, as well as procedures for restoring deleted functions and their associated data in case of an incident.

To remediate compliance violations:

- Ensure that your Lambda functions and associated resources are properly classified based on their sensitivity and compliance requirements. This can involve tagging functions with appropriate metadata to indicate their data classification and compliance requirements.

- Implement proper data retention and disposal procedures for Lambda functions that contain sensitive data. This can include defining retention periods, securely deleting data when no longer needed, and following any regulatory requirements for data protection and disposal.

- Regularly audit and review your Lambda functions to ensure compliance with relevant regulatory requirements. This can involve conducting periodic assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing to identify any potential compliance gaps or vulnerabilities.
