### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteFunction event in AWS Lambda refers to the event that is triggered when a Lambda function is deleted.
- This event can be used to track and log the deletion of Lambda functions for auditing and monitoring purposes.
- By capturing the DeleteFunction event, you can keep track of when and by whom a Lambda function was deleted, which can be useful for troubleshooting or security purposes.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteFunction in AWS Lambda, an attacker with sufficient permissions could delete critical functions, leading to service disruption or data loss.

- Remediation steps using AWS console:
  1. Implement least privilege access control: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete Lambda functions. Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create and manage fine-grained policies.
  2. Enable AWS CloudTrail: CloudTrail provides detailed logs of API activity, including DeleteFunction events. By enabling CloudTrail, you can monitor and audit function deletions, helping to identify any unauthorized or suspicious activities.
  3. Enable versioning and backups: Enable versioning for your Lambda functions to protect against accidental deletions. This allows you to restore previous versions if a function is deleted. Additionally, consider implementing automated backups or replication mechanisms to further safeguard against data loss.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteFunction in AWS Lambda, an attacker with sufficient permissions could delete critical functions, leading to service disruption or data loss.
- Remediation: To remediate this issue for AWS Lambda using AWS CLI, follow these steps:
  1. Restrict IAM permissions: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete Lambda functions. Review and modify the IAM policies to limit the DeleteFunction action to trusted entities.
  2. Enable AWS CloudTrail: Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity for Lambda functions. This will provide an audit trail of all DeleteFunction API calls, allowing you to track and investigate any unauthorized deletions.
  3. Monitor CloudTrail logs: Regularly monitor the CloudTrail logs for any suspicious or unauthorized DeleteFunction API calls. Set up alerts or notifications to be notified immediately when such events occur.

CLI commands:
- To restrict IAM permissions, modify the IAM policy to include only the necessary permissions for authorized users or roles. For example:
  ```
  aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name <role-name> --policy-arn <policy-arn>
  ```
- To enable AWS CloudTrail, use the following command:
  ```
  aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <trail-name> --s3-bucket-name <bucket-name> --is-multi-region-trail
  ```
- To monitor CloudTrail logs, you can use CloudWatch Events to trigger a Lambda function or send notifications. For example:
  ```
  aws events put-rule --name <rule-name> --event-pattern "{\"source\":[\"aws.cloudtrail\"],\"detail-type\":[\"AWS API Call via CloudTrail\"],\"detail\":{\"eventSource\":[\"lambda.amazonaws.com\"],\"eventName\":[\"DeleteFunction\"]}}"
  ```

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with DeleteFunction in AWS Lambda:
   - An attacker gains unauthorized access to the AWS account and deletes critical Lambda functions, resulting in service disruption or data loss.

2. Remediation for AWS Lambda using Python:
   - Implement strict access controls and permissions for AWS Lambda functions, ensuring that only authorized users or roles have the necessary privileges to delete functions.
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API calls related to Lambda functions, including DeleteFunction. Regularly review the CloudTrail logs for any suspicious or unauthorized activities.
   - Implement a backup and restore mechanism for Lambda functions, either by using AWS services like AWS Backup or by creating custom scripts that periodically export the function code and configuration to a secure location.

Python script for restricting DeleteFunction access using IAM policies:
```python
import boto3

def restrict_delete_function_access(lambda_function_name, role_name):
    client = boto3.client('lambda')
    iam = boto3.client('iam')

    # Get the IAM role ARN
    response = iam.get_role(RoleName=role_name)
    role_arn = response['Role']['Arn']

    # Create an IAM policy to deny DeleteFunction action
    policy_document = {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Deny",
                "Action": "lambda:DeleteFunction",
                "Resource": f"arn:aws:lambda:<region>:<account_id>:function:{lambda_function_name}"
            }
        ]
    }

    # Attach the policy to the IAM role
    response = iam.put_role_policy(
        RoleName=role_name,
        PolicyName='DenyDeleteFunction',
        PolicyDocument=json.dumps(policy_document)
    )

    # Update the Lambda function's execution role
    response = client.update_function_configuration(
        FunctionName=lambda_function_name,
        Role=role_arn
    )

    print("DeleteFunction access restricted successfully.")

# Usage example
restrict_delete_function_access('my-lambda-function', 'my-lambda-role')
```

Note: Replace `<region>`, `<account_id>`, `my-lambda-function`, and `my-lambda-role` with the appropriate values for your AWS environment.
