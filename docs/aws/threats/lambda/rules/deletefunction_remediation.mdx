### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteFunction event in awsrealtime for Lambda refers to the event triggered when a Lambda function is deleted in AWS.
- This event indicates that the Lambda function and its associated resources, such as triggers and permissions, have been removed from the AWS account.
- It is important to note that once a Lambda function is deleted, it cannot be recovered, so caution should be exercised when performing this action.

#### Example

1. Unauthorized access: If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the AWS account or the IAM role associated with the Lambda function, they can potentially trigger the DeleteFunction event and delete the function. This can be mitigated by implementing strong access controls, such as using IAM policies with the principle of least privilege, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users, and regularly reviewing and rotating access keys.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls by creating IAM policies that only grant necessary permissions to users and roles. For example, you can create a policy that allows only specific users or roles to delete Lambda functions.
- Enable MFA for IAM users to add an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access.
- Regularly review and rotate access keys to minimize the risk of compromised credentials.

AWS CLI command to create an IAM policy allowing only specific users or roles to delete Lambda functions:
```
aws iam create-policy --policy-name LambdaDeletePolicy --policy-document '{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "lambda:DeleteFunction",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:username": [
            "user1",
            "user2"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

2. Misconfigured permissions: If the permissions assigned to the IAM role associated with the Lambda function are misconfigured, it may allow unintended users or roles to delete the function. This can be mitigated by regularly reviewing and auditing the permissions assigned to IAM roles, using AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log API calls, and implementing automated checks for security best practices using AWS Config.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and audit the permissions assigned to IAM roles to ensure they are correctly configured and aligned with the principle of least privilege.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log API calls related to Lambda function deletion. This will help in identifying any unauthorized or suspicious activities.
- Use AWS Config to implement automated checks for security best practices, including checking for misconfigured permissions on IAM roles.

AWS CLI command to enable AWS CloudTrail for logging Lambda function deletion events:
```
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name LambdaTrail --s3-bucket-name <your-s3-bucket-name> --is-multi-region-trail --include-global-service-events --enable-log-file-validation
```

3. Insider threat: If an authorized user with malicious intent has access to the AWS account or the IAM role associated with the Lambda function, they can intentionally trigger the DeleteFunction event to impact security. This can be mitigated by implementing strong access controls, regularly monitoring and reviewing user activities, and implementing least privilege principles.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls by following the principle of least privilege and regularly reviewing and auditing user activities.
- Monitor and review user activities using AWS CloudTrail logs and other monitoring tools to detect any suspicious or unauthorized actions.
- Implement additional security measures such as enabling AWS GuardDuty to detect insider threats and anomalous behavior.

AWS CLI command to enable AWS GuardDuty for detecting insider threats:
```
aws guardduty create-detector --enable
```
