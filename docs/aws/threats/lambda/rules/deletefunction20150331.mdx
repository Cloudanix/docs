### Event Information

- The DeleteFunction20150331 event in AWS Lambda refers to the deletion of a Lambda function.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process initiates the deletion of a Lambda function in AWS.
- The event provides information about the function that was deleted, including its name, version, and other relevant details.


### Examples

- Unauthorized deletion of Lambda functions: If security is impacted with DeleteFunction20150331 in AWS Lambda, it could potentially lead to unauthorized deletion of Lambda functions. This could be due to misconfiguration or lack of proper access controls, allowing unauthorized users or malicious actors to delete critical functions.

- Data loss or exposure: Deleting a Lambda function without proper backup or data protection measures in place can result in data loss or exposure. If the function being deleted contains sensitive or critical data, its deletion could lead to a breach of confidentiality or loss of important information.

- Disruption of dependent services: Lambda functions often serve as building blocks for larger applications or services. If a function is deleted without considering its dependencies, it can cause disruption to other services or applications that rely on it. This can result in downtime, loss of functionality, or cascading failures in the overall system.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion, lack of access controls, and inadequate logging and monitoring for AWS Lambda using the AWS console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Unauthorized deletion:
- Enable AWS CloudTrail: CloudTrail provides detailed event logs of API activity in your AWS account, including Lambda function deletions. By enabling CloudTrail, you can track and monitor any unauthorized deletions.
- Set up CloudWatch Alarms: Create CloudWatch alarms to notify you when specific Lambda functions are deleted. This will help you quickly identify any unauthorized deletions and take appropriate action.

2. Lack of access controls:
- Implement IAM policies: Create and enforce IAM policies that define the necessary permissions for managing Lambda functions. Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete functions.
- Regularly review and update IAM policies: Regularly review and update your IAM policies to ensure that they align with your organization's security requirements. Remove any unnecessary or overly permissive permissions to minimize the risk of unauthorized deletions.

3. Inadequate logging and monitoring:
- Enable AWS Lambda function logging: Enable logging for your Lambda functions to capture detailed information about function invocations, errors, and other relevant events. This will provide valuable insights for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- Set up CloudWatch Logs: Configure CloudWatch Logs to collect and store the Lambda function logs. This will allow you to easily search, analyze, and monitor the logs for any suspicious activities or unauthorized deletions.
- Implement CloudWatch Events: Create CloudWatch Events rules to trigger notifications or automated actions based on specific events, such as Lambda function deletions. This will help you proactively detect and respond to any unauthorized deletions.

By following these steps, you can remediate unauthorized deletion, lack of access controls, and inadequate logging and monitoring for AWS Lambda using the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of Lambda functions in AWS Lambda, you can take the following steps using AWS CLI:

- Enable AWS CloudTrail: CloudTrail provides detailed logs of API activity in your AWS account, including Lambda function deletions. Enable CloudTrail to capture the necessary logs for auditing and investigation purposes.

- Implement IAM policies: Create and enforce IAM policies that restrict the DeleteFunction20150331 action to authorized users only. Ensure that users have the necessary permissions to perform this action, while preventing unauthorized access.

- Enable AWS Config: AWS Config allows you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources, including Lambda functions. Enable AWS Config to monitor and detect any unauthorized changes or deletions to Lambda functions.

2. Lack of access controls: To address the lack of access controls for the DeleteFunction20150331 action in AWS Lambda, you can use the following AWS CLI commands:

- Create an IAM policy: Define a custom IAM policy that grants the necessary permissions for authorized users to delete Lambda functions. Specify the resource-level permissions required for the DeleteFunction20150331 action.

- Attach the IAM policy: Attach the custom IAM policy to the appropriate IAM users, groups, or roles. Ensure that only authorized entities have this policy attached, preventing unauthorized users from performing the action.

- Test and validate: Verify that the access controls are working as intended by attempting to delete a Lambda function with a user who does not have the necessary permissions. The action should be denied, indicating that the access controls are effective.

3. Inadequate logging and monitoring: To address the issue of inadequate logging and monitoring for the DeleteFunction20150331 action in AWS Lambda, you can use the following AWS CLI commands:

- Enable CloudTrail: Enable CloudTrail to capture API activity logs, including Lambda function deletions. Configure CloudTrail to store the logs in a centralized S3 bucket and enable log file validation for data integrity.

- Set up CloudWatch Logs: Configure Lambda function logging to send logs to CloudWatch Logs. Enable detailed logging for Lambda functions and define appropriate log retention periods.

- Create CloudWatch Alarms: Set up CloudWatch Alarms to monitor and alert on specific events, such as Lambda function deletions. Define thresholds and actions to be taken when an alarm is triggered, such as sending notifications or invoking automated remediation processes.

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized deletion:
- Implement strong access controls and permissions for AWS Lambda functions. Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete functions.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture all API calls related to Lambda functions, including deletions. Regularly review and analyze the CloudTrail logs to identify any unauthorized deletion attempts.

2. Lack of access controls:
- Create an IAM policy that grants the necessary permissions for managing Lambda functions, including the ability to delete functions. Assign this policy to the appropriate IAM users or roles.
- Regularly review and audit the IAM policies to ensure that only authorized users have the required permissions for the DeleteFunction20150331 action.

3. Inadequate logging and monitoring:
- Enable AWS CloudTrail for Lambda functions and configure it to capture all relevant API events, including deletions. Ensure that the CloudTrail logs are stored securely and retained for an appropriate period.
- Implement a centralized logging solution, such as AWS CloudWatch Logs, to collect and analyze logs from Lambda functions. Set up alarms and notifications to alert on any suspicious deletion activities.
- Consider using AWS Config to continuously monitor the configuration of Lambda functions and detect any unauthorized changes, including deletions.
