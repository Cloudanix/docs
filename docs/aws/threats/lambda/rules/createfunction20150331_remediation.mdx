### Event Information

- The CreateFunction20150331 event in AWS for Lambda refers to the creation of a new Lambda function in the AWS environment.
- This event indicates that a user or an automated process has successfully created a new Lambda function using the AWS Lambda service.
- The event provides information about the function's configuration, such as its name, runtime, handler, and other settings that were specified during the creation process.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized access: If the CreateFunction20150331 API call in AWS Lambda is not properly secured, it can potentially allow unauthorized users to create or modify Lambda functions. This can lead to malicious actors gaining access to sensitive data or executing unauthorized code within the environment.

2. Insecure function configurations: If security best practices are not followed during the creation of Lambda functions using the CreateFunction20150331 API, it can result in insecure function configurations. For example, if the function is granted excessive permissions or if it is not properly isolated from other resources, it can increase the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

3. Vulnerability exploitation: If the CreateFunction20150331 API call is used to create Lambda functions with outdated or vulnerable runtime environments, it can expose the functions to potential exploitation. Attackers can leverage known vulnerabilities in the runtime environment to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or perform other malicious activities within the Lambda environment. Regular updates and patching of the runtime environment are crucial to mitigate this risk.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized access: To remediate unauthorized access to AWS Lambda functions, follow these steps:

- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the AWS Lambda service. This can include using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control user access and permissions.
- Regularly review and update IAM policies to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to create or modify Lambda functions.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log API calls related to Lambda functions. This will help in identifying any unauthorized access attempts and provide an audit trail for investigation.

2. Insecure function configurations: To remediate insecure function configurations in AWS Lambda, consider the following steps:

- Follow security best practices while creating Lambda functions. This includes properly configuring function permissions, limiting network access, and implementing encryption for sensitive data.
- Regularly review and update function configurations to ensure they align with security requirements and best practices.
- Utilize AWS Config to monitor and enforce compliance with security configurations. This can help identify and remediate any insecure function configurations.

3. Vulnerability to code injection attacks: To remediate vulnerability to code injection attacks in AWS Lambda, take the following actions:

- Implement input validation and sanitization techniques to ensure that user-supplied input is properly validated and sanitized before being processed by the Lambda function.
- Regularly review and update the function code to ensure it follows secure coding practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and parameterized queries.
- Utilize AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to detect and block common code injection attacks, such as SQL injection or OS command injection.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access, insecure function configurations, and code injection attacks in AWS Lambda.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized access: To remediate unauthorized access in AWS Lambda, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies.
- Restrict access to the CreateFunction20150331 API call by configuring appropriate IAM permissions for the user or role executing the command.
- Regularly review and audit IAM permissions to ensure they are up to date and aligned with the principle of least privilege.

Example CLI commands:
```
aws lambda create-function --function-name my-function --runtime python3.8 --handler index.handler --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-role --code S3Bucket=my-bucket,S3Key=my-function.zip
```

2. Insecure function configurations: To remediate insecure function configurations in AWS Lambda, consider the following steps:

- Follow AWS Lambda security best practices, such as configuring function permissions, network access, and encryption appropriately.
- Implement proper network security measures, such as using Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit for sensitive data processed by the Lambda function.

Example CLI commands:
```
aws lambda create-function --function-name my-function --runtime python3.8 --handler index.handler --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-role --code S3Bucket=my-bucket,S3Key=my-function.zip --vpc-config SubnetIds=subnet-12345678,SecurityGroupIds=sg-12345678
```

3. Vulnerability to code injection attacks: To remediate vulnerability to code injection attacks in AWS Lambda, consider the following steps:

- Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent malicious code injection.
- Follow secure coding practices and avoid using user-supplied input directly in the function code without proper validation.
- Regularly update and patch the Lambda runtime environment to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

Example CLI commands:
```
aws lambda create-function --function-name my-function --runtime python3.8 --handler index.handler --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-role --code S3Bucket=my-bucket,S3Key=my-function.zip --environment Variables={KEY1=value1,KEY2=value2}
```
