### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The CreateFunction20150331 event in awsrealtime for Lambda refers to the event generated when a new Lambda function is created in AWS.
- This event signifies the successful creation of a Lambda function and provides information about the function's configuration, such as its name, runtime, handler, and other settings.
- It can be used to track and monitor the creation of Lambda functions in real-time, allowing users to automate processes or trigger actions based on the creation of new functions.

#### Example

- One possible way security can be impacted with the CreateFunction20150331 event in AWS Lambda is if the function code being uploaded contains malicious code or vulnerabilities. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or execution of unauthorized actions within the Lambda environment.

Remediation:
1. Implement secure coding practices and perform thorough code reviews to ensure that the function code being uploaded is free from vulnerabilities and malicious code.
2. Enable AWS Lambda function versioning and aliases to easily roll back to a previous version in case of security issues. This allows you to quickly revert to a known good state if a security incident occurs.

Example CLI command to enable versioning for a Lambda function:
```
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <function-name> --versioning-config Enabled=true
```

Example CLI command to create an alias for a Lambda function:
```
aws lambda create-alias --function-name <function-name> --name <alias-name> --function-version <version>
```

Note: It is important to regularly update and patch the underlying operating system and dependencies used by the Lambda function to mitigate any potential security vulnerabilities.
