### Event Information

- The CreateStack event in AWS CloudFormation refers to the process of creating a new stack, which is a collection of AWS resources defined in a CloudFormation template.
- This event signifies the start of the stack creation process, where CloudFormation provisions and configures the specified resources according to the template.
- The CreateStack event provides information about the stack name, template URL or S3 location, parameters, and other details required for the stack creation.


### Examples

- Insecure parameter values: If sensitive information such as passwords or access keys are passed as plain text in the CloudFormation template or as parameters, it can lead to security risks. It is important to ensure that sensitive information is properly encrypted or stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.

- Insufficient IAM permissions: If the IAM role or user executing the CreateStack operation does not have the necessary permissions, it can result in security issues. It is crucial to follow the principle of least privilege and grant only the required permissions to the IAM entity executing the operation.

- Lack of stack-level security controls: CloudFormation stacks can contain various AWS resources, and each resource may have its own security controls. If stack-level security controls are not properly defined, it can lead to misconfigurations and potential security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to implement security best practices such as using AWS Config rules, AWS CloudTrail for auditing, and AWS CloudFormation StackSets for centralized management and control of stacks.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate insecure parameter values in AWS CloudFormation using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Encrypt sensitive information: Instead of passing sensitive information such as passwords or access keys as plain text in the CloudFormation template or as parameters, it is recommended to encrypt them. You can use AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely store and retrieve sensitive information.

2. Update the CloudFormation template: Modify the CloudFormation template to reference the encrypted values from AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store instead of passing them as plain text. This ensures that the sensitive information is securely stored and accessed during the stack creation process.

3. Test and deploy the updated stack: After making the necessary changes to the CloudFormation template, test it to ensure that the stack creation process works as expected. Deploy the updated stack using the AWS CloudFormation console by selecting the modified template and providing any required parameters. Verify that the stack is created successfully and the sensitive information is securely retrieved from the encrypted storage.

By following these steps, you can remediate insecure parameter values in AWS CloudFormation and ensure that sensitive information is properly encrypted and stored securely.

#### Using CLI

To remediate insecure parameter values in AWS CloudFormation using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Encrypt sensitive information: Ensure that sensitive information such as passwords or access keys are properly encrypted before passing them as parameters in the CloudFormation template. You can use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt the sensitive values.

2. Store sensitive information securely: Instead of passing sensitive information directly in the CloudFormation template, store them securely in AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. You can use the AWS CLI to create and manage secrets or parameters in these services.

3. Update CloudFormation template: Modify the CloudFormation template to retrieve the sensitive information from AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store during stack creation. Update the template to reference the stored values instead of passing them as plain text parameters.

Example CLI commands:

- To encrypt a sensitive value using AWS KMS:
```
aws kms encrypt --key-id <kms_key_id> --plaintext <sensitive_value> --output text --query CiphertextBlob
```

- To create a secret in AWS Secrets Manager:
```
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name <secret_name> --secret-string <sensitive_value>
```

- To create a parameter in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store:
```
aws ssm put-parameter --name <parameter_name> --value <sensitive_value> --type SecureString
```

- To update the CloudFormation template to reference the stored values:
Modify the template to use the appropriate functions or references to retrieve the values from AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. For example:
```
"Parameters": {
  "MySecretParameter": {
    "Type": "AWS::SecretsManager::SecretValue",
    "Default": "/path/to/secret"
  }
}
```

Remember to replace `<kms_key_id>`, `<sensitive_value>`, `<secret_name>`, `<parameter_name>`, and `/path/to/secret` with the actual values specific to your environment.

#### Using Python

To remediate insecure parameter values in AWS CloudFormation using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Encrypt sensitive information: Instead of passing sensitive information such as passwords or access keys as plain text in the CloudFormation template or as parameters, you can encrypt them using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). You can use the `boto3` library in Python to interact with KMS and encrypt the sensitive values before passing them to CloudFormation.

```python
import boto3

def encrypt_value(value):
    kms_client = boto3.client('kms')
    response = kms_client.encrypt(
        KeyId='your_kms_key_id',
        Plaintext=value
    )
    return response['CiphertextBlob']
```

2. Store sensitive information in AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store: Instead of passing sensitive information directly in the CloudFormation template, you can store them securely in AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. You can use the `boto3` library in Python to interact with these services and retrieve the values during stack creation.

```python
import boto3

def get_secret_value(secret_name):
    secrets_manager_client = boto3.client('secretsmanager')
    response = secrets_manager_client.get_secret_value(
        SecretId=secret_name
    )
    return response['SecretString']
```

3. Update CloudFormation template to reference encrypted values or secrets: Once you have encrypted the sensitive values or stored them in Secrets Manager or Parameter Store, you need to update your CloudFormation template to reference these encrypted values or secrets. You can use the `Fn::ImportValue` function in CloudFormation to retrieve the values stored in Parameter Store or Secrets Manager.

```yaml
Parameters:
  MySecret:
    Type: String
    Default: !ImportValue MySecretParameter

Resources:
  MyResource:
    Type: AWS::SomeResource
    Properties:
      Password: !Ref MySecret
```

By following these steps and using the provided Python scripts, you can remediate insecure parameter values in AWS CloudFormation and ensure that sensitive information is properly encrypted or stored securely.
