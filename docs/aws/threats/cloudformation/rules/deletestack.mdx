### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteStack event in AWS CloudFormation refers to the event triggered when a CloudFormation stack is being deleted.
- This event indicates that the resources defined in the CloudFormation stack are being removed from the AWS environment.
- The DeleteStack event can be used to track the progress and status of the stack deletion process, allowing users to monitor and manage the deletion of resources in a CloudFormation stack.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and initiates a DeleteStack event in CloudFormation, it can lead to the deletion of critical infrastructure resources, resulting in service disruption or data loss. This can be particularly damaging if the stack being deleted contains sensitive data or controls access to other resources.

Remediation:
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all IAM users to prevent unauthorized access to the AWS account.
- Implement strict IAM policies to limit the permissions of users and roles, ensuring that only authorized individuals can perform stack deletion operations.
- Regularly monitor CloudTrail logs for any suspicious activities related to CloudFormation stack deletions. Set up CloudWatch Events to trigger notifications or automated actions when a DeleteStack event is detected.

Example CLI commands:
```
# Enable MFA for an IAM user
aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <user-name> --serial-number <mfa-serial-number> --authentication-code1 <code1> --authentication-code2 <code2>

# Create an IAM policy to restrict stack deletion permissions
aws iam create-policy --policy-name <policy-name> --policy-document file://policy.json

# Attach the policy to a user or role
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <user-name> --policy-arn <policy-arn>

# Set up CloudWatch Events rule to trigger on DeleteStack events
aws events put-rule --name <rule-name> --event-pattern "{\"source\":[\"aws.cloudformation\"],\"detail-type\":[\"AWS API Call via CloudTrail\"],\"detail\":{\"eventSource\":[\"cloudformation.amazonaws.com\"],\"eventName\":[\"DeleteStack\"]}}"

# Create a CloudWatch Events target to send notifications or trigger automated actions
aws events put-targets --rule <rule-name> --targets "Id"="1","Arn"="<target-arn>"
```

Note: Replace `<user-name>`, `<mfa-serial-number>`, `<code1>`, `<code2>`, `<policy-name>`, `<policy-arn>`, `<rule-name>`, and `<target-arn>` with appropriate values. Also, ensure that the `policy.json` file contains the desired policy document.
