### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteBucket event in AWS S3 refers to the event triggered when a bucket is deleted in real-time.
- This event indicates that all objects and versions within the bucket have been permanently deleted.
- It is important to note that this event cannot be reversed, and the bucket and its contents cannot be recovered once deleted.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and performs a DeleteBucket event in S3, it can lead to the following security risks:
   - Data loss: The unauthorized deletion of a bucket can result in the permanent loss of all objects and data stored within it.
   - Unauthorized access: If the bucket contained sensitive or confidential data, its deletion could potentially expose this information to unauthorized individuals.
   - Compliance violations: Depending on the nature of the data stored in the bucket, its deletion could lead to non-compliance with industry regulations or internal security policies.

2. Remediation steps:
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the AWS account: By enabling MFA, you add an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access to the account.
   - Implement strong access control policies: Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to perform DeleteBucket operations. Use IAM policies to restrict access to S3 resources based on the principle of least privilege.
   - Enable versioning and regular backups: Enabling versioning for S3 buckets can help protect against accidental or malicious deletions. Additionally, regularly backing up the bucket's contents to a separate location or using AWS Backup can provide an additional layer of protection against data loss.

3. AWS CLI commands for remediation:
   - Enable MFA for the AWS account:
     ```
     aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <user-name> --serial-number <mfa-serial-number> --authentication-code1 <code1> --authentication-code2 <code2>
     ```
   - Restrict access to S3 bucket using IAM policies:
     ```
     aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name> --policy file://bucket-policy.json
     ```
   - Enable versioning for S3 bucket:
     ```
     aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket <bucket-name> --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
     ```
