### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The CreateRegexPatternSet event in AWS WAF refers to the action of creating a new regex pattern set within the Web Application Firewall (WAF) service.
- A regex pattern set is a collection of regular expressions that can be used to match and block specific patterns or strings in incoming web requests.
- This event indicates that a new regex pattern set has been created, which can then be associated with a WAF web ACL to provide protection against common web application attacks.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Security impact: The CreateRegexPatternSet operation in AWS WAF allows the creation of a regular expression pattern set, which is used to match patterns in web requests. If security is impacted, it could mean that the regular expression pattern set is not properly configured, leading to false positives or false negatives in matching patterns and potentially allowing malicious requests to bypass the WAF.

- Example: Let's say you have created a regex pattern set to block SQL injection attempts, but the pattern set is not properly configured. As a result, legitimate requests containing SQL queries may be blocked, impacting the functionality of your application.

- Remediation steps using AWS console:
  1. Open the AWS WAF console and navigate to the "Web ACLs" page.
  2. Select the web ACL that contains the regex pattern set you want to remediate.
  3. In the "Rules" tab, locate the rule that references the regex pattern set.
  4. Click on the rule to edit it.
  5. In the rule editor, review the regular expression patterns in the pattern set.
  6. Ensure that the patterns are correctly defined and do not inadvertently block legitimate requests.
  7. Make any necessary modifications to the patterns or add new patterns as required.
  8. Save the changes to the rule.
  9. Test the updated rule by sending sample requests and verifying that the expected behavior is observed.
  10. Monitor the WAF logs and adjust the regex pattern set if any further issues or false positives/negatives are identified.

Note: It is important to regularly review and update regex pattern sets to ensure they accurately match the intended patterns and do not impact the security or functionality of your application.

#### Using CLI

- Security can be impacted with CreateRegexPatternSet in AWS WAF if the regular expression pattern used is not properly validated or if it allows for malicious input.
- For example, if a regular expression pattern is created without proper input validation, it may allow for a pattern that can be exploited by attackers to bypass the WAF rules and potentially compromise the security of the application.
- To remediate this, it is important to ensure that the regular expression pattern used in CreateRegexPatternSet is properly validated and follows best practices for security. This includes validating user input, using appropriate escape characters, and considering potential edge cases.

To remediate this issue for AWS WAF using AWS CLI, the following CLI commands can be used:

1. Create a new regex pattern set:
```
aws wafv2 create-regex-pattern-set --name <pattern-set-name> --scope CLOUDFRONT --description <description>
```

2. Add a regex pattern to the pattern set:
```
aws wafv2 create-regex-pattern-set --name <pattern-set-name> --scope CLOUDFRONT --description <description> --regular-expression-list "RegexPatternString=<regex-pattern>"
```

3. Associate the pattern set with a web ACL:
```
aws wafv2 associate-web-acl --web-acl-arn <web-acl-arn> --resource-arn <resource-arn> --action "ALLOW" --priority <priority> --scope CLOUDFRONT
```

Note: Replace `<pattern-set-name>`, `<description>`, `<regex-pattern>`, `<web-acl-arn>`, `<resource-arn>`, and `<priority>` with the appropriate values for your environment.

#### Using Python

1. Impact on Security: When using the CreateRegexPatternSet API in AWS WAF, security can be impacted if the regular expression pattern provided is not properly validated or if it allows for malicious input. This can lead to bypassing of WAF rules and potential security vulnerabilities.

2. Remediation Steps: To remediate this issue and ensure security with CreateRegexPatternSet in AWS WAF using Python, you can follow these steps:

   a. Input Validation: Implement proper input validation to ensure that the regular expression pattern provided is safe and does not allow for malicious input. This can be done by using a trusted regular expression library or by implementing custom validation logic.

   b. Sanitization: Sanitize the regular expression pattern to remove any potentially dangerous characters or sequences. This can be achieved by using built-in sanitization functions or by implementing custom sanitization logic.

   c. Testing and Monitoring: Regularly test and monitor the effectiveness of the regex pattern set in blocking malicious input. This can be done by simulating various attack scenarios and ensuring that the WAF rules are correctly applied.

Python Script Example:
```python
import boto3

def create_regex_pattern_set(pattern_set_name, regex_patterns):
    waf_client = boto3.client('waf')
    
    response = waf_client.create_regex_pattern_set(
        Name=pattern_set_name,
        RegularExpressionList=[
            {
                'RegexPatternString': pattern
            }
            for pattern in regex_patterns
        ]
    )
    
    return response['RegexPatternSet']['RegexPatternSetId']

# Example usage
pattern_set_name = 'MyPatternSet'
regex_patterns = ['example.com', '.*\.example\.com']

pattern_set_id = create_regex_pattern_set(pattern_set_name, regex_patterns)
print(f"Created Regex Pattern Set with ID: {pattern_set_id}")
```

Note: The above script demonstrates the basic usage of the `create_regex_pattern_set` function to create a regex pattern set in AWS WAF. However, it does not include input validation and sanitization logic, which should be implemented based on your specific requirements and security considerations.
