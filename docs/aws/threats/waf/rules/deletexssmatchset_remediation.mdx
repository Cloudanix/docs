### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteXssMatchSet event in AWS WAF refers to the action of deleting an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) match set.
- XSS match sets are used in AWS WAF to define patterns or rules that help identify and block potential XSS attacks on web applications.
- When the DeleteXssMatchSet event occurs, it means that a specific XSS match set has been removed from the AWS WAF configuration, and any associated rules or conditions related to that match set will no longer be enforced.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteXssMatchSet in AWS WAF, it could potentially lead to the removal of a cross-site scripting (XSS) match set that is crucial for protecting web applications against XSS attacks. This can result in an increased risk of XSS vulnerabilities and potential exploitation of sensitive data.

- Remediation steps using AWS console:
  1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS WAF service.
  2. In the left navigation pane, click on "XSS Match Sets" under the "Web ACLs" section.
  3. Identify the XSS match set that was mistakenly deleted and note down its details, including the filters and rules associated with it.
  4. Click on the "XSS Match Sets" tab and then click on the "Create XSS Match Set" button.
  5. Enter the necessary details for the new XSS match set, including a name and description.
  6. Add the appropriate filters and rules to the new XSS match set, ensuring that it provides the necessary protection against XSS attacks.
  7. Once the new XSS match set is configured, click on the "Save" button to create it.
  8. Update the relevant web ACLs to include the newly created XSS match set, ensuring that the appropriate rules are applied to the desired resources.
  9. Test the updated configuration to verify that the XSS protection is working as expected.
  10. Monitor the web application for any signs of XSS attacks and take appropriate actions if any vulnerabilities are detected.

Note: It is important to regularly backup and document the configuration of AWS WAF, including match sets, filters, and rules, to avoid accidental deletions and ensure quick recovery in case of any security incidents.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteXssMatchSet in AWS WAF, it could potentially lead to the removal of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) match set that is crucial for protecting web applications against XSS attacks. This can result in an increased risk of XSS vulnerabilities and potential exploitation of the application.

- Remediation using AWS CLI:
  1. First, identify the specific XSS match set that was mistakenly deleted using the `list-xss-match-sets` command:
     ```
     aws wafv2 list-xss-match-sets --scope CLOUDFRONT --region <region>
     ```

  2. Once you have identified the deleted XSS match set, you can recreate it using the `create-xss-match-set` command and providing the necessary parameters:
     ```
     aws wafv2 create-xss-match-set --name <match-set-name> --scope CLOUDFRONT --region <region>
     ```

  3. After recreating the XSS match set, you can then add the necessary XSS match conditions using the `create-xss-match-tuple` command:
     ```
     aws wafv2 create-xss-match-tuple --name <match-set-name> --scope CLOUDFRONT --region <region> --xss-match-tuple fieldToMatch={type=URI_PATH},textTransformation=NONE
     ```

  It is important to note that the specific commands may vary depending on your AWS CLI configuration and the region you are working in. Make sure to replace `<region>` with the appropriate AWS region and provide the necessary values for `<match-set-name>` and any other required parameters.

#### Using Python

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteXssMatchSet in AWS WAF, it could potentially lead to the removal of an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) match set that is crucial for protecting web applications against XSS attacks. This can result in an increased risk of malicious code injection and compromise of sensitive data.

- Remediation Steps using Python:
  1. First, ensure that you have the necessary AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed.
  2. Use the following Python script as an example to remediate the issue by recreating the deleted XSS match set:

```python
import boto3

def remediate_delete_xss_match_set(waf_client, xss_match_set_id, xss_match_set_name, xss_match_tuples):
    try:
        # Create a new XSS match set
        response = waf_client.create_xss_match_set(
            Name=xss_match_set_name,
            ChangeToken=waf_client.get_change_token()['ChangeToken']
        )
        new_xss_match_set_id = response['XssMatchSet']['XssMatchSetId']

        # Add the XSS match tuples to the new match set
        for xss_match_tuple in xss_match_tuples:
            waf_client.create_xss_match_tuple(
                XssMatchSetId=new_xss_match_set_id,
                FieldToMatch=xss_match_tuple['FieldToMatch'],
                TextTransformation=xss_match_tuple['TextTransformation'],
                ChangeToken=waf_client.get_change_token()['ChangeToken']
            )

        # Update the WAF web ACL to use the new XSS match set
        waf_client.update_web_acl(
            WebACLId='YOUR_WEB_ACL_ID',
            Updates=[
                {
                    'Action': 'INSERT',
                    'ActivatedRule': {
                        'Priority': 1,
                        'RuleId': 'YOUR_RULE_ID',
                        'Action': {
                            'Type': 'WAF',
                            'WafAction': {
                                'Type': 'COUNT',
                                'Data': {
                                    'Value': '0'
                                }
                            }
                        },
                        'OverrideAction': {
                            'Type': 'NONE'
                        },
                        'Type': 'XSS_MATCH',
                        'XssMatchTuple': {
                            'FieldToMatch': {
                                'Type': 'URI'
                            },
                            'TextTransformation': 'NONE'
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        )

        print("Remediation completed successfully.")

    except Exception as e:
        print("Error occurred during remediation:", str(e))


# Usage example
waf_client = boto3.client('waf')
xss_match_set_id = 'YOUR_XSS_MATCH_SET_ID'
xss_match_set_name = 'YOUR_XSS_MATCH_SET_NAME'
xss_match_tuples = [
    {
        'FieldToMatch': {
            'Type': 'URI'
        },
        'TextTransformation': 'NONE'
    },
    {
        'FieldToMatch': {
            'Type': 'QUERY_STRING'
        },
        'TextTransformation': 'NONE'
    }
]

remediate_delete_xss_match_set(waf_client, xss_match_set_id, xss_match_set_name, xss_match_tuples)
```

Please note that you need to replace the placeholders ('YOUR_WEB_ACL_ID', 'YOUR_RULE_ID', 'YOUR_XSS_MATCH_SET_ID', 'YOUR_XSS_MATCH_SET_NAME') with the actual values from your AWS environment.
