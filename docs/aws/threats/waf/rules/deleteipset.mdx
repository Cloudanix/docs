### Event Information

- The DeleteIPSet event in AWS WAF refers to the action of deleting an IP set, which is a collection of IP addresses or IP address ranges that are used to create rules for web application firewall (WAF) rulesets.
- This event indicates that an administrator or user has initiated the deletion of an IP set, which could be done to remove outdated or unnecessary IP addresses from the WAF configuration.
- It is important to monitor this event to ensure that the deletion is intentional and authorized, as it can impact the effectiveness of WAF rules and the security of the protected web applications.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If an attacker gains access to the necessary credentials or privileges, they could potentially delete an IP set in AWS WAF, thereby impacting the security of the application. This could result in the removal of important IP addresses or ranges that were previously blocked, allowing malicious traffic to reach the application.

2. Accidental deletion: In some cases, a user with legitimate access to the AWS WAF service may accidentally delete an IP set. This could happen due to human error or lack of proper training. Accidental deletion can lead to unintended consequences, such as removing IP addresses that were meant to be blocked, leaving the application vulnerable to attacks.

3. Malicious insider activity: If an insider with malicious intent gains access to the AWS WAF service, they could deliberately delete IP sets to bypass security measures and allow unauthorized traffic to reach the application. This could be part of a larger attack strategy aimed at compromising the application or stealing sensitive data. Monitoring and controlling access to the AWS WAF service is crucial to prevent such incidents.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized deletion:
   - Regularly review and rotate access credentials for AWS WAF to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users with access to the AWS WAF service to add an extra layer of security.

2. Accidental deletion:
   - Provide proper training and documentation to users with access to the AWS WAF service to ensure they understand the potential impact of deleting an IP set.
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity and set up alerts to notify administrators when an IP set is deleted, allowing for quick remediation.

3. Malicious insider threat:
   - Implement the principle of least privilege by granting only necessary permissions to users with access to the AWS WAF service.
   - Regularly monitor and audit the activity logs of the AWS WAF service to detect any suspicious or unauthorized actions, such as the deletion of IP sets.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unauthorized deletion, accidental deletion, and malicious insider threats for AWS WAF, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI:

1. Unauthorized deletion:
   - Regularly monitor and review AWS WAF logs and CloudTrail logs to detect any unauthorized access or suspicious activities.
   - Implement strong access controls and least privilege principles to restrict access to AWS WAF resources.
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AWS accounts to add an extra layer of security.

2. Accidental deletion:
   - Implement proper training and education for users with access to the AWS WAF service to ensure they understand the potential impact of deleting IP sets.
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API calls related to AWS WAF and set up alerts for any deletion events.
   - Regularly backup IP sets and other important configurations to quickly restore them in case of accidental deletion.

3. Malicious insider threat:
   - Implement strict access controls and regularly review and update user permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture all API calls related to AWS WAF and set up real-time alerts for any suspicious activities.
   - Regularly monitor and review AWS WAF logs and CloudTrail logs to detect any unauthorized or malicious activities.

CLI commands for AWS WAF:
- To list all IP sets: `aws wafv2 list-ip-sets`
- To create a new IP set: `aws wafv2 create-ip-set --name <ip-set-name> --scope <REGIONAL or CLOUDFRONT> --addresses <list-of-ip-addresses>`
- To update an existing IP set: `aws wafv2 update-ip-set --name <ip-set-name> --scope <REGIONAL or CLOUDFRONT> --addresses <list-of-ip-addresses>`
- To delete an IP set: `aws wafv2 delete-ip-set --name <ip-set-name> --scope <REGIONAL or CLOUDFRONT>`

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion, accidental deletion, and malicious insider threats for AWS WAF, you can use the following approaches:

1. Implement strong access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have access to the AWS WAF service and its associated resources. Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage user permissions and enforce the principle of least privilege. Regularly review and update access policies to prevent unauthorized access.

2. Enable versioning and backups: Enable versioning for AWS WAF IP sets to maintain a history of changes. This allows you to restore previous versions in case of accidental or unauthorized deletions. Additionally, regularly back up your IP sets to a secure location to ensure you can recover them if needed.

3. Monitor and audit changes: Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track changes made to AWS WAF IP sets. Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API calls and monitor for any suspicious or unauthorized activities. Regularly review the logs and audit trails to identify any unauthorized deletions or suspicious behavior.

Here's an example of a Python script that demonstrates how to restore a deleted AWS WAF IP set using the Boto3 library:

```python
import boto3

def restore_ip_set(ip_set_id):
    client = boto3.client('waf')

    try:
        response = client.get_ip_set(
            IPSetId=ip_set_id
        )
        ip_set = response['IPSet']
        
        response = client.create_ip_set(
            Name=ip_set['Name'],
            IPSetDescriptors=ip_set['IPSetDescriptors']
        )
        
        print("IP set restored successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error restoring IP set:", str(e))

# Usage
ip_set_id = 'your_ip_set_id'
restore_ip_set(ip_set_id)
```

Please note that this is a basic example and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements and environment.
