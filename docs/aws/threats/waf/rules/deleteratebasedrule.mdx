### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteRateBasedRule event in AWS WAF refers to the deletion of a rate-based rule, which is a type of rule used to protect against HTTP flood attacks.
- This event indicates that a rate-based rule, which is configured to block or allow requests based on the rate at which they are received, has been deleted from the AWS WAF configuration.
- The DeleteRateBasedRule event can be used to track changes and modifications made to the rate-based rules in the WAF configuration, providing visibility into the management of security rules for protecting web applications.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteRateBasedRule event in AWS WAF:
   - An attacker gains unauthorized access to the AWS account and deletes a rate-based rule in AWS WAF. This rule was previously configured to protect against a high volume of malicious requests targeting a specific web application.
   - As a result, the web application becomes vulnerable to a flood of malicious requests, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or other security breaches.

2. Remediation steps for the impacted security with DeleteRateBasedRule event in AWS WAF:
   - Immediately revoke the unauthorized access by disabling or removing the compromised AWS credentials or IAM user.
   - Restore the deleted rate-based rule in AWS WAF to reinstate the protection against the high volume of malicious requests.
   - Analyze the logs and investigate the incident to identify any other potential security breaches or unauthorized activities.

3. AWS CLI command to restore a deleted rate-based rule in AWS WAF:
   ```
   aws wafv2 create-rule-group \
   --name "MyRateBasedRuleGroup" \
   --scope CLOUDFRONT \
   --capacity 1000 \
   --rules file://rate_based_rules.json
   ```
   Note: `rate_based_rules.json` should contain the rule configuration details for the rate-based rule that was deleted. Adjust the command parameters as per your specific requirements and environment.
