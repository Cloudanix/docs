### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet event in AWS WAF refers to the action of deleting a SQL injection match set.
- A SQL injection match set is a collection of rules that AWS WAF uses to identify and block SQL injection attacks on web applications.
- When the DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet event occurs, it means that a SQL injection match set has been removed from the AWS WAF configuration, and any associated rules and conditions are no longer active.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet in AWS WAF, it means that the SQL injection match set, which is used to identify and block SQL injection attacks, has been deleted. This can potentially leave the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, allowing attackers to manipulate or extract data from the database.

- Remediation steps using AWS console:
  1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS WAF service.
  2. In the AWS WAF console, select the appropriate web ACL that contains the affected SQL injection match set.
  3. Under the "Rules" tab, click on "Managed rules".
  4. Locate the SQL injection match set that was deleted and click on the "Add rule" button next to it.
  5. Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the SQL injection match set with the desired settings.
  6. Once the match set is configured, click on the "Update web ACL" button to apply the changes.
  7. Test the updated web ACL to ensure that the SQL injection match set is functioning correctly and providing the desired security protection against SQL injection attacks.

Note: It is important to regularly monitor and review the AWS WAF configuration to ensure that all necessary security measures are in place and that no critical components, such as the SQL injection match set, have been inadvertently deleted. Regular backups and version control of the AWS WAF configuration can also help in case of accidental deletions.

#### Using CLI

- Example of security impact: If the DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet operation in AWS WAF is misconfigured or misused, it can potentially lead to the deletion of a valid SQL injection match set. This can result in the loss of protection against SQL injection attacks, leaving the application vulnerable to exploitation.

- Remediation for AWS WAF using AWS CLI:
  1. First, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform the remediation steps.
  2. To remediate the security impact, you can use the `create-sql-injection-match-set` command to recreate the deleted SQL injection match set. This command creates a new SQL injection match set with the specified name.
  3. Once the new SQL injection match set is created, you can associate it with the appropriate web ACL using the `update-web-acl` command. This ensures that the protection against SQL injection attacks is restored.

Example CLI commands:
```
aws waf create-sql-injection-match-set --name <new_match_set_name> --region <region>
aws waf update-web-acl --web-acl-id <web_acl_id> --updates Action=INSERT,ActivatedRule={Priority=<priority_number>,RuleId=<rule_id>,Type=SQLiMatchSet,SqlInjectionMatchSetId=<new_match_set_id>} --region <region>
```
Note: Replace `<new_match_set_name>`, `<region>`, `<web_acl_id>`, `<priority_number>`, `<rule_id>`, and `<new_match_set_id>` with the appropriate values specific to your environment.

#### Using Python

- Example of security impact: If the DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet operation in AWS WAF is misconfigured or misused, it can potentially lead to the unintended deletion of a SQL injection match set. This can result in the loss of important security rules and leave the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

- Remediation for AWS WAF using Python:
  1. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to perform the DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet operation. This can be achieved by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to the WAF resources.
  
  ```python
  import boto3

  def restrict_delete_sql_injection_match_set():
      waf_client = boto3.client('waf')

      # Specify the IAM role or user ARN that should have permission to delete SQL injection match sets
      allowed_arns = ['arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/allowed-role']

      # Create a new IAM policy that allows only the specified ARNs to perform the DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet operation
      policy_document = {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": "waf:DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet",
                  "Resource": "*",
                  "Condition": {
                      "ArnEquals": {
                          "aws:SourceArn": allowed_arns
                      }
                  }
              }
          ]
      }

      # Attach the policy to the IAM users or roles that should have permission
      for arn in allowed_arns:
          waf_client.put_permission_policy(
              ResourceArn='arn:aws:waf::123456789012:sql-injection-match-set/your-match-set-id',
              Policy=''.join(policy_document),
              PolicyName='RestrictDeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet'
          )
  ```
  
  2. Enable AWS CloudTrail logging: By enabling AWS CloudTrail, you can capture all API calls made to AWS WAF, including the DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet operation. This allows you to monitor and audit any deletions made to the SQL injection match sets, helping to identify any unauthorized or accidental deletions.
  
  ```python
  import boto3

  def enable_cloudtrail_logging():
      cloudtrail_client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')

      # Specify the name of the CloudTrail trail that should be used for logging
      trail_name = 'your-trail-name'

      # Enable logging for the DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet operation in AWS WAF
      cloudtrail_client.update_trail(
          Name=trail_name,
          EventSelectors=[
              {
                  'ReadWriteType': 'WriteOnly',
                  'IncludeManagementEvents': False,
                  'DataResources': [
                      {
                          'Type': 'AWS::WAF::SqlInjectionMatchSet',
                          'Values': ['arn:aws:waf::123456789012:sql-injection-match-set/your-match-set-id']
                      }
                  ]
              }
          ]
      )
  ```
