### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteRegexMatchSet event in AWS WAF refers to the action of deleting a regular expression (regex) match set. 
- A regex match set is a collection of regex patterns that are used to match against incoming web requests and identify potential security threats or malicious activity. 
- When the DeleteRegexMatchSet event is triggered, it indicates that a specific regex match set has been removed from the AWS WAF configuration, potentially impacting the ability to detect and block certain types of attacks or unwanted traffic patterns.

#### Example

- It is possible for security to be impacted with a DeleteRegexMatchSet event in AWS WAF if the wrong regex match set is deleted, leading to a misconfiguration or loss of protection against specific types of attacks.
- Remediation: To mitigate the impact of this event, it is recommended to have proper backup and version control mechanisms in place for WAF configurations. Additionally, regularly reviewing and testing changes before applying them in production can help identify any potential issues. In case of accidental deletion, the deleted regex match set can be restored using the AWS CLI command `aws waf-regional create-regex-match-set --name <name> --region <region>`.
