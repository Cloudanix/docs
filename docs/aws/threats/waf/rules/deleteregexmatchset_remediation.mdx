### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteRegexMatchSet event in AWS WAF refers to the action of deleting a regular expression (regex) match set. 
- A regex match set is a collection of regex patterns that are used to match against web request data in order to identify and block malicious or unwanted traffic. 
- When the DeleteRegexMatchSet event occurs, it means that a specific regex match set has been removed from the AWS WAF configuration, and any rules or conditions associated with that match set will no longer be applied.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteRegexMatchSet in AWS WAF, it could potentially lead to the unintentional removal of a regular expression match set that is crucial for protecting against specific types of web application attacks. This can result in a vulnerability in the application's security posture, allowing malicious traffic to bypass the WAF protections.

- Remediation Steps using AWS Console:
  1. Login to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS WAF service.
  2. In the left navigation pane, click on "Web ACLs" to view the list of available web access control lists.
  3. Identify the web ACL that contains the affected regex match set.
  4. Click on the web ACL name to open its details.
  5. In the "Rules" tab, locate the rule that references the regex match set.
  6. Click on the rule name to open its details.
  7. In the rule details, review the conditions and actions associated with the regex match set.
  8. If the regex match set is missing or deleted, click on the "Add condition" button to add a new condition.
  9. Select the appropriate condition type and configure the necessary parameters to recreate the regex match set.
  10. Save the changes to the rule and ensure that the web ACL is properly associated with the desired resources.
  11. Test the updated configuration to verify that the regex match set is functioning as expected and providing the necessary security protections.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteRegexMatchSet in AWS WAF, an example could be accidentally deleting a regex match set that is actively blocking malicious traffic patterns, resulting in a potential security breach.

To remediate this issue for AWS WAF using AWS CLI, the following steps can be taken:

1. Identify the deleted regex match set: Use the `list-regex-match-sets` command to retrieve a list of all regex match sets in AWS WAF. Look for the deleted match set in the response.

```
aws wafv2 list-regex-match-sets --scope CLOUDFRONT --region <region>
```

2. Restore the deleted regex match set: If the deleted regex match set is found, use the `create-regex-match-set` command to recreate it with the same rules and conditions.

```
aws wafv2 create-regex-match-set --name <match-set-name> --scope CLOUDFRONT --region <region>
```

3. Update the web ACL: Once the regex match set is restored, update the associated web ACL to include the newly created match set. Use the `update-web-acl` command to add the match set to the desired rule group within the web ACL.

```
aws wafv2 update-web-acl --name <web-acl-name> --scope CLOUDFRONT --default-action ALLOW --region <region> --rules '[
    {
        "Name": "RuleGroup",
        "Priority": 1,
        "Action": {
            "Allow": {}
        },
        "VisibilityConfig": {
            "SampledRequestsEnabled": true,
            "CloudWatchMetricsEnabled": true,
            "MetricName": "RuleGroup"
        },
        "Statement": {
            "RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement": {
                "ARN": "<regex-match-set-arn>",
                "FieldToMatch": {
                    "SingleHeader": {
                        "Name": "Host"
                    }
                },
                "TextTransformations": [
                    {
                        "Priority": 0,
                        "Type": "NONE"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
]'
```

Note: Replace `<region>`, `<match-set-name>`, `<web-acl-name>`, and `<regex-match-set-arn>` with the appropriate values specific to your environment.

#### Using Python

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteRegexMatchSet in AWS WAF, it could potentially lead to the unintended removal of a regular expression match set, which can result in a misconfiguration of the web application firewall rules. This can potentially allow malicious traffic to bypass the WAF protection and compromise the application.

- Remediation steps for AWS WAF using Python:
  1. First, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to interact with AWS WAF and the specific WAF resource.
  2. Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to create a script that performs the following actions:
     - Connect to the AWS WAF service using the appropriate credentials.
     - Retrieve the details of the regex match set that needs to be deleted.
     - Confirm the deletion by prompting the user for confirmation or by implementing a validation mechanism.
     - If confirmed, use the `delete_regex_match_set` method to delete the regex match set.
  3. Implement error handling and logging to capture any potential issues during the deletion process.

Python script example:
```python
import boto3

def delete_regex_match_set(match_set_id):
    waf_client = boto3.client('waf')

    try:
        response = waf_client.delete_regex_match_set(RegexMatchSetId=match_set_id)
        print("Regex match set deleted successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error deleting regex match set:", str(e))

# Usage
match_set_id = 'your-match-set-id'
delete_regex_match_set(match_set_id)
```
Please note that you need to replace `'your-match-set-id'` with the actual ID of the regex match set you want to delete.
