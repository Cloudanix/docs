### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteIPSet event in AWS WAF refers to the action of deleting an IP set, which is a collection of IP addresses or IP address ranges that are used to create rules for web application firewall (WAF) rulesets.
- This event indicates that an IP set has been removed from the WAF configuration, and any associated rules or conditions that reference this IP set will no longer be enforced.
- It is important to monitor this event as it can help track changes to the WAF configuration and ensure that the appropriate IP sets are being managed and updated as needed for effective security controls.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteIPSet event in AWS WAF:
   - If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the AWS account and deletes an IP set used in AWS WAF, it can lead to a potential security breach. This can allow malicious traffic to bypass the WAF rules and directly access the protected resources.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteIPSet event in AWS WAF:
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API activities, including the DeleteIPSet event. This will help in identifying any unauthorized access or deletion of IP sets.
   - Implement strict access controls and least privilege principles for AWS IAM users and roles. Ensure that only authorized personnel have the necessary permissions to modify or delete IP sets.
   - Regularly backup the IP sets and store them in a secure location. This will allow for quick restoration in case of accidental or malicious deletion.

3. AWS CLI command to restore a deleted IP set in AWS WAF:
   - To restore a deleted IP set in AWS WAF, you can use the `create-ip-set` command with the appropriate parameters. Here's an example:
     ```
     aws wafv2 create-ip-set --name <IP_SET_NAME> --scope <SCOPE> --addresses <LIST_OF_IP_ADDRESSES>
     ```
     Replace `<IP_SET_NAME>` with the desired name for the IP set, `<SCOPE>` with the appropriate scope (e.g., REGIONAL or CLOUDFRONT), and `<LIST_OF_IP_ADDRESSES>` with the IP addresses you want to include in the IP set.
