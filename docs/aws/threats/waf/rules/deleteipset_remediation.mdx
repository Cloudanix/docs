### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteIPSet event in AWS WAF refers to the action of deleting an IP set, which is a collection of IP addresses or IP address ranges that are used to create rules for web application firewall (WAF) rulesets.
- This event indicates that an administrator or user has initiated the deletion of an IP set, which could be done to remove outdated or unnecessary IP addresses from the WAF configuration.
- It is important to monitor this event to ensure that the deletion is intentional and authorized, as it can impact the effectiveness of WAF rules and the security of the protected web applications.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteIPSet in AWS WAF, an attacker could potentially delete an IP set that contains a list of trusted IP addresses, allowing them to bypass the WAF protection and gain unauthorized access to the application or resources behind it.

- Remediation steps using AWS console:
  1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS WAF console.
  2. In the navigation pane, choose "IP sets" under the "Web ACLs" section.
  3. Select the IP set that needs to be protected from deletion.
  4. Click on the "Edit IP set" button.
  5. In the "Edit IP set" page, scroll down to the "Permissions" section.
  6. Under the "Permissions" section, click on the "Add permissions" button.
  7. In the "Add permissions" dialog box, specify the IAM users or roles that should have permission to modify or delete the IP set.
  8. Choose the desired permissions for the selected users or roles (e.g., "Modify" or "Delete").
  9. Click on the "Add permissions" button to save the changes.
  10. Review the updated permissions for the IP set and ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions.
  11. Repeat these steps for any other IP sets that need protection from deletion.

Note: It is important to regularly review and update the permissions for IP sets to ensure that only authorized users or roles can modify or delete them. Additionally, enabling AWS CloudTrail logging can help in monitoring and auditing any changes made to the IP sets.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteIPSet in AWS WAF, an attacker could potentially delete an IP set that is being used to block malicious traffic, thereby allowing unauthorized access to the protected resources.

- Remediation steps using AWS CLI:
  1. First, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to manage AWS WAF resources.
  2. To remediate the security impact, you can recreate the deleted IP set using the AWS CLI. Retrieve the necessary information about the IP set, such as its name and the associated AWS WAF web ACL.
  3. Use the `create-ip-set` command to recreate the IP set, providing the required parameters such as the IP set name, IP addresses or CIDR ranges to include, and the associated web ACL.

Example CLI commands:
```
aws wafv2 create-ip-set --name <ip-set-name> --scope CLOUDFRONT --addresses <ip-addresses> --description <description> --tags <tags> --region <region>
```

Note: Replace `<ip-set-name>`, `<ip-addresses>`, `<description>`, `<tags>`, and `<region>` with the appropriate values for your environment.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with DeleteIPSet in AWS WAF:
   - If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the AWS account and deletes an IP set used in AWS WAF, it can result in a loss of protection against known malicious IP addresses. This can lead to an increased risk of DDoS attacks, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities.

2. Remediation for AWS WAF using Python:
   - To remediate the security impact of DeleteIPSet in AWS WAF using Python, you can implement a script that periodically checks the existence of the IP set and recreates it if it is found to be deleted. Here's an example Python script using the Boto3 library:

```python
import boto3

def recreate_ip_set(ip_set_id, ip_set_name, ip_set_type, ip_set_format, ip_set_content):
    waf_client = boto3.client('waf')

    try:
        response = waf_client.get_ip_set(IPSetId=ip_set_id)
        if response['IPSet']['IPSetId'] == ip_set_id:
            print("IP set already exists.")
            return
    except waf_client.exceptions.WAFNonexistentItemException:
        pass

    try:
        response = waf_client.create_ip_set(
            Name=ip_set_name,
            ChangeToken=waf_client.get_change_token()['ChangeToken'],
            IPSetDescriptors=[
                {
                    'Type': ip_set_type,
                    'Value': ip_set_content
                },
            ],
            IPAddressVersion='IPV4',
            Format=ip_set_format
        )
        print("IP set recreated successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Failed to recreate IP set:", str(e))

# Usage
recreate_ip_set('ip-set-id', 'ip-set-name', 'IPV4', 'TXT', '1.2.3.4/32')
```

This script checks if the specified IP set exists using the `get_ip_set` API. If the IP set is not found, it recreates it using the `create_ip_set` API. You need to provide the appropriate values for `ip_set_id`, `ip_set_name`, `ip_set_type`, `ip_set_format`, and `ip_set_content` based on your specific requirements.

Note: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform these actions in AWS WAF.
