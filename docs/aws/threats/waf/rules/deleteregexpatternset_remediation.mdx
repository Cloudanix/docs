### Event Information

- The DeleteRegexPatternSet event in AWS WAF refers to the action of deleting a regex pattern set within the Web Application Firewall (WAF) service.
- Regex pattern sets are used in WAF to define regular expressions that match against the request body, URI, or query string of incoming web requests.
- When the DeleteRegexPatternSet event occurs, it means that a specific regex pattern set has been removed from the WAF configuration, and any rules or conditions associated with that pattern set will no longer be enforced.


### Examples

1. Inadvertent deletion of critical regex patterns: If security is impacted with DeleteRegexPatternSet in AWS WAF, one example could be the accidental deletion of critical regex patterns that are used to block specific types of malicious traffic. This could result in the WAF allowing potentially harmful requests to pass through, compromising the security of the application or infrastructure.

2. Loss of protection against specific attack vectors: Another example could be the removal of regex patterns that are specifically designed to block known attack vectors, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). Deleting a regex pattern set without proper analysis and understanding of its impact could leave the application vulnerable to these types of attacks.

3. Disruption of application functionality: Deleting a regex pattern set without considering the impact on the application's functionality can also lead to security issues. For example, if a regex pattern set is used to block certain user input that is considered unsafe, deleting it without proper testing could result in legitimate user input being blocked, causing disruptions or false positives in the application's functionality.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Inadvertent deletion of critical regex patterns can be remediated in AWS WAF using the AWS console by following these steps:

- Step 1: Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS WAF service.
- Step 2: Select the appropriate WAF web ACL that contains the regex pattern set that was deleted.
- Step 3: In the web ACL settings, click on the "Rules" tab.
- Step 4: Identify the rule that references the deleted regex pattern set.
- Step 5: Edit the rule and replace the deleted regex pattern set with a new one or an existing one that provides similar protection.
- Step 6: Save the changes to the rule and ensure that the web ACL is updated.

By following these steps, the inadvertent deletion of critical regex patterns can be remediated by restoring the protection provided by the regex pattern set and ensuring that the appropriate rules are updated accordingly.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate the inadvertent deletion of critical regex patterns in AWS WAF using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

- First, identify the deleted regex pattern set by checking the AWS WAF logs or event history.
- Once identified, retrieve the details of the deleted regex pattern set using the `get-regex-pattern-set` command with the appropriate parameters, such as the name or ID of the pattern set.
- After retrieving the details, recreate the regex pattern set using the `create-regex-pattern-set` command, providing the necessary parameters like the name, description, and the regex patterns themselves.
- Finally, associate the newly created regex pattern set with the appropriate web ACL or rule group using the `update-web-acl` or `update-rule-group` command, respectively.

2. If you have lost protection against specific attack vectors due to the removal of regex patterns in AWS WAF, you can remediate it using the following AWS CLI commands:

- Identify the attack vectors that are no longer protected by checking the logs or event history.
- Retrieve the details of the previously used regex pattern set using the `get-regex-pattern-set` command.
- Analyze the removed regex patterns and their associated attack vectors.
- Recreate the regex pattern set using the `create-regex-pattern-set` command, including the missing regex patterns.
- Associate the newly created regex pattern set with the appropriate web ACL or rule group using the `update-web-acl` or `update-rule-group` command.

3. To remediate the disruption of regular expression-based rules caused by the deletion of a regex pattern set in AWS WAF, you can take the following steps:

- Identify the disrupted rules by reviewing the logs or event history.
- Retrieve the details of the deleted regex pattern set using the `get-regex-pattern-set` command.
- Analyze the impact of the deleted regex patterns on the existing rules.
- Recreate the regex pattern set using the `create-regex-pattern-set` command, ensuring to include the necessary regex patterns.
- Update the affected rules to use the newly created regex pattern set using the appropriate AWS CLI command, such as `update-rule` or `update-rule-group`.

#### Using Python

To remediate the inadvertent deletion of critical regex patterns in AWS WAF, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to automate the process. Here's an example of a Python script that can help:

1. Retrieve the deleted regex pattern set:
```python
import boto3

waf_client = boto3.client('waf')

response = waf_client.list_regex_pattern_sets()

deleted_pattern_set_id = '<deleted_pattern_set_id>'

deleted_pattern_set = None

for pattern_set in response['RegexPatternSets']:
    if pattern_set['RegexPatternSetId'] == deleted_pattern_set_id:
        deleted_pattern_set = pattern_set
        break

if deleted_pattern_set is None:
    print("Deleted regex pattern set not found.")
else:
    print("Deleted regex pattern set:", deleted_pattern_set)
```

2. Restore the deleted regex pattern set:
```python
import boto3

waf_client = boto3.client('waf')

restored_pattern_set_id = '<restored_pattern_set_id>'

response = waf_client.update_regex_pattern_set(
    RegexPatternSetId=restored_pattern_set_id,
    Updates=[
        {
            'Action': 'INSERT',
            'RegexPatternString': '<regex_pattern_string>',
        },
    ]
)

print("Regex pattern set restored successfully.")
```

3. Validate the restoration:
```python
import boto3

waf_client = boto3.client('waf')

restored_pattern_set_id = '<restored_pattern_set_id>'

response = waf_client.get_regex_pattern_set(
    RegexPatternSetId=restored_pattern_set_id
)

restored_pattern_set = response['RegexPatternSet']

print("Restored regex pattern set:", restored_pattern_set)
```

Please note that you need to replace `<deleted_pattern_set_id>`, `<restored_pattern_set_id>`, and `<regex_pattern_string>` with the appropriate values for your scenario.
