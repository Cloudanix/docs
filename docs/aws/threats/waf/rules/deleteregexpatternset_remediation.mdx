### Event Information

- The DeleteRegexPatternSet event in AWS WAF refers to the action of deleting a regex pattern set within the Web Application Firewall (WAF) service.
- Regex pattern sets are used in WAF to define regular expressions that match against the request body, URI, or query string of incoming web requests.
- When the DeleteRegexPatternSet event occurs, it means that a specific regex pattern set has been removed from the WAF configuration, and any rules or conditions associated with that pattern set will no longer be enforced.


### Examples

1. Inadvertent deletion of important regex patterns: If security is impacted with DeleteRegexPatternSet in AWS WAF, one example could be the accidental deletion of important regex patterns that are used to block specific types of malicious requests. This could result in a decrease in the effectiveness of the WAF in protecting against those specific threats.

2. Loss of historical data: Another example could be the loss of historical data associated with the deleted regex pattern set. This could impact security analysis and incident response efforts, as the ability to analyze past patterns of attacks or identify trends may be compromised.

3. Increased risk of false positives: Deleting a regex pattern set without proper analysis and testing could lead to an increased risk of false positives. This means that legitimate requests may be incorrectly blocked, impacting the availability and usability of the protected application or service. It is important to carefully evaluate the impact of deleting a regex pattern set and consider the potential consequences on security before proceeding.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Inadvertent deletion of critical regex patterns can be remediated in AWS WAF using the AWS console by following these steps:

- Step 1: Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS WAF service.
- Step 2: Select the appropriate WAF web ACL that contains the regex pattern set that was deleted.
- Step 3: In the web ACL settings, click on the "Rules" tab.
- Step 4: Identify the rule that references the deleted regex pattern set.
- Step 5: Edit the rule and replace the deleted regex pattern set with a new one or an existing one that provides similar protection.
- Step 6: Save the changes to the rule and ensure that the web ACL is updated.

By following these steps, the inadvertent deletion of critical regex patterns can be remediated by restoring the necessary protection to the application or infrastructure. It is important to regularly review and backup regex pattern sets to prevent accidental deletion and ensure the security of the AWS WAF configuration.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate the inadvertent deletion of critical regex patterns in AWS WAF, you can use the AWS CLI commands to restore the deleted pattern set. First, identify the ID of the deleted pattern set using the `list-regex-pattern-sets` command. Once you have the ID, you can use the `create-regex-pattern-set` command to recreate the pattern set with the necessary regex patterns.

Example CLI commands:
```
aws wafv2 list-regex-pattern-sets --scope CLOUDFRONT --region <region> --query 'RegexPatternSets[?Name==`<pattern_set_name>`].Id'
aws wafv2 create-regex-pattern-set --name <pattern_set_name> --scope CLOUDFRONT --region <region> --description "<description>" --regular-expression-list "RegexString=<regex_pattern>"
```

2. If there is a loss of protection against specific attack vectors due to the removal of regex patterns in AWS WAF, you can restore the protection by re-adding the necessary regex patterns to the pattern set. Use the `update-regex-pattern-set` command to add the missing regex patterns to the pattern set.

Example CLI command:
```
aws wafv2 update-regex-pattern-set --name <pattern_set_name> --scope CLOUDFRONT --region <region> --description "<description>" --regular-expression-list "RegexString=<regex_pattern>"
```

3. To avoid disruption of regular expression-based rules in AWS WAF, it is important to carefully assess the impact before deleting a regex pattern set. If a disruption occurs, you can restore the previous state by reverting the changes made to the regex pattern set. Use the `update-regex-pattern-set` command to add back the deleted regex patterns or use the `create-regex-pattern-set` command to recreate the pattern set with the original regex patterns.

Example CLI commands:
```
aws wafv2 update-regex-pattern-set --name <pattern_set_name> --scope CLOUDFRONT --region <region> --description "<description>" --regular-expression-list "RegexString=<regex_pattern>"
aws wafv2 create-regex-pattern-set --name <pattern_set_name> --scope CLOUDFRONT --region <region> --description "<description>" --regular-expression-list "RegexString=<regex_pattern>"
```

#### Using Python

To remediate the inadvertent deletion of critical regex patterns in AWS WAF using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement version control: Maintain a version control system for your regex pattern sets. This will allow you to easily revert to a previous version in case of accidental deletion.

2. Regularly backup regex pattern sets: Create automated scripts using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to regularly backup your regex pattern sets. These backups can be stored in a secure location, such as an S3 bucket.

3. Implement deletion confirmation prompts: Modify your existing Python scripts to include confirmation prompts before deleting regex pattern sets. This will add an extra layer of protection and prevent accidental deletions.

Here's an example of a Python script that prompts for confirmation before deleting a regex pattern set in AWS WAF:

```python
import boto3

def delete_regex_pattern_set(waf_client, regex_pattern_set_id):
    confirm = input("Are you sure you want to delete the regex pattern set? (yes/no): ")
    if confirm.lower() == "yes":
        waf_client.delete_regex_pattern_set(RegexPatternSetId=regex_pattern_set_id)
        print("Regex pattern set deleted successfully.")
    else:
        print("Deletion cancelled.")

# Initialize AWS WAF client
waf_client = boto3.client('waf')

# Specify the ID of the regex pattern set to be deleted
regex_pattern_set_id = 'your-regex-pattern-set-id'

# Call the function to delete the regex pattern set
delete_regex_pattern_set(waf_client, regex_pattern_set_id)
```

Please note that you need to have the necessary AWS credentials configured for the Boto3 library to work correctly.
