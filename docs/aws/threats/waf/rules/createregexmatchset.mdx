### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The CreateRegexMatchSet event in AWS WAF refers to the action of creating a new regular expression (regex) match set.
- A regex match set is a collection of regular expressions that are used to match patterns in web requests.
- This event indicates that a new regex match set has been created, which can be used in WAF rules to identify and block malicious or unwanted traffic based on specific patterns or criteria.

#### Example

- It is possible for security to be impacted with a CreateRegexMatchSet event in AWS WAF if the regular expression pattern used in the match set is not properly configured or if it allows for malicious input to bypass the WAF rules.
- Remediation: To mitigate this issue, you can follow these steps:
  1. Review the regular expression pattern used in the match set to ensure it is correctly defined and does not have any vulnerabilities.
  2. Test the regular expression pattern against known malicious input to verify its effectiveness.
  3. Monitor the WAF logs and set up alerts to detect any potential bypass attempts or suspicious activity.

Example AWS CLI command to create a regex match set:
```
aws waf create-regex-match-set --name <match-set-name> --region <region>
```

Example AWS CLI command to update a regex match set with regular expression patterns:
```
aws waf update-regex-match-set --regex-match-set-id <match-set-id> --updates '[{"Action": "INSERT", "RegexMatchTuple": {"FieldToMatch": {"Type": "URI"}, "TextTransformation": "NONE", "RegexPatternSetId": "<regex-pattern-set-id>"}}]' --region <region>
```
