### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteGeoMatchSet event in AWS WAF refers to the action of deleting a Geo Match Set, which is a collection of geographic locations that are used to create rules for AWS WAF.
- This event indicates that a Geo Match Set has been removed from the WAF configuration, and any associated rules or conditions using this Geo Match Set will no longer be active.
- It is important to monitor this event to ensure that the deletion of a Geo Match Set does not impact the effectiveness of your WAF rules and protections, and to track any changes made to the WAF configuration.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteGeoMatchSet event in AWS WAF:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and deletes a GeoMatchSet, it can lead to a potential security breach. The GeoMatchSet contains rules that allow or block traffic based on the geographic location of the request. Deleting this GeoMatchSet can remove the protection against specific geographic regions, potentially allowing malicious traffic from those regions.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteGeoMatchSet event:
   - Regularly monitor and review AWS CloudTrail logs to detect any unauthorized access or modifications to WAF resources.
   - Implement strong access control measures, such as using IAM policies, to restrict access to WAF resources only to authorized users.
   - Enable AWS WAF logging and integrate it with a centralized logging and monitoring solution to receive real-time alerts and notifications for any changes or deletions of WAF resources.

3. AWS CLI command for listing GeoMatchSets and their associated resources:
   ```
   aws wafv2 list-geo-match-sets --scope CLOUDFRONT --region <region>
   ```
   This command will list all the GeoMatchSets in the specified region for AWS WAFv2 deployed with CloudFront. Review the output to ensure that the expected GeoMatchSets are present and no unauthorized deletions have occurred.
