### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteWebACL event in awsrealtime for WAF refers to the action of deleting a Web Application Firewall (WAF) Access Control List (ACL) in AWS.
- This event indicates that a specific WebACL, which is used to define rules and conditions for filtering and blocking malicious traffic to web applications, has been deleted.
- The DeleteWebACL event can be useful for monitoring and auditing purposes, allowing administrators to track changes made to WAF configurations and ensure the security of their web applications.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteWebACL event in AWS WAF:
   - Accidental deletion: A user with sufficient permissions may accidentally delete a WebACL, resulting in the loss of security rules and configurations associated with the WebACL. This can leave the application vulnerable to attacks.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteWebACL event:
   - Regular backups: Take regular backups of the WebACL configuration using AWS CLI or SDKs. This ensures that even if the WebACL is accidentally deleted, it can be restored quickly.
   - Implement strict IAM policies: Limit the permissions of users who can delete WebACLs. Follow the principle of least privilege and grant only the necessary permissions to avoid accidental deletions.
   - Enable versioning: Enable versioning for the WebACLs to maintain a history of changes. This allows you to roll back to a previous version in case of accidental deletions.

Example AWS CLI command to create a backup of a WebACL:
```
aws wafv2 create-web-acl --name MyWebACL --scope REGIONAL --default-action ALLOW --rules file://rules.json --tags Key=Backup,Value=Original
```

Note: The above command creates a backup of a WebACL named "MyWebACL" with the specified rules and tags.

Example AWS CLI command to restore a WebACL from a backup:
```
aws wafv2 create-web-acl --name MyWebACL-Restored --scope REGIONAL --default-action ALLOW --rules file://rules.json --tags Key=Backup,Value=Restored
```

Note: The above command restores a WebACL named "MyWebACL-Restored" from a backup file named "rules.json".
