### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteWebACL event in AWS for WAF refers to the action of deleting a Web Application Firewall (WAF) Access Control List (ACL).
- When this event occurs, it means that the specified WebACL has been successfully removed from the AWS WAF service.
- This event is typically triggered when an administrator or an automated process initiates the deletion of a WebACL to remove the associated access control rules and configurations.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteWebACL in AWS WAF, it could potentially lead to the removal of a web application firewall (WAF) access control list (ACL) that is protecting a web application. This can result in unauthorized access, increased vulnerability to attacks, and potential data breaches.

- Remediation steps using AWS console:
  1. Login to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS WAF service.
  2. In the left navigation pane, click on "Web ACLs" to view the list of existing web ACLs.
  3. Identify the web ACL that was mistakenly deleted using the "Web ACL Name" or other relevant identifiers.
  4. Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu for the identified web ACL and select "Restore Deleted Web ACL".
  5. Review the details of the deleted web ACL and click on the "Restore" button to restore it.
  6. Once the web ACL is restored, review its configuration and ensure that it is properly associated with the desired resources and rules.
  7. Test the restored web ACL to verify that the security impact has been remediated and the desired protection is in place.

Note: It is important to regularly backup and monitor the configuration of AWS WAF to prevent accidental deletions and ensure the security of web applications.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteWebACL in AWS WAF, it could potentially lead to the removal of a web application firewall (WAF) access control list (ACL) that protects against malicious web traffic. This can result in unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security vulnerabilities.

- Remediation steps using AWS CLI:
  1. First, ensure you have the necessary permissions to manage AWS WAF resources.
  2. To remediate the impact of DeleteWebACL, you can recreate the deleted web ACL using the AWS CLI. Retrieve the necessary information about the deleted web ACL, such as its name, rules, and associated resources.
  3. Use the `create-web-acl` command to recreate the web ACL, providing the required parameters such as the name, default action, and rules. Make sure to configure the ACL with appropriate rules to protect against known threats and vulnerabilities.

Example CLI commands:
```
aws wafv2 create-web-acl --name <new-web-acl-name> --default-action <default-action> --rules <rules>
```

Note: Replace `<new-web-acl-name>`, `<default-action>`, and `<rules>` with the appropriate values for your environment.

#### Using Python

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteWebACL in AWS WAF, an attacker could potentially delete a Web Application Firewall (WAF) Access Control List (ACL) that is protecting a web application. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security vulnerabilities.

- Remediation for AWS WAF using Python:
  1. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have permissions to delete WebACLs. This can be achieved by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to the `waf:DeleteWebACL` action.
  
  ```python
  import boto3

  def restrict_delete_webacl():
      client = boto3.client('waf')
      response = client.put_permission_policy(
          ResourceArn='arn:aws:waf:us-west-2:123456789012:webacl/abcdabcd-abcd-abcd-abcd-abcdabcdabcd',
          Policy='{"Version": "2012-10-17","Statement": [{"Effect": "Deny","Principal": "*","Action": "waf:DeleteWebACL","Resource": "arn:aws:waf:us-west-2:123456789012:webacl/abcdabcd-abcd-abcd-abcd-abcdabcdabcd"}]}'
      )
      print(response)
  ```
  
  2. Enable AWS CloudTrail: AWS CloudTrail provides detailed logs of API activity, including WAF API calls. By enabling CloudTrail, you can monitor and audit any attempts to delete WebACLs. You can also set up CloudWatch Events to trigger automated responses, such as sending notifications or blocking the deletion.
  
  ```python
  import boto3

  def enable_cloudtrail():
      client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
      response = client.start_logging(
          Name='my-cloudtrail',
      )
      print(response)
  ```
  
  3. Implement backup and restore mechanisms: Regularly backup your WebACL configurations and rules to ensure quick restoration in case of accidental deletion. You can use the AWS WAF API to export and import WebACL configurations programmatically.
  
  ```python
  import boto3

  def export_webacl():
      client = boto3.client('waf')
      response = client.get_web_acl(
          WebACLId='abcdabcd-abcd-abcd-abcd-abcdabcdabcd'
      )
      with open('webacl.json', 'w') as f:
          f.write(response['WebACL']['Rules'])
      print('WebACL exported successfully.')

  def import_webacl():
      client = boto3.client('waf')
      with open('webacl.json', 'r') as f:
          rules = f.read()
      response = client.create_web_acl(
          Name='restored-webacl',
          DefaultAction={'Type': 'ALLOW'},
          Rules=rules
      )
      print(response)
  ```
