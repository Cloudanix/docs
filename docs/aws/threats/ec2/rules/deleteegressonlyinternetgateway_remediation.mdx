### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteEgressOnlyInternetGateway event in AWS EC2 refers to the deletion of an egress-only internet gateway.
- An egress-only internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows outbound communication over IPv6 from instances in a VPC to the internet, while preventing inbound communication from the internet.
- This event indicates that the egress-only internet gateway has been successfully deleted, removing the associated outbound IPv6 connectivity for instances in the VPC.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteEgressOnlyInternetGateway event in AWS EC2:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and deletes the Egress Only Internet Gateway (EOIG), it can disrupt the outbound internet connectivity for the EC2 instances within the VPC. This can potentially lead to a security breach as the instances may lose the ability to communicate with necessary external services or updates.

2. Remediation for the security impact:
   - Regularly monitor and review the AWS CloudTrail logs to identify any unauthorized access or modifications to the EOIG.
   - Implement strong access controls and follow the principle of least privilege to restrict access to the EOIG and other critical resources.
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the AWS account to add an extra layer of security.

3. AWS CLI command for checking the status of the EOIG and restoring it if deleted:
   - To check the status of the EOIG:
     ```
     aws ec2 describe-egress-only-internet-gateways --egress-only-internet-gateway-ids <EOIG_ID>
     ```

   - To restore a deleted EOIG:
     ```
     aws ec2 create-egress-only-internet-gateway --vpc-id <VPC_ID>
     ```
