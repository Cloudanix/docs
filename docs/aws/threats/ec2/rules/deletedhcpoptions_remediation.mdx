### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteDhcpOptions event in AWS for EC2 refers to the deletion of a DHCP options set associated with a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
- DHCP options sets in AWS EC2 are used to configure network settings for instances within a VPC, such as DNS servers, domain names, and NTP servers.
- When the DeleteDhcpOptions event occurs, it means that the DHCP options set has been successfully removed from the VPC, and any instances using that DHCP options set will no longer have the associated network configurations.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteDhcpOptions in AWS for EC2, it could potentially lead to network connectivity issues for the affected instances. This is because DHCP options provide important network configuration information, such as DNS servers and domain names, to EC2 instances. Deleting DHCP options can result in instances losing access to necessary network resources.

- Remediation Steps using AWS Console:
  1. Login to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.
  2. In the EC2 Dashboard, click on "DHCP options sets" under the "NETWORK & SECURITY" section in the left-hand menu.
  3. Identify the DHCP options set that was deleted or impacted and note down its name or ID.
  4. Click on "Create DHCP options set" to create a new DHCP options set with the necessary configuration.
  5. Provide a name for the new DHCP options set and configure the required options, such as DNS servers and domain names.
  6. Save the new DHCP options set.
  7. Once the new DHCP options set is created, go to the "VPC Dashboard" and select the VPC where the impacted instances are located.
  8. Click on "Actions" and then "Edit DHCP options set".
  9. Select the newly created DHCP options set from the dropdown menu and save the changes.
  10. Verify that the instances in the affected VPC now have the correct DHCP options by checking their network configuration.

Note: It is important to regularly backup and document the DHCP options sets to avoid accidental deletion or misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteDhcpOptions in AWS for EC2, an example could be accidentally deleting the DHCP options set that is associated with a VPC. This can lead to connectivity issues for instances within the VPC, as DHCP options provide important network configuration information such as DNS servers and domain names.

- Remediation: To remediate this issue for AWS EC2 using AWS CLI, you can recreate the DHCP options set and associate it with the affected VPC. Here are the CLI commands:

1. Retrieve the details of the deleted DHCP options set:
```
aws ec2 describe-dhcp-options --dhcp-options-ids <deleted-dhcp-options-id>
```

2. Create a new DHCP options set with the retrieved details:
```
aws ec2 create-dhcp-options --cli-input-json file://<path-to-json-file-with-retrieved-details>
```

3. Associate the new DHCP options set with the affected VPC:
```
aws ec2 associate-dhcp-options --dhcp-options-id <new-dhcp-options-id> --vpc-id <vpc-id>
```

Note: Replace `<deleted-dhcp-options-id>`, `<path-to-json-file-with-retrieved-details>`, `<new-dhcp-options-id>`, and `<vpc-id>` with the appropriate values specific to your environment.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with DeleteDhcpOptions in AWS EC2:
   - If the DeleteDhcpOptions action is misused or unauthorized, it can lead to the deletion of DHCP options sets in your VPC. This can disrupt network connectivity and cause instances to lose their ability to obtain IP addresses and other network configuration settings.

2. Remediation for AWS EC2 using Python:
   - To remediate the security impact of unauthorized DeleteDhcpOptions action in AWS EC2, you can implement a preventive measure by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. Here's an example Python script to create an IAM policy that restricts the DeleteDhcpOptions action:

```python
import boto3

def create_dhcp_options_policy():
    iam = boto3.client('iam')
    
    policy_document = {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Deny",
                "Action": "ec2:DeleteDhcpOptions",
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
    
    response = iam.create_policy(
        PolicyName='RestrictDeleteDhcpOptions',
        PolicyDocument=json.dumps(policy_document)
    )
    
    return response['Policy']['Arn']

policy_arn = create_dhcp_options_policy()
print(f"Created IAM policy: {policy_arn}")
```

3. Attach the IAM policy to the appropriate IAM user, group, or role to enforce the restriction on the DeleteDhcpOptions action. This will ensure that only authorized entities can perform this action in your AWS EC2 environment.
