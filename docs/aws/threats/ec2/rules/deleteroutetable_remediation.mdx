### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteRouteTable event in AWS for EC2 refers to the action of deleting a route table within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in the AWS environment.
- When this event occurs, it means that the specified route table has been successfully removed from the VPC, and any associated routes and associations with subnets have been terminated.
- This event is typically triggered when an administrator or automated process initiates the deletion of a route table using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or API.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteRouteTable in AWS for EC2, it can lead to the loss of network connectivity for instances associated with the deleted route table. This can result in potential service disruptions or unauthorized access to resources.

- Remediation Steps using AWS Console:
  1. Login to the AWS Management Console.
  2. Navigate to the EC2 service.
  3. Select the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) where the impacted EC2 instances are located.
  4. Click on "Route Tables" in the left navigation pane.
  5. Identify the deleted route table from the list.
  6. Click on the deleted route table to view its details.
  7. Click on the "Actions" button and select "Create Route Table" from the dropdown menu.
  8. Configure the new route table by adding the necessary routes and associating it with the appropriate subnets.
  9. Once the new route table is created, select the EC2 instances that were impacted by the deletion of the route table.
  10. Click on "Actions" and select "Change Route Table Association" from the dropdown menu.
  11. Associate the instances with the newly created route table.
  12. Verify the network connectivity and ensure that the instances are functioning properly.

Note: It is recommended to regularly backup and document the configuration of route tables to avoid accidental deletions and ensure quick recovery in case of any security impact.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteRouteTable in AWS for EC2, it could lead to the loss of network connectivity for instances associated with that route table. This can result in service disruption or unauthorized access to resources.

- Remediation steps using AWS CLI:
  1. Identify the affected route table: `aws ec2 describe-route-tables --query 'RouteTables[?RouteTableId==<route_table_id>]'`
  2. Create a new route table: `aws ec2 create-route-table --vpc-id <vpc_id>`
  3. Associate the new route table with the affected subnet(s): `aws ec2 associate-route-table --subnet-id <subnet_id> --route-table-id <new_route_table_id>`

Note: Replace `<route_table_id>`, `<vpc_id>`, `<subnet_id>`, and `<new_route_table_id>` with the actual values specific to your environment.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with DeleteRouteTable in AWS EC2:
   - If a route table is deleted accidentally or maliciously using the DeleteRouteTable API call, it can disrupt network connectivity for the associated subnets and instances. This can lead to service interruptions and potential security vulnerabilities.

2. Remediation for AWS EC2 using Python:
   - To remediate the security impact of accidentally deleting a route table in AWS EC2, you can implement a script that performs the following steps:
     - Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to create a backup of the route table before deletion.
     - Implement a confirmation mechanism to prevent accidental deletions, such as prompting for user confirmation or implementing a multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirement.
     - Implement proper access controls and permissions to restrict the DeleteRouteTable API call to authorized users or roles.
     - Regularly monitor and audit the usage of the DeleteRouteTable API call to detect any unauthorized or suspicious activities.

   Here's an example Python script that demonstrates the above steps:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def backup_route_table(route_table_id):
       ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
       response = ec2_client.create_route_table_backup(
           RouteTableId=route_table_id,
           BackupName=f'Backup-{route_table_id}'
       )
       print(f"Backup created: {response['BackupId']}")

   def delete_route_table(route_table_id):
       ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
       response = ec2_client.delete_route_table(
           RouteTableId=route_table_id
       )
       print(f"Route table deleted: {route_table_id}")

   def confirm_deletion():
       confirmation = input("Are you sure you want to delete the route table? (yes/no): ")
       return confirmation.lower() == 'yes'

   def main():
       route_table_id = 'your-route-table-id'

       if confirm_deletion():
           backup_route_table(route_table_id)
           delete_route_table(route_table_id)
       else:
           print("Deletion cancelled.")

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       main()
   ```

   Note: This is a basic example and should be customized based on your specific requirements and environment.
