### Event Information

- The DeleteCustomerGateway event in AWS for EC2 refers to the action of deleting a customer gateway resource.
- A customer gateway is a physical device or software application on the customer's side of the VPN connection. It represents the customer's gateway to the AWS network.
- When the DeleteCustomerGateway event occurs, it means that the customer gateway resource has been successfully deleted from the AWS environment, terminating the associated VPN connection.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with DeleteCustomerGateway in AWS for EC2, one example could be an unauthorized user gaining access to the AWS account and deleting customer gateways without proper authorization. This could lead to disruption of network connectivity and potential data breaches.

2. Misconfiguration: Another example could be a misconfiguration in the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, where a user or role is granted excessive permissions to delete customer gateways. This could result in accidental or intentional deletion of gateways, compromising the security of the network infrastructure.

3. Insider threat: A third example could be an insider threat scenario, where a disgruntled employee or contractor with legitimate access to the AWS account intentionally deletes customer gateways to disrupt network connectivity or cause data loss. This highlights the importance of implementing proper access controls, monitoring, and auditing mechanisms to detect and prevent such malicious actions.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion of customer gateways in AWS EC2 using the AWS console, you can follow these steps:

1. Review and update IAM policies: 
   - Access the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console.
   - Identify the IAM policies associated with the user or role that has the ability to delete customer gateways.
   - Review the permissions granted in these policies and ensure that they are limited to only necessary actions.
   - Remove any excessive permissions that could potentially allow unauthorized deletion of customer gateways.

2. Enable AWS CloudTrail:
   - Access the AWS CloudTrail console.
   - Create a new trail or modify an existing one to capture API events related to customer gateway deletion.
   - Configure the trail to send logs to an S3 bucket or CloudWatch Logs for analysis and monitoring.
   - Enable CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual or suspicious activity related to customer gateway deletion.

3. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA):
   - Access the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console.
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users and roles with the ability to delete customer gateways.
   - Configure MFA to require an additional authentication factor, such as a physical token or virtual MFA device, in addition to the user's password.
   - This adds an extra layer of security and reduces the risk of unauthorized deletion by compromised credentials.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of customer gateways in AWS EC2 and enhance the overall security of your network infrastructure.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of customer gateways in AWS EC2, you can take the following steps using AWS CLI commands:

- Enable AWS CloudTrail: CloudTrail provides detailed logs of API activity in your AWS account, including the deletion of customer gateways. By enabling CloudTrail, you can monitor and track any unauthorized deletion attempts. Use the following command to enable CloudTrail:

```
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <trail-name> --s3-bucket-name <bucket-name> --is-multi-region-trail
```

- Implement IAM Policies: Ensure that proper IAM policies are in place to restrict access to the `DeleteCustomerGateway` API. Only authorized users or roles should have permissions to perform this action. Use the following command to create an IAM policy:

```
aws iam create-policy --policy-name <policy-name> --policy-document file://policy.json
```

- Enable AWS Config: AWS Config allows you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. By enabling AWS Config, you can detect and remediate any misconfigurations that may lead to unauthorized deletion of customer gateways. Use the following command to enable AWS Config:

```
aws configservice put-configuration-recorder --configuration-recorder-name <recorder-name> --recording-group allSupported
```

2. Misconfiguration: To remediate misconfigurations in AWS IAM policies that grant excessive permissions to delete customer gateways, you can follow these steps using AWS CLI commands:

- Review IAM Policies: Identify the IAM policies that grant the `DeleteCustomerGateway` permission and review their configurations. Ensure that only necessary users or roles have this permission and remove any excessive access. Use the following command to list IAM policies:

```
aws iam list-policies
```

- Update IAM Policies: Modify the IAM policies to remove the `DeleteCustomerGateway` permission from unauthorized users or roles. Use the following command to update an IAM policy:

```
aws iam update-policy --policy-arn <policy-arn> --policy-document file://updated-policy.json
```

- Test IAM Policies: Validate the updated IAM policies by testing them with different user or role scenarios. Ensure that only authorized entities can perform the `DeleteCustomerGateway` action. Use the following command to simulate IAM policy evaluation:

```
aws iam simulate-custom-policy --policy-input-list file://policy-simulation.json
```

3. Insider threat: To mitigate the risk of insider threats deleting customer gateways in AWS EC2, you can implement the following measures using AWS CLI commands:

- Implement Least Privilege: Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions to users or roles. Grant only the necessary permissions required for their job responsibilities and regularly review and revoke unnecessary access. Use the following command to create an IAM user with limited permissions:

```
aws iam create-user --user-name <user-name>
```

- Enable AWS CloudTrail: Enable CloudTrail to monitor and log all API activity in your AWS account. Regularly review the CloudTrail logs to detect any suspicious or unauthorized actions, including the deletion of customer gateways. Use the following command to enable CloudTrail:

```
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <trail-name> --s3-bucket-name <bucket-name> --is-multi-region-trail
```

- Implement User Behavior Analytics: Utilize AWS services like Amazon GuardDuty or third-party solutions to analyze user behavior and detect any abnormal or malicious activities. Set up alerts and notifications to promptly respond to any insider threat incidents. Use the following command to enable Amazon GuardDuty:

```
aws guardduty create-detector --enable
```

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of customer gateways in AWS EC2 using Python scripts, you can implement the following steps:

- Regularly monitor and analyze CloudTrail logs to detect any unauthorized API calls related to customer gateway deletion.
- Create a Python script that retrieves CloudTrail logs and filters them based on the API call "DeleteCustomerGateway".
- Implement logic in the script to identify any unauthorized users or roles making these API calls.
- Set up notifications or alerts to notify the appropriate personnel when unauthorized deletion attempts are detected.
- Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AWS accounts to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access.
- Regularly review and update IAM policies to ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete customer gateways.

2. Misconfiguration: To remediate misconfigurations in AWS IAM policies that grant excessive permissions to delete customer gateways, you can use Python scripts in the following way:
