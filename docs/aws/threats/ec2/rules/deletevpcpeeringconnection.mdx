### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteVpcPeeringConnection event in AWS EC2 refers to the deletion of a VPC peering connection between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).
- This event indicates that the peering connection has been successfully removed, and the VPCs are no longer able to communicate with each other using the peering connection.
- It is important to note that deleting a VPC peering connection does not delete the VPCs themselves, but only terminates the connection between them.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user or malicious actor triggers a DeleteVpcPeeringConnection event in AWS EC2, it can potentially lead to the following security issues:
   - Unauthorized access: The deletion of a VPC peering connection can result in unauthorized access to resources within the affected VPC. This can allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive data or compromise the security of the VPC.
   - Network disruption: Deleting a VPC peering connection can disrupt network connectivity between the affected VPC and the peered VPCs, potentially impacting the availability of services and applications.

2. Remediation steps:
   - Implement strict access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have permissions to delete VPC peering connections. Use IAM policies to restrict access to the necessary individuals or roles.
   - Enable CloudTrail logging: Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture and log all API calls related to VPC peering connections. This will help in identifying any unauthorized or suspicious activities.
   - Regularly review and monitor VPC peering connections: Regularly review and monitor the VPC peering connections in your AWS account. This will help in detecting any unexpected deletions and taking appropriate actions.

3. AWS CLI command for listing VPC peering connections:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-vpc-peering-connections
   ```

   AWS CLI command for deleting a VPC peering connection:
   ```
   aws ec2 delete-vpc-peering-connection --vpc-peering-connection-id <peering-connection-id>
   ```

   Note: Replace `<peering-connection-id>` with the actual ID of the VPC peering connection you want to delete.
