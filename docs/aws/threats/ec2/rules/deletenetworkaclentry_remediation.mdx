### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteNetworkAclEntry event in awsrealtime for EC2 refers to the action of deleting a specific entry from a network access control list (ACL) in AWS.
- Network ACLs act as a virtual firewall for controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level in AWS VPCs.

   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account or EC2 instance, they can potentially delete a network ACL entry that allows or denies specific traffic. This can lead to unauthorized access or the bypassing of security controls, compromising the security of the EC2 instance or the entire network.

2. Remediation steps for security impact caused by DeleteNetworkAclEntry event:
   - Regularly monitor and review AWS CloudTrail logs to identify any unauthorized or suspicious activities related to network ACL modifications.
   - Implement strong access control measures, such as using IAM roles and policies, to restrict access to the AWS account and EC2 instances.
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AWS accounts to add an extra layer of security.

3. AWS CLI command to list and review recent DeleteNetworkAclEntry events:
   ```
   aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=DeleteNetworkAclEntry
   ```

   This command will retrieve the recent events related to DeleteNetworkAclEntry from AWS CloudTrail logs, allowing you to review and investigate any potential security impacts.
