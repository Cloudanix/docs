### Event Information

- The DeleteDhcpOptions event in AWS for EC2 refers to the deletion of a DHCP options set associated with a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
- DHCP options sets in AWS EC2 are used to configure network settings for instances within a VPC, such as DNS servers, domain names, and NTP servers.
- When the DeleteDhcpOptions event occurs, it means that the DHCP options set has been successfully removed from the VPC, and any instances using that DHCP options set will no longer have the associated network configurations.


### Examples

None

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion of DHCP options in AWS for EC2, you can follow these steps:

1. Enable AWS CloudTrail: Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture all API activity within your AWS account. This will help you track and identify any unauthorized actions, such as the deletion of DHCP options.

2. Implement IAM best practices: Ensure that you have implemented proper Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and roles. Follow the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions to users and roles. Regularly review and audit IAM policies to identify any potential vulnerabilities.

3. Enable MFA for privileged accounts: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all privileged accounts, including those with the ability to delete DHCP options. This adds an extra layer of security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

4. Monitor and alert on DHCP option changes: Set up CloudWatch Events or AWS Config rules to monitor and alert on any changes to DHCP options. This will allow you to quickly identify and respond to any unauthorized modifications.

5. Regularly backup DHCP options: Take regular backups of your DHCP options configuration. This can be done by exporting the DHCP options settings using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or AWS Management Console. Storing these backups in a secure location will enable you to restore the configuration if it is accidentally deleted.

6. Implement version control: Use version control systems, such as AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager, to store and manage your DHCP options configuration. This will provide a history of changes and allow you to roll back to a previous version if needed.

7. Regularly review and test your network configuration: Conduct regular reviews of your network configuration, including DHCP options, to ensure they align with your security and compliance requirements. Perform periodic testing to validate the functionality and integrity of your network settings.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of DHCP options in AWS for EC2 and ensure the security and availability of your network infrastructure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unauthorized deletion of DHCP options in AWS EC2, you can take the following steps:

- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AWS console and API access: By enabling MFA, you add an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access to your AWS account. This reduces the risk of unauthorized users being able to delete DHCP options.

- Implement least privilege access control: Ensure that IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies are properly configured to grant only the necessary permissions to users or roles. Restricting access to the DeleteDhcpOptions action to only authorized individuals reduces the likelihood of accidental or malicious deletion.

- Regularly backup DHCP options: Create automated backups of your DHCP options using AWS CLI commands such as `aws ec2 create-dhcp-options` and `aws ec2 associate-dhcp-options`. Storing these backups in a secure location allows for easy restoration in case of accidental deletion or misconfiguration.

Remember to regularly review and update your security measures to stay ahead of potential threats and ensure the integrity of your network settings.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of DHCP options in AWS EC2, you can take the following steps:

1. Implement strong access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have access to the AWS console or API. Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create and manage user accounts, and apply the principle of least privilege by granting only the necessary permissions to each user.

2. Enable CloudTrail logging: Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture all API calls made to your AWS account. This will provide a detailed audit trail of actions taken, including DHCP option deletions. Regularly review the CloudTrail logs for any unauthorized or suspicious activities.

3. Implement backup and recovery mechanisms: Regularly backup your DHCP options configuration using AWS Config or by programmatically exporting the configuration using Python scripts. This will allow you to restore the DHCP options in case of accidental deletion or misconfiguration. Here's an example Python script to export DHCP options:

```python
import boto3

def export_dhcp_options():
    client = boto3.client('ec2')
    response = client.describe_dhcp_options()
    
    dhcp_options = response['DhcpOptions']
    
    with open('dhcp_options.json', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(dhcp_options))
    
    print("DHCP options exported successfully.")

export_dhcp_options()
```

Remember to schedule regular backups and securely store the exported DHCP options configuration to ensure quick recovery in case of any incidents.
