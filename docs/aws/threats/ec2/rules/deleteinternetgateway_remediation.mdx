### Event Information

- The DeleteInternetGateway event in AWS for EC2 refers to the action of removing an internet gateway from a virtual private cloud (VPC) in the AWS environment.
- This event signifies that the internet gateway, which acts as a connection point between the VPC and the internet, has been deleted and is no longer available for routing traffic.
- Deleting an internet gateway effectively cuts off the VPC from the internet, and any resources within the VPC will no longer have outbound internet connectivity unless an alternative internet gateway is attached.


### Examples

- Unauthorized deletion of an internet gateway can lead to a loss of connectivity for EC2 instances, as they will no longer have access to the internet.
- Deleting an internet gateway without proper authorization can result in a potential security breach, as it may allow unauthorized access to the VPC from external networks.
- In a multi-account environment, accidental deletion of an internet gateway can impact the security of other accounts that rely on the connectivity provided by the gateway. This can disrupt inter-account communication and compromise the overall security posture.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Identify the unauthorized deletion: 
   - Monitor AWS CloudTrail logs or any other logging mechanism to identify the event of unauthorized deletion of the internet gateway.
   - Review the logs to determine the user or entity responsible for the deletion.

2. Restore the internet gateway:
   - Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the VPC service.
   - Select the VPC where the internet gateway was deleted.
   - Click on "Actions" and choose "Create Internet Gateway".
   - Attach the newly created internet gateway to the VPC.

3. Verify connectivity and security:
   - Ensure that the EC2 instances within the VPC have regained internet connectivity.
   - Review the VPC's security groups and network ACLs to ensure that they are properly configured to allow the desired inbound and outbound traffic.
   - Consider implementing additional security measures, such as enabling VPC flow logs or configuring network security groups, to prevent future unauthorized deletions.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the unauthorized deletion of an internet gateway in AWS EC2 using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the deleted internet gateway:
   - Use the `describe-internet-gateways` command to list all the internet gateways in the VPC: 
     ```
     aws ec2 describe-internet-gateways --region <region> --profile <profile>
     ```
   - Look for the internet gateway that has been deleted or is no longer associated with the VPC.

2. Restore the internet gateway:
   - Use the `create-internet-gateway` command to create a new internet gateway:
     ```
     aws ec2 create-internet-gateway --region <region> --profile <profile>
     ```
   - Use the `attach-internet-gateway` command to attach the newly created internet gateway to the VPC:
     ```
     aws ec2 attach-internet-gateway --internet-gateway-id <new_gateway_id> --vpc-id <vpc_id> --region <region> --profile <profile>
     ```

3. Verify connectivity and restore routes:
   - Check the route tables associated with the VPC using the `describe-route-tables` command:
     ```
     aws ec2 describe-route-tables --region <region> --profile <profile>
     ```
   - Ensure that the routes for internet access are properly configured, and if necessary, add or update the routes using the `create-route` or `replace-route` command:
     ```
     aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id <route_table_id> --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 --gateway-id <new_gateway_id> --region <region> --profile <profile>
     ```

Note: Replace `<region>` with the appropriate AWS region, `<profile>` with the AWS CLI profile name, `<new_gateway_id>` with the ID of the newly created internet gateway, `<vpc_id>` with the ID of the affected VPC, and `<route_table_id>` with the ID of the affected route table.

#### Using Python

To remediate the unauthorized deletion of an internet gateway in AWS EC2 using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete internet gateways. This can be achieved by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to the necessary resources.

2. Enable AWS CloudTrail: CloudTrail provides detailed logs of API activity in your AWS account, including the deletion of internet gateways. By enabling CloudTrail, you can monitor and track any unauthorized deletion attempts. You can use the Boto3 library in Python to interact with the CloudTrail API and retrieve relevant logs.

3. Implement automated backups: Regularly backing up your internet gateway configurations can help mitigate the impact of accidental deletions. You can use the Boto3 library to create a script that periodically takes snapshots of your internet gateway configurations and stores them in a secure location such as Amazon S3.

Here's an example Python script using Boto3 to check for unauthorized deletion of internet gateways:

```python
import boto3

def check_internet_gateway_deletion():
    ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
    response = ec2_client.describe_internet_gateways()
    
    for internet_gateway in response['InternetGateways']:
        if 'Tags' in internet_gateway:
            for tag in internet_gateway['Tags']:
                if tag['Key'] == 'Authorized' and tag['Value'] == 'False':
                    print(f"Unauthorized deletion detected for internet gateway: {internet_gateway['InternetGatewayId']}")
                    # Perform necessary actions to remediate the issue, such as restoring the internet gateway or notifying the appropriate personnel.

check_internet_gateway_deletion()
```

Please note that this script is a basic example and may need to be customized based on your specific requirements and environment.
