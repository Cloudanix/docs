### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteRouteTable event in AWS EC2 refers to the action of deleting a route table within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in the AWS environment.
- When this event occurs, it indicates that a specific route table has been removed from the VPC, which in turn affects the network traffic routing within the VPC.
- This event can be useful for monitoring and auditing purposes, allowing administrators to track changes made to the network infrastructure and ensure proper management of route tables in the AWS EC2 environment.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteRouteTable event in AWS EC2:
   - If a malicious actor gains unauthorized access to an AWS account or an EC2 instance, they could potentially execute a DeleteRouteTable event to remove a route table associated with critical network resources. This could disrupt network connectivity and compromise the security of the affected resources.

2. Remediation steps for mitigating the impact of DeleteRouteTable event:
   - Implement strong security practices such as using multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AWS accounts and regularly rotating access keys to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Implement strict IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies to control access to EC2 instances and limit the permissions granted to users or roles. Ensure that only trusted individuals have the necessary privileges to modify route tables.
   - Regularly monitor and review CloudTrail logs to detect any unauthorized or suspicious activities related to route table modifications. Enable CloudTrail logs for EC2 and set up alerts or notifications for DeleteRouteTable events.

3. AWS CLI command to restore a deleted route table:
   - If a route table is accidentally deleted, it can be restored using the `create-route-table` command in the AWS CLI. First, identify the VPC ID and subnet associations for the deleted route table. Then, use the following command to create a new route table with the same associations:
   ```
   aws ec2 create-route-table --vpc-id <vpc-id>
   ```
   Once the new route table is created, you can use the `associate-route-table` command to associate it with the desired subnets:
   ```
   aws ec2 associate-route-table --route-table-id <new-route-table-id> --subnet-id <subnet-id>
   ```
