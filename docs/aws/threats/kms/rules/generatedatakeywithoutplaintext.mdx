### Event Information

- The GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext event in AWS Key Management Service (KMS) refers to the action of generating a data key without returning the plaintext version of the key.
- This event is useful when you need to encrypt large amounts of data and want to avoid exposing the plaintext key in memory or logs.
- By generating a data key without the plaintext, you can securely encrypt data using the key and then discard the plaintext key, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized access to encrypted data: If the GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext operation is misused or compromised, it can potentially lead to unauthorized access to encrypted data. This is because the operation allows the generation of a data key without returning the plaintext version of the key. If an attacker gains access to this generated key, they may be able to decrypt the encrypted data.

2. Lack of key management control: GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext bypasses the need for the plaintext version of the data key, which is typically required for key management and control purposes. This can result in a lack of visibility and control over the generated keys, making it difficult to track and manage their usage. It can also make it challenging to rotate or revoke these keys when necessary.

3. Increased risk of data exposure: By generating data keys without the plaintext version, there is an increased risk of data exposure during key handling and storage. Without the plaintext key, it becomes more challenging to securely store and manage the generated keys, potentially leading to accidental exposure or loss of keys. This can ultimately compromise the security of the encrypted data.
