### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext event in AWS KMS refers to the action of generating a data key without returning the plaintext version of the key.
- This event is useful when you need to encrypt data using a symmetric key, but you don't want to expose the plaintext key.
- By generating a data key without the plaintext version, you can securely encrypt data and store or transmit it without the risk of exposing the key.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext event occurs in AWS KMS, it means that a data key was generated without the corresponding plaintext key being provided. This can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities as the plaintext key is required for encrypting and decrypting data.

2. Remediation: To mitigate this security issue, you can follow these steps:

   - Identify the specific AWS KMS key that is generating data keys without plaintext.
   - Review the application or service that is using this key and determine why the plaintext key is not being provided.
   - Update the application or service to ensure that the plaintext key is provided when generating data keys.
   - Monitor the KMS GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext event to identify any recurring issues and take appropriate actions.

   AWS CLI command to monitor the event:
   ```
   aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext
   ```

   Note: The remediation steps may vary depending on the specific use case and application architecture. It is recommended to consult AWS documentation and best practices for further guidance.
