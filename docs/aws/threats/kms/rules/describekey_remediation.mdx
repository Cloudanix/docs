### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DescribeKey event in AWS Real-Time for KMS refers to an event that provides detailed information about a specific key in the Key Management Service (KMS).
- This event can be used to retrieve important metadata about a key, such as its key ID, key ARN, key state, creation date, and key usage.
- By analyzing the DescribeKey event, users can gain insights into the properties and configuration of a KMS key, which can be useful for auditing, monitoring, and managing key resources in AWS.

#### Example

- One possible scenario where the security can be impacted with the DescribeKey event in AWS KMS is if an unauthorized user gains access to the event data. This can happen if the event data is not properly secured or if there are misconfigurations in the event notification settings.

Remediation:
1. Ensure that the event data is encrypted and properly secured. You can enable server-side encryption for the event data stored in S3 by using AWS KMS managed keys or customer-managed keys. Here's an example of how to enable server-side encryption for an S3 bucket using AWS CLI:

```
aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name> --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules": [{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {"SSEAlgorithm": "aws:kms", "KMSMasterKeyID": "<kms-key-id>"}}]}'
```

2. Implement proper access controls and permissions for the event data. Ensure that only authorized users or roles have access to the event data. You can use AWS IAM policies to control access to the event data. Here's an example of how to create an IAM policy that allows only specific IAM roles to access the event data:

```
aws iam create-policy --policy-name <policy-name> --policy-document '{"Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [{"Effect": "Allow", "Action": "kms:DescribeKey", "Resource": "<kms-key-arn>"}]}'
```

3. Regularly monitor and review the event notification settings to ensure that they are properly configured and up to date. Implement automated monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect any unauthorized access or changes to the event notification settings.
