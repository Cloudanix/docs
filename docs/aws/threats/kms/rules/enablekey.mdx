### Event Information

- The EnableKey event in AWS Key Management Service (KMS) refers to the action of enabling a customer master key (CMK) for use.
- When a CMK is enabled, it means that it can be used to encrypt and decrypt data within AWS services and applications.
- Enabling a key is an important step in the key management process, as it allows the CMK to be used for cryptographic operations, such as encrypting data at rest or in transit.


### Examples

- Unauthorized access: Enabling the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key without proper access controls can lead to unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive data. This can result in data breaches and compromise the security of the system.
- Key mismanagement: If the EnableKey operation is not properly managed, it can lead to key misconfiguration or misplacement. This can result in the loss of encryption keys, making it impossible to access encrypted data.
- Lack of auditing and monitoring: Enabling the KMS key without implementing proper auditing and monitoring mechanisms can make it difficult to track and detect any unauthorized or suspicious activities. This can lead to security incidents going unnoticed and unaddressed.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Enable AWS CloudTrail: 
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudTrail service.
   - Click on "Trails" in the left-hand menu and then click on "Create trail".
   - Provide a name for the trail, select the desired S3 bucket to store the logs, and enable log file encryption using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
   - Configure the trail settings according to your requirements and click on "Create trail".

2. Enable AWS Config:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Config service.
   - Click on "Get started" if you haven't enabled AWS Config before.
   - Select the desired AWS resources to be recorded and click on "Next".
   - Choose the S3 bucket to store the configuration history and enable encryption using AWS KMS.
   - Configure the delivery frequency and AWS Config rules as per your requirements and click on "Next".
   - Review the settings and click on "Confirm".

3. Enable AWS GuardDuty:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the GuardDuty service.
   - Click on "Get started" if you haven't enabled GuardDuty before.
   - Choose the AWS region where you want to enable GuardDuty and click on "Enable GuardDuty".
   - Wait for a few minutes for GuardDuty to complete the setup process.
   - Once enabled, GuardDuty will start analyzing the logs and generating findings.

Note: These steps provide a high-level overview of enabling the mentioned services in the AWS console. It is recommended to refer to the official AWS documentation for detailed instructions and best practices.

#### Using CLI

To remediate issues related to AWS Key Management Service (KMS) using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Rotate KMS keys:
   - Identify the KMS key(s) that need to be rotated.
   - Generate a new key using the `create-key` command: `aws kms create-key`.
   - Update the necessary resources to use the new key.
   - Schedule the deletion of the old key using the `schedule-key-deletion` command: `aws kms schedule-key-deletion --key-id <old-key-id> --pending-window-in-days <number-of-days>`.
   - Monitor the key rotation process and ensure that all resources are successfully using the new key.

2. Enable KMS key rotation:
   - Check if key rotation is already enabled for a specific KMS key using the `get-key-rotation-status` command: `aws kms get-key-rotation-status --key-id <key-id>`.
   - If key rotation is not enabled, enable it using the `enable-key-rotation` command: `aws kms enable-key-rotation --key-id <key-id>`.

3. Monitor KMS key usage:
   - Enable CloudTrail logging for KMS API calls to monitor key usage and detect any suspicious activities.
   - Use CloudWatch Logs to create alarms and notifications for specific KMS API events.
   - Regularly review CloudTrail logs and CloudWatch metrics to identify any unauthorized or unusual key usage patterns.

Please note that the actual CLI commands may vary depending on your specific requirements and the AWS CLI version you are using.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issues related to AWS KMS using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Enable AWS CloudTrail for KMS:
   - Use the `boto3` library to create a new CloudTrail trail for KMS.
   - Set the appropriate parameters such as the S3 bucket to store the logs and the KMS key to encrypt the logs.
   - Enable logging for KMS API events by specifying the appropriate event selectors.

```python
import boto3

def enable_cloudtrail_kms():
    client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
    
    response = client.create_trail(
        Name='kms-trail',
        S3BucketName='your-s3-bucket',
        KmsKeyId='your-kms-key-id',
        IsMultiRegionTrail=True
    )
    
    response = client.update_trail(
        Name='kms-trail',
        EventSelectors=[
            {
                'ReadWriteType': 'All',
                'IncludeManagementEvents': True,
                'DataResources': [
                    {
                        'Type': 'AWS::KMS::Key',
                        'Values': ['*']
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    )
```

2. Enable AWS Config for KMS:
   - Use the `boto3` library to create a new AWS Config rule for KMS.
   - Specify the rule parameters such as the required KMS key tags and the desired compliance level.

```python
import boto3

def enable_aws_config_kms():
    client = boto3.client('config')
    
    response = client.put_config_rule(
        ConfigRule={
            'ConfigRuleName': 'kms-key-tags',
            'Description': 'Enforce required tags on KMS keys',
            'Scope': {
                'ComplianceResourceTypes': [
                    'AWS::KMS::Key'
                ]
            },
            'Source': {
                'Owner': 'AWS',
                'SourceIdentifier': 'KMS_KEY_TAGS'
            },
            'InputParameters': '{"requiredTags": ["tag1", "tag2"]}',
            'MaximumExecutionFrequency': 'TwentyFour_Hours'
        }
    )
```

3. Enable AWS Security Hub for KMS:
   - Use the `boto3` library to enable AWS Security Hub for KMS.
   - Specify the appropriate product ARN for KMS.

```python
import boto3

def enable_security_hub_kms():
    client = boto3.client('securityhub')
    
    response = client.batch_enable_standards(
        StandardsSubscriptionRequests=[
            {
                'StandardsArn': 'arn:aws:securityhub:::ruleset/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark/v/1.2.0',
                'ProductArn': 'arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-2:123456789012:product/aws/securityhub'
            }
        ]
    )
```

Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions and credentials set up to execute these scripts successfully.
