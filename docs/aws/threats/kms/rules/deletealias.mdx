### Event Information

- The DeleteAlias event in AWS Key Management Service (KMS) refers to the action of deleting an alias that is associated with a customer master key (CMK).
- When this event occurs, it means that the alias, which provides a human-readable name for the CMK, has been removed from the KMS system.
- This event can be useful for auditing and tracking purposes, as it indicates that the alias is no longer available and any references to it should be updated or removed.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of a KMS alias: If security is impacted with the DeleteAlias operation in AWS Key Management Service (KMS), it could potentially allow an unauthorized user to delete a KMS alias. This could lead to the loss of access to encrypted data or the compromise of sensitive information.

2. Accidental deletion of a critical alias: The DeleteAlias operation in AWS KMS can also pose a security risk if a critical alias is accidentally deleted. This could result in the loss of access to encrypted resources, disruption of services, or the need for time-consuming recovery processes.

3. Impact on encryption key management: Deleting a KMS alias without proper authorization or understanding of the implications can disrupt encryption key management practices. This can lead to difficulties in managing and tracking encryption keys, potentially compromising the security and integrity of encrypted data.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized deletion of a KMS alias:
- Step 1: Identify the unauthorized deletion by monitoring KMS API logs or CloudTrail logs.
- Step 2: Determine the impact of the deletion by assessing the encrypted data and encryption keys associated with the deleted alias.
- Step 3: Restore the deleted alias by recreating it with the same name and pointing it to the correct KMS key.
- Step 4: Review and update the IAM policies and permissions to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete KMS aliases.

2. Accidental deletion of a critical alias:
- Step 1: Identify the accidental deletion by monitoring KMS API logs or CloudTrail logs.
- Step 2: Assess the impact of the deletion by identifying the applications or services that rely on the deleted alias.
- Step 3: Restore the deleted alias by recreating it with the same name and pointing it to the correct KMS key.
- Step 4: Implement preventive measures such as enabling MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for critical operations like deleting aliases to reduce the risk of accidental deletions.

3. Malicious deletion of an alias to bypass encryption controls:
- Step 1: Identify the malicious deletion by monitoring KMS API logs or CloudTrail logs and look for any suspicious activities or patterns.
- Step 2: Assess the impact of the deletion by identifying the encrypted data and encryption keys associated with the deleted alias.
- Step 3: Restore the deleted alias by recreating it with the same name and pointing it to the correct KMS key.
- Step 4: Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the root cause of the attack and take appropriate actions such as revoking access for compromised accounts, updating IAM policies, and implementing additional security controls like AWS CloudHSM for enhanced key protection.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion of a KMS alias:
- Identify the unauthorized deletion by monitoring CloudTrail logs or KMS API activity.
- Restore the deleted alias using the `create-alias` AWS CLI command, specifying the original alias name and the target key ID.

2. Accidental deletion of a critical alias:
- Regularly backup KMS aliases to prevent accidental deletion.
- Restore the deleted alias using the `create-alias` AWS CLI command, specifying the original alias name and the target key ID.

3. Malicious deletion of an alias to bypass encryption controls:
- Implement strict IAM policies to control access to KMS aliases and prevent unauthorized deletion.
- Monitor CloudTrail logs for any suspicious activity related to KMS aliases and take appropriate actions based on the findings.

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized deletion of a KMS alias:
- Monitor KMS API calls: Implement CloudTrail to capture and log all API calls related to KMS, including DeleteAlias. Regularly review the CloudTrail logs to identify any unauthorized or suspicious deletion attempts.
- Enable AWS Config: Enable AWS Config to track changes to KMS aliases. Create a custom Config rule to detect and alert on any unauthorized deletion of aliases. Take appropriate actions, such as disabling the IAM user or role responsible for the deletion.

2. Accidental deletion of a critical alias:
- Implement alias backup: Regularly backup KMS aliases using AWS SDKs or CLI. Store the backups in a secure location, such as S3 or another encrypted storage service. In case of accidental deletion, the alias can be restored from the backup.
- Enable versioning for aliases: Enable versioning for KMS aliases to retain previous versions. This allows you to revert to a previous version in case of accidental deletion. Use the AWS SDKs or CLI to manage alias versions.

3. Malicious deletion of an alias to bypass encryption controls:
- Implement least privilege access: Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to IAM users or roles. Restrict the DeleteAlias operation to only authorized users or roles. Regularly review and update IAM policies to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.
- Enable MFA for critical operations: Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users or roles performing critical operations, including DeleteAlias. This adds an extra layer of security and reduces the risk of unauthorized deletion by an attacker.
