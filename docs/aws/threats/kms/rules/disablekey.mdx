### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DisableKey event in AWS Real-time for KMS refers to the action of disabling a customer master key (CMK) in AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
- When a DisableKey event occurs, it means that the CMK is no longer available for use in cryptographic operations, such as encrypting or decrypting data.
- Disabling a key is a security measure that can be taken to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data, especially in situations where the key may have been compromised or is no longer needed.

Note: It is important to carefully consider the implications of disabling a key, as it may impact any resources or applications that rely on the key for encryption or decryption operations.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the DisableKey event is triggered in AWS KMS (Key Management Service), it could potentially lead to unauthorized access to encrypted data. This event indicates that a key has been disabled, which means that any attempts to use the key for encryption or decryption will fail. If an attacker gains access to the disabled key, they will not only be unable to perform any cryptographic operations, but they may also be able to identify the resources that were protected by the key, potentially exposing sensitive data.

Remediation:
- Immediately investigate the DisableKey event to determine the cause and scope of the issue.
- Enable the key again if it was disabled accidentally or due to a misconfiguration.
- If the key was disabled intentionally, review the access policies and permissions associated with the key to ensure that only authorized users have the ability to disable it.
- Monitor the key usage and access logs to detect any suspicious activities.
- Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for key management operations to add an extra layer of security.

AWS CLI command to enable a disabled key:
```
aws kms enable-key --key-id <key-id>
```

2. Example of security impact: If the DisableKey event is triggered for a KMS key that is used to encrypt data at rest in an AWS service (e.g., Amazon S3, Amazon EBS), it could result in the loss of data confidentiality. When a key is disabled, any attempts to decrypt the encrypted data using that key will fail, rendering the data inaccessible. This can have serious implications if the disabled key is used to protect sensitive or regulated data.

Remediation:
- Investigate the DisableKey event to identify the cause and take appropriate actions.
- If the key was disabled accidentally or due to a misconfiguration, enable it again.
- If the key was disabled intentionally, review the access policies and permissions associated with the key to ensure that only authorized users have the ability to disable it.
- Restore data access by re-encrypting the affected data with an active key.
- Implement regular backups of encrypted data to mitigate the impact of key disablement events.
- Consider implementing a key rotation policy to minimize the impact of a disabled key.

AWS CLI command to re-encrypt data using an active key:
```
aws s3 cp s3://<bucket-name>/<encrypted-object> s3://<bucket-name>/<new-encrypted-object> --sse-c <active-key-id>
```

3. Example of security impact: If the DisableKey event is triggered for a KMS key that is used to encrypt sensitive configuration parameters or secrets in an application, it could lead to unauthorized access to these secrets. Disabling the key would render the encrypted secrets unusable, potentially causing application failures or exposing sensitive information if the secrets are stored in a compromised location.

Remediation:
- Investigate the DisableKey event to determine the cause and scope of the issue.
- If the key was disabled accidentally or due to a misconfiguration, enable it again.
- If the key was disabled intentionally, review the access policies and permissions associated with the key to ensure that only authorized users have the ability to disable it.
- Update the application's configuration to use an active key for encryption and decryption operations.
- Rotate the affected secrets and update the application with the new encrypted values.
- Implement secure storage mechanisms for secrets, such as using a secrets manager or encrypted key-value store.
- Regularly audit and monitor the usage of keys and secrets to detect any unauthorized access attempts.

AWS CLI command to update an application's configuration with a new encrypted secret:
```
aws ssm put-parameter --name <parameter-name> --value <new-encrypted-value> --type SecureString --key-id <active-key-id>
```
