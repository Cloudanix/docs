### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteAlias event in AWS Key Management Service (KMS) refers to the action of deleting an alias that is associated with a customer master key (CMK).
- When this event occurs, it means that the alias, which provides a human-readable name for the CMK, has been removed from the KMS system.
- This event can be useful for auditing and tracking purposes, as it indicates that the alias is no longer available and any references to it should be updated or removed.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteAlias in AWS Key Management Service (KMS), an attacker with sufficient permissions could delete an alias that is used to reference a specific KMS key. This could lead to unauthorized access to encrypted data or disruption of critical services relying on that key.

- Remediation steps using AWS console:
  1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS KMS console.
  2. In the navigation pane, choose "Aliases".
  3. Locate the alias that you want to protect from accidental deletion or unauthorized deletion.
  4. Choose the alias and click on the "Key actions" dropdown menu.
  5. Select "Edit alias".
  6. In the "Alias name" field, append a suffix or prefix to the existing alias name to make it unique and less predictable.
  7. Click on "Save changes" to update the alias.
  8. To further enhance security, you can also restrict the IAM policies associated with the KMS key to prevent unauthorized deletion or modification of aliases.
  9. Review and update the IAM policies associated with the KMS key to ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to manage aliases.
  10. Regularly monitor CloudTrail logs and enable CloudTrail log file validation to detect any unauthorized attempts to delete or modify aliases.

Note: It is important to follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to IAM users or roles to mitigate the risk of unauthorized actions.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteAlias in AWS Key Management Service (KMS), an attacker with sufficient permissions could delete an alias that is used to reference a specific key. This could lead to unauthorized access to encrypted data or disruption of critical services relying on that key.

- Remediation steps using AWS CLI:
  1. Restrict IAM permissions: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete aliases in KMS. Review and modify the IAM policies associated with the relevant users or roles to limit their access to the `kms:DeleteAlias` action.
  
  2. Enable CloudTrail logging: Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity related to KMS, including the `DeleteAlias` action. This will provide an audit trail of any alias deletions and help in identifying any unauthorized or suspicious activities.
  
  3. Monitor CloudTrail logs: Regularly review the CloudTrail logs for any unexpected or unauthorized `DeleteAlias` actions. Set up alerts or use AWS services like Amazon CloudWatch Events to trigger notifications or automated actions when such events occur.

#### Using Python

- Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and deletes a KMS alias, it can lead to a loss of access to the underlying key. This can result in data loss or unauthorized access to encrypted data.

- Remediation steps using Python:
  1. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have permissions to delete KMS aliases. Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to the necessary individuals or roles.
  
  ```python
  import boto3

  def restrict_delete_alias():
      kms_client = boto3.client('kms')
      alias_name = 'alias/your-alias-name'
      policy = {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Sid": "RestrictDeleteAlias",
                  "Effect": "Deny",
                  "Action": "kms:DeleteAlias",
                  "Resource": f"arn:aws:kms:region:account-id:alias/{alias_name}"
              }
          ]
      }
      policy_string = json.dumps(policy)
      kms_client.put_key_policy(
          KeyId='your-key-id',
          PolicyName='RestrictDeleteAliasPolicy',
          Policy=policy_string
      )
  ```
  
  2. Enable AWS CloudTrail: CloudTrail provides detailed logs of API activity in your AWS account. By enabling CloudTrail, you can monitor and audit any delete alias events and take appropriate actions.
  
  ```python
  import boto3

  def enable_cloudtrail():
      cloudtrail_client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
      trail_name = 'your-trail-name'
      kms_arn = 'arn:aws:kms:region:account-id:key/your-key-id'
      cloudtrail_client.create_trail(
          Name=trail_name,
          S3BucketName='your-s3-bucket-name',
          IsMultiRegionTrail=True,
          IncludeGlobalServiceEvents=True,
          EnableLogFileValidation=True,
          CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn='arn:aws:logs:region:account-id:log-group:your-log-group',
          CloudWatchLogsRoleArn='arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/your-cloudwatch-logs-role',
          KmsKeyId=kms_arn
      )
  ```
  
  3. Regularly monitor CloudTrail logs: Continuously monitor the CloudTrail logs for any delete alias events. Set up alerts or notifications to be notified in real-time if any unauthorized delete alias events occur.
