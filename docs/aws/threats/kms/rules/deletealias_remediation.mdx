### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteAlias event in AWS KMS refers to the action of deleting an alias for a customer master key (CMK) in the Key Management Service.
- When this event occurs, it means that the alias, which is a friendly name associated with a CMK, has been removed from the KMS.
- This event can be useful for tracking changes and auditing purposes, as it indicates that the alias is no longer available for use in referencing the CMK.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteAlias event in AWS KMS:
   - An unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and deletes a KMS alias that is used to encrypt sensitive data.
   - This can lead to a loss of data confidentiality and integrity, as the encrypted data can no longer be decrypted without the alias.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteAlias event in AWS KMS:
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture all API calls related to KMS, including DeleteAlias. This will help in identifying unauthorized access and actions.
   - Implement strong access controls and least privilege principles to restrict access to KMS resources. Regularly review and update IAM policies to ensure only authorized users have the necessary permissions.
   - Regularly backup KMS aliases and cryptographic materials to a secure location, such as AWS Key Management Service (KMS) Custom Key Store or AWS Secrets Manager. This will help in recovering from accidental or malicious deletion of aliases.

3. AWS CLI command to delete a KMS alias:
   ```
   aws kms delete-alias --alias-name <alias-name>
   ```
   - Replace `<alias-name>` with the actual alias name you want to delete.
   - Ensure that the user executing this command has the necessary permissions to delete the alias.
