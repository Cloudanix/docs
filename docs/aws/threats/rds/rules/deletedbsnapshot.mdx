### Event Information

- The DeleteDBSnapshot event in AWS for RDS refers to the action of deleting a manual database snapshot in Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service).
- When this event occurs, it means that a user or an automated process has initiated the deletion of a specific database snapshot.
- Deleting a DB snapshot permanently removes the snapshot and its associated data, freeing up storage space and reducing costs.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If proper access controls and permissions are not in place, an attacker with sufficient privileges could potentially delete a DB snapshot, leading to data loss and potential security breaches.

2. Data exposure: If a DB snapshot contains sensitive or confidential information, its deletion could result in unauthorized access to that data. This could occur if the snapshot is accidentally deleted or if an attacker gains access to the necessary credentials to delete it.

3. Compliance violations: Depending on the industry and regulatory requirements, organizations may be required to retain DB snapshots for a certain period of time. If a snapshot is deleted prematurely, it could result in non-compliance and potential legal consequences. It is important to have proper retention policies and controls in place to prevent accidental or unauthorized deletions.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate the risk of unauthorized deletion in AWS RDS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

- Implement strong access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary credentials and privileges to perform the DeleteDBSnapshot operation. Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage user permissions and enforce the principle of least privilege.

- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA): Require the use of MFA for privileged actions, such as deleting database snapshots. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring an additional authentication factor, such as a physical token or a virtual MFA device.

- Enable AWS CloudTrail: CloudTrail provides detailed logs of API activity in your AWS account, including the DeleteDBSnapshot operation. By enabling CloudTrail, you can monitor and audit snapshot deletion events, helping to detect and investigate any unauthorized deletions.

2. Data exposure: To remediate the risk of data exposure during snapshot deletion in AWS RDS, consider the following steps:

- Implement encryption at rest: Enable encryption for your RDS snapshots using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). This ensures that even if a snapshot is deleted, the sensitive data remains protected.

- Implement secure access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or applications have access to the snapshots. Use IAM policies to control who can view and delete snapshots, and regularly review and update these policies to align with your security requirements.

- Regularly review and delete unnecessary snapshots: Regularly review your snapshots and delete any that are no longer needed. This reduces the potential exposure of sensitive data and minimizes the attack surface.

3. Compliance violations: To avoid compliance violations when using DeleteDBSnapshot in AWS RDS, consider the following steps:

- Understand regulatory requirements: Familiarize yourself with the specific compliance standards and regulations that apply to your organization. Identify any requirements related to snapshot retention and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the retention periods.

- Implement snapshot lifecycle policies: Use AWS Backup or custom scripts to automate the management of your snapshots. Implement policies that align with your compliance requirements, ensuring that snapshots are retained for the required duration and deleted only when appropriate.

- Regularly audit and monitor snapshot activities: Use AWS CloudTrail and other monitoring tools to track snapshot deletion events and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Regularly review audit logs and conduct internal audits to identify any potential compliance violations and take appropriate actions.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate the risk of unauthorized deletion in AWS RDS, you can implement the following steps using AWS CLI commands:

- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the AWS account and enforce its usage for critical operations like deleting snapshots. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring an additional authentication factor.
```
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <db-instance-identifier> --enable-mfa
```

- Implement strict access controls by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete snapshots.
```
aws iam create-policy --policy-name <policy-name> --policy-document file://policy.json
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <user-name> --policy-arn <policy-arn>
```

2. Data exposure: To mitigate the risk of data exposure during snapshot deletion, you can take the following actions:

- Encrypt your RDS snapshots using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). This ensures that even if a snapshot is deleted, the sensitive data remains protected.
```
aws rds modify-db-snapshot --db-snapshot-identifier <db-snapshot-identifier> --storage-encrypted
```

- Implement secure access controls to restrict access to snapshots. Use IAM policies to grant access only to authorized users or roles.
```
aws rds modify-db-snapshot-attribute --db-snapshot-identifier <db-snapshot-identifier> --attribute-name restore --values-to-add <aws-account-id>:<iam-role-arn>
```

3. Compliance violations: To avoid compliance violations related to snapshot deletion, follow these steps:

- Implement a snapshot retention policy that aligns with your compliance requirements. This ensures that snapshots are retained for the required duration.
```
aws rds modify-db-snapshot-attribute --db-snapshot-identifier <db-snapshot-identifier> --attribute-name retention --values-to-add <number-of-days>
```

- Regularly monitor and audit snapshot deletion activities using AWS CloudTrail. This helps in identifying any unauthorized or non-compliant deletions.
```
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <trail-name> --s3-bucket-name <bucket-name> --is-multi-region-trail
aws cloudtrail start-logging --name <trail-name>
```

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion, data exposure, and compliance violations in AWS RDS using Python scripts, you can:

1. Implement IAM Policies: Create and enforce strict IAM policies to control access to the DeleteDBSnapshot operation. Only authorized users or roles should have the necessary permissions to delete snapshots. Regularly review and update these policies to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.

```python
import boto3

def create_iam_policy():
    policy_document = {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "rds:DeleteDBSnapshot",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:rds:<region>:<account-id>:snapshot:<snapshot-id>"
            }
        ]
    }
    
    iam = boto3.client('iam')
    response = iam.create_policy(
        PolicyName='RDSDeleteSnapshotPolicy',
        PolicyDocument=json.dumps(policy_document)
    )
    
    return response['Policy']['Arn']
```

2. Enable Encryption: Ensure that all database snapshots are encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). This helps protect sensitive data from exposure in case of unauthorized deletion. You can enable encryption for RDS snapshots by modifying the DB instance settings or using the AWS Management Console.

```python
import boto3

def enable_snapshot_encryption(db_instance_identifier):
    rds = boto3.client('rds')
    response = rds.modify_db_instance(
        DBInstanceIdentifier=db_instance_identifier,
        StorageEncrypted=True
    )
    
    return response['DBInstance']['DBInstanceIdentifier']
```

3. Implement Compliance Controls: To avoid compliance violations, establish and enforce retention policies for database snapshots. This ensures that snapshots are retained for the required duration as per regulatory or industry standards. You can use AWS CloudWatch Events and AWS Lambda to automate the enforcement of retention policies.

```python
import boto3

def enforce_compliance_policies():
    cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
    lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')
    
    response = cloudwatch.put_rule(
        Name='SnapshotRetentionRule',
        ScheduleExpression='cron(0 0 * * ? *)',  # Run daily at midnight
        State='ENABLED'
    )
    
    rule_arn = response['RuleArn']
    
    response = lambda_client.create_function(
        FunctionName='SnapshotRetentionFunction',
        Runtime='python3.8',
        Role='arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<lambda-role>',
        Handler='lambda_function.lambda_handler',
        Code={
            'ZipFile': 'def lambda_handler(event, context):\n    # Implement snapshot retention logic here'
        }
    )
    
    lambda_arn = response['FunctionArn']
    
    response = cloudwatch.put_targets(
        Rule='SnapshotRetentionRule',
        Targets=[
            {
                'Id': '1',
                'Arn': lambda_arn
            }
        ]
    )
    
    return rule_arn, lambda_arn
```
