### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteDBSnapshot event in AWS RDS refers to the action of deleting a manual database snapshot.
- This event occurs when a user or an automated process initiates the deletion of a specific database snapshot in RDS.
- Deleting a DB snapshot permanently removes the snapshot and its associated data, freeing up storage space in the RDS instance.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteDBSnapshot event in AWS RDS:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account or the RDS service, they may attempt to delete a DB snapshot. This can result in the loss of critical data and impact the security and availability of the database.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteDBSnapshot event in AWS RDS:
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the AWS account to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access.
   - Implement strict access control policies by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete DB snapshots.
   - Regularly monitor and review AWS CloudTrail logs to detect any unauthorized or suspicious activities related to the DeleteDBSnapshot event.

3. Bash script example to enable MFA for an AWS account:
   ```
   # Install AWS CLI if not already installed
   pip install awscli --upgrade --user
   
   # Enable MFA for the AWS account
   aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <user-name> --serial-number <mfa-serial-number> --authentication-code1 <code1> --authentication-code2 <code2>
   ```

Note: Replace `<user-name>` with the actual IAM user name, `<mfa-serial-number>` with the MFA device serial number, `<code1>` and `<code2>` with the authentication codes provided by the MFA device.

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform these actions and customize the script as per your specific requirements.
