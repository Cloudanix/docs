### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The CreateDBClusterSnapshot event in AWS for RDS refers to the action of creating a snapshot of a database cluster in Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service).
- A DB cluster snapshot is a backup of the entire database cluster, including all its associated databases and their data. It captures the state of the cluster at a specific point in time.
- This event is useful for creating backups, restoring databases, and cloning database clusters. It allows you to easily restore your database cluster to a previous state or create a new cluster from the snapshot.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example of security impact: If the CreateDBClusterSnapshot operation is not properly secured, it can potentially expose sensitive data stored in the RDS database cluster snapshot to unauthorized users. This can lead to data breaches and compromise the confidentiality of the data.

- Remediation steps using AWS console:
  1. Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon RDS service.
  2. Select the appropriate region where the RDS database cluster is located.
  3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Snapshots" and then select "DB cluster snapshots".
  4. Identify the snapshot that needs to be secured and click on its name to open the snapshot details page.
  5. In the "Permissions" section, click on "Modify" to update the snapshot's permissions.
  6. Review the existing permissions and remove any unnecessary or unauthorized accounts or roles.
  7. Add the appropriate AWS accounts or IAM roles that should have access to the snapshot.
  8. Ensure that the permissions are set to the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary access.
  9. Click on "Save" to apply the updated permissions to the snapshot.
  10. Regularly review and audit the snapshot permissions to ensure ongoing security.

Note: It is important to follow AWS security best practices, such as enabling encryption at rest and in transit, using strong access control policies, and regularly monitoring and reviewing permissions, to further enhance the security of RDS database cluster snapshots.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with CreateDBClusterSnapshot in AWS for RDS, it could be due to the snapshot being created with public access permissions, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Remediation: To remediate this issue for AWS RDS using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:
  1. Identify the affected RDS cluster and snapshot.
  2. Revoke public access permissions for the snapshot by modifying its permissions.
  3. Use the AWS CLI command `modify-db-cluster-snapshot-attribute` to update the snapshot attribute and remove public access permissions. The command syntax would be:
     ```
     aws rds modify-db-cluster-snapshot-attribute --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <snapshot-identifier> --attribute-name restore --values-to-add all --values-to-remove public
     ```
     Replace `<snapshot-identifier>` with the actual identifier of the affected snapshot.
     
     This command will modify the snapshot attribute to remove public access permissions and allow only authorized users to access the snapshot.
