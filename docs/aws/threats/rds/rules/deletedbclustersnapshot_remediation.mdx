### Event Information

- The DeleteDBClusterSnapshot event in AWS for RDS refers to the action of deleting a manual snapshot of an Amazon RDS Aurora cluster.
- This event occurs when a user or an automated process initiates the deletion of a specific snapshot using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or API.
- Deleting a DB cluster snapshot permanently removes the snapshot and its associated data, and it cannot be undone. It is important to ensure that the snapshot is no longer needed before initiating the deletion.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If proper access controls and permissions are not in place, an attacker with sufficient privileges could potentially delete a DB cluster snapshot, leading to data loss and potential security breaches.

2. Data exposure: If a DB cluster snapshot contains sensitive or confidential data, its deletion could result in unauthorized access to that data. This could occur if the snapshot is not properly encrypted or if it is accidentally shared with unauthorized users.

3. Compliance violations: Deleting a DB cluster snapshot without proper documentation and retention policies can lead to compliance violations. Many regulatory frameworks require organizations to retain data backups for a specific period of time, and deleting snapshots prematurely can result in non-compliance.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of a DB cluster snapshot in AWS RDS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Review and update access controls and permissions: Ensure that proper access controls and permissions are in place for the AWS RDS service. This includes reviewing and updating IAM policies, security groups, and database user permissions to restrict access to authorized individuals or roles only.

- Step 2: Enable snapshot deletion protection: Enable snapshot deletion protection for your DB cluster snapshots. This feature prevents accidental or unauthorized deletion of snapshots by requiring additional confirmation before deletion. You can enable this protection by navigating to the AWS RDS console, selecting your DB cluster, and enabling the "Deletion protection" option for the snapshots.

- Step 3: Regularly monitor and audit snapshot activities: Implement a monitoring and auditing mechanism to track snapshot activities. This can be achieved by enabling AWS CloudTrail to capture API calls related to snapshot management. Regularly review the CloudTrail logs to identify any suspicious or unauthorized snapshot deletion attempts.

2. Data exposure: To remediate data exposure due to the deletion of a DB cluster snapshot in AWS RDS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Implement data classification and encryption: Classify your sensitive or confidential data and ensure that appropriate encryption mechanisms are in place. AWS RDS provides options for encrypting data at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Enable encryption for your DB cluster snapshots to protect the data from unauthorized access.

- Step 2: Implement backup and retention policies: Establish backup and retention policies that define the frequency and duration of DB cluster snapshot backups. Ensure that these policies align with your organization's data protection requirements and compliance standards. Regularly create and retain backups of your DB cluster snapshots to minimize the impact of accidental or intentional deletion.

- Step 3: Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA for AWS RDS console access to add an extra layer of security. This helps prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to the console and potentially deleting DB cluster snapshots. Configure MFA for IAM users or roles that have permissions to manage RDS resources.

3. Compliance violations: To remediate compliance violations related to the deletion of DB cluster snapshots in AWS RDS using the AWS console, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Understand regulatory requirements: Familiarize yourself with the specific regulatory requirements applicable to your organization, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS. Identify the data retention and backup requirements mandated by these regulations.

- Step 2: Implement snapshot lifecycle management: Configure snapshot lifecycle management policies to automate the creation, retention, and deletion of DB cluster snapshots based on your compliance requirements. This ensures that snapshots are retained for the required duration and deleted only when no longer needed.

- Step 3: Maintain proper documentation: Keep detailed documentation of your snapshot management processes, including the justification for snapshot deletions. This documentation will help demonstrate compliance during audits and ensure that snapshots are deleted in accordance with your organization's policies and regulatory obligations.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of a DB cluster snapshot in AWS RDS, follow these steps using AWS CLI:

- Implement proper access controls and permissions: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary privileges to delete DB cluster snapshots. Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage user permissions and restrict access to snapshot deletion.

- Enable snapshot deletion protection: Enable snapshot deletion protection for your DB cluster snapshots. This feature prevents accidental or unauthorized deletion by requiring an additional confirmation step before deleting a snapshot. You can enable snapshot deletion protection using the `modify-db-cluster-snapshot-attribute` command in AWS CLI.

2. Data exposure: To remediate data exposure due to the deletion of a DB cluster snapshot in AWS RDS, consider the following steps:

- Regularly backup and encrypt sensitive data: Implement a regular backup strategy for your DB cluster snapshots to minimize the impact of accidental or intentional deletion. Additionally, enable encryption for your snapshots to protect the data at rest.

- Implement data access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have access to the DB cluster snapshots. Use IAM policies to control who can view and manage the snapshots.

3. Compliance violations: To remediate compliance violations related to the deletion of DB cluster snapshots in AWS RDS, consider the following actions:

- Document and justify snapshot deletion: Maintain proper documentation and justification for deleting DB cluster snapshots. This includes recording the reason for deletion, the date and time of deletion, and any relevant compliance requirements.

- Implement snapshot lifecycle policies: Use AWS Backup or custom scripts to automate the management of DB cluster snapshots. Implement snapshot lifecycle policies to ensure that snapshots are retained for the required compliance period before being deleted.

- Regularly audit snapshot deletion activities: Monitor and audit snapshot deletion activities to ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks. Use AWS CloudTrail to capture API calls related to snapshot deletion and regularly review the logs for any unauthorized or non-compliant actions.

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of DB cluster snapshots in AWS RDS, you can implement the following steps using Python:

- Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage user access and permissions. Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary privileges to delete DB cluster snapshots.
- Implement AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API calls related to DB cluster snapshots. This will help in identifying any unauthorized deletion attempts and provide an audit trail for investigation.
- Create a Python script that periodically checks the status of DB cluster snapshots and sends notifications or alerts in case of any unexpected deletions. This can be achieved using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with the RDS API.

2. Data exposure: To mitigate the risk of data exposure due to accidental or intentional deletion of DB cluster snapshots in AWS RDS, you can take the following steps using Python:

- Implement a backup retention policy that ensures snapshots containing sensitive or confidential data are retained for a specific period of time. This can be achieved by setting up a lifecycle policy using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).
- Regularly validate the existence and integrity of DB cluster snapshots containing sensitive data. You can create a Python script that checks the metadata of snapshots and compares it against a predefined list of sensitive data identifiers.
- Implement versioning for DB cluster snapshots to prevent accidental deletion. This can be done using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to enable versioning on the RDS cluster.

3. Compliance violations: To avoid compliance violations related to premature deletion of DB cluster snapshots in AWS RDS, you can follow these steps using Python:

- Implement a retention policy that aligns with the requirements of the applicable regulatory frameworks. This can be achieved by creating a Python script that checks the age of DB cluster snapshots and alerts or prevents deletion if they are not yet due for deletion.
- Use AWS CloudTrail to capture and log all API calls related to DB cluster snapshots, including deletions. This will provide an audit trail for compliance purposes.
- Regularly review and document the justification for deleting DB cluster snapshots. You can create a Python script that generates reports or notifications highlighting any deletions made without proper documentation.
