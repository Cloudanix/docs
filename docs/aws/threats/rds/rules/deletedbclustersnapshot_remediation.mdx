### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteDBClusterSnapshot event in AWS RDS refers to the deletion of a snapshot of a database cluster. 
- This event occurs when a user or an automated process initiates the deletion of a database cluster snapshot in AWS RDS. 
- The DeleteDBClusterSnapshot event is logged in the awsrealtime event stream to provide real-time visibility and auditing of snapshot deletion activities in the RDS environment.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and triggers a DeleteDBClusterSnapshot event in AWS RDS, it can lead to the following security implications:
   - Data loss: The deletion of a database cluster snapshot can result in the loss of critical data, impacting business operations and potentially violating data retention policies.
   - Unauthorized access: An attacker may attempt to delete a database cluster snapshot to cover their tracks after gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.

2. Remediation steps:
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the AWS account to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access.
   - Implement strict access control policies by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete database cluster snapshots.
   - Regularly monitor and review AWS CloudTrail logs to detect any suspicious activities, including unauthorized deletion of database cluster snapshots.

3. AWS CLI command for listing and deleting RDS cluster snapshots:
   - To list all available RDS cluster snapshots: `aws rds describe-db-cluster-snapshots`
   - To delete a specific RDS cluster snapshot: `aws rds delete-db-cluster-snapshot --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <snapshot-identifier>`
