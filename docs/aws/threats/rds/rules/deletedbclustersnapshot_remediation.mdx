### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteDBClusterSnapshot event in AWS for RDS refers to the action of deleting a manual snapshot of an Amazon RDS Aurora cluster or a shared snapshot of an Amazon RDS Aurora global database cluster.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process initiates the deletion of a specific DB cluster snapshot using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.
- It is important to note that deleting a DB cluster snapshot is irreversible, and once deleted, the snapshot cannot be recovered. Therefore, it is crucial to exercise caution and ensure that the snapshot being deleted is no longer needed before initiating this action.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Example of security impact with DeleteDBClusterSnapshot in AWS for RDS:
- If the DeleteDBClusterSnapshot operation is misused or unauthorized, it can lead to the deletion of important database snapshots, resulting in data loss and potential security breaches.
- An attacker with access to the necessary permissions can delete snapshots containing sensitive data, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the data stored in the RDS cluster.

Remediation steps for AWS RDS using AWS console:
1. Restrict IAM permissions: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to perform the DeleteDBClusterSnapshot operation. Review and modify the IAM policies to limit access to trusted individuals or roles.
2. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enable MFA for the AWS accounts or IAM users with permissions to delete RDS snapshots. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring an additional authentication factor, such as a physical token or a virtual MFA app.
3. Enable AWS CloudTrail: Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity logs for RDS. This will provide a detailed audit trail of all API calls, including DeleteDBClusterSnapshot, allowing you to monitor and investigate any unauthorized or suspicious activities. Regularly review the CloudTrail logs for any unusual or unauthorized activities related to snapshot deletion.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteDBClusterSnapshot in AWS for RDS, an example could be an unauthorized user gaining access to the AWS CLI or API credentials and using the DeleteDBClusterSnapshot command to delete a critical database cluster snapshot.

To remediate this for AWS RDS using AWS CLI, the following steps can be taken:

1. Rotate Access Keys: Rotate the AWS access keys regularly to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. This can be done using the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console or CLI commands.

```
aws iam create-access-key --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME>
aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id <ACCESS_KEY_ID>
```

2. Implement Least Privilege: Ensure that IAM users or roles have the minimum required permissions to perform their tasks. Grant only the necessary permissions to delete RDS cluster snapshots.

```
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME> --policy-arn <POLICY_ARN>
```

3. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enable MFA for IAM users to add an extra layer of security. This will require users to provide a valid MFA code along with their credentials when using the AWS CLI.

```
aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME> --serial-number <MFA_SERIAL_NUMBER> --authentication-code1 <CODE1> --authentication-code2 <CODE2>
```

By following these steps, the risk of unauthorized access and misuse of the DeleteDBClusterSnapshot command can be mitigated.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact: If the `DeleteDBClusterSnapshot` action is not properly secured, an unauthorized user or a malicious actor could potentially delete important database cluster snapshots. This could lead to data loss, service disruption, or even compromise of sensitive information.

2. Remediation steps using Python:
   - Implement proper access control and authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users or applications can perform the `DeleteDBClusterSnapshot` action.
   - Utilize AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to the `DeleteDBClusterSnapshot` action based on the principle of least privilege. Grant this permission only to the necessary roles or users.
   - Regularly monitor and review the AWS CloudTrail logs to detect any unauthorized or suspicious activities related to the `DeleteDBClusterSnapshot` action.

Python script example to restrict access to `DeleteDBClusterSnapshot` using IAM policy:

```python
import boto3

def create_iam_policy():
    policy_document = {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Deny",
                "Action": "rds:DeleteDBClusterSnapshot",
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }

    iam = boto3.client('iam')
    response = iam.create_policy(
        PolicyName='RestrictDeleteDBClusterSnapshot',
        PolicyDocument=json.dumps(policy_document)
    )

    return response['Policy']['Arn']

def attach_policy_to_user(user_name, policy_arn):
    iam = boto3.client('iam')
    response = iam.attach_user_policy(
        UserName=user_name,
        PolicyArn=policy_arn
    )

    return response

# Example usage
policy_arn = create_iam_policy()
attach_policy_to_user('example_user', policy_arn)
```

Note: This script creates an IAM policy that denies the `DeleteDBClusterSnapshot` action and attaches it to a specified IAM user. Adjust the script as per your specific requirements and user management setup.
