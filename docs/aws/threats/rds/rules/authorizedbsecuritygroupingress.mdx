### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "AuthorizeDBSecurityGroupIngress" event in AWS RDS refers to the action of granting inbound access to a security group associated with an RDS database instance.
- This event occurs when a rule is added to the security group's inbound rules to allow incoming traffic from a specific source IP address or range, or from another security group.
- It is an important event to monitor as it indicates changes in the network access permissions for the RDS instance, which can impact the security and accessibility of the database.

#### Example

- One possible way security can be impacted with the `AuthorizeDBSecurityGroupIngress` event in AWS RDS is if an unauthorized IP address or range is added to the security group's inbound rules. This can potentially allow unauthorized access to the RDS instance.

Remediation:
1. Identify the unauthorized IP address or range that was added to the security group.
2. Remove the unauthorized entry from the security group's inbound rules using the `revoke-db-security-group-ingress` command in AWS CLI:

```
aws rds revoke-db-security-group-ingress --db-security-group-name <security-group-name> --cidrip <unauthorized-ip-address-or-range>
```

3. Monitor the security group's inbound rules regularly to ensure that only authorized IP addresses or ranges are allowed access.
