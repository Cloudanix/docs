### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The ModifyDBCluster event in AWS RDS refers to a change or modification made to a database cluster.
- This event is triggered when there are updates or alterations made to the configuration or settings of an RDS database cluster.
- It can include changes such as modifying the cluster size, enabling or disabling features, adjusting storage capacity, or modifying network settings.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: 
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the ModifyDBCluster event in AWS RDS, they could potentially modify the database cluster configuration, such as increasing the allocated storage, changing the backup retention period, or modifying the security group rules. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or disruption of service.

2. Remediation:
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture all API calls made to RDS and store the logs in an S3 bucket. This will help in auditing and monitoring any unauthorized modifications to the RDS cluster.
   - Implement IAM policies with the principle of least privilege to restrict access to the ModifyDBCluster event. Only authorized users or roles should have the necessary permissions to modify the RDS cluster configuration.
   - Regularly review and rotate IAM credentials to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. Use AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely store and manage the credentials.

3. Bash script to enable CloudTrail for RDS:
   ```bash
   aws cloudtrail create-trail --name my-rds-trail --s3-bucket-name my-log-bucket --is-multi-region-trail
   aws cloudtrail start-logging --name my-rds-trail
   ```

Note: The above script assumes that you have already created an S3 bucket to store the CloudTrail logs. Replace `my-rds-trail` with your desired trail name and `my-log-bucket` with the name of your S3 bucket.
