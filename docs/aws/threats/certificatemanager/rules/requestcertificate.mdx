### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The RequestCertificate event in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) refers to the action of requesting a new SSL/TLS certificate for a domain or subdomain.
- This event is triggered when a user or application initiates the process of obtaining a certificate from ACM.
- The RequestCertificate event is an important step in securing web applications and enabling HTTPS communication by obtaining a trusted certificate from ACM.

#### Example

- One possible example of how security can be impacted with the RequestCertificate event in AWS Certificate Manager is if an unauthorized user or entity is able to request a certificate for a domain they do not own or have control over. This can lead to potential security risks such as man-in-the-middle attacks or impersonation.

Remediation:
1. Implement strict access controls and permissions for the AWS Certificate Manager service. Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to request certificates.
2. Enable certificate validation options such as DNS validation or email validation to ensure that the requester has control over the domain for which the certificate is being requested.
3. Monitor and review certificate request logs and events regularly to detect any unauthorized or suspicious activity. Implement automated alerts or notifications for any abnormal certificate request patterns.

AWS CLI command for enabling DNS validation for certificate requests:
```
aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --validation-method DNS
```

AWS CLI command for enabling email validation for certificate requests:
```
aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --validation-method EMAIL
```

Note: The above commands are just examples and should be customized based on the specific domain and validation method requirements.
