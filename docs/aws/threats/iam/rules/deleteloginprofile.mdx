### Event Information

- The DeleteLoginProfile event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of deleting a user's login profile within the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.
- When this event occurs, it means that the login profile, which includes the user's password and password reset information, has been removed for a specific IAM user.
- This event is typically triggered when an administrator or the user themselves decides to disable or remove the ability for the user to log in using a password, and instead rely on other authentication methods such as federated login or AWS Single Sign-On (SSO).


### Examples

- Unauthorized deletion of a user's login profile: If an attacker gains access to an IAM user's credentials, they can use the DeleteLoginProfile API to delete the user's login profile, effectively denying them access to the AWS account. This can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

- Disruption of user access management: Accidental or malicious use of the DeleteLoginProfile API can disrupt the management of user access within an AWS account. If a user's login profile is deleted, they will no longer be able to log in and perform their assigned tasks, causing operational issues and potential downtime.

- Compliance and audit concerns: Deleting a user's login profile without proper authorization or documentation can lead to compliance and audit concerns. Organizations may be required to maintain a record of user access and actions for regulatory purposes, and unauthorized deletion of login profiles can hinder the ability to demonstrate compliance.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Example 1: Enforce strong password policy for IAM users
   - Step 1: Login to the AWS Management Console.
   - Step 2: Go to the IAM service.
   - Step 3: Click on "Account settings" in the left navigation pane.
   - Step 4: Under the "Password policy" section, click on "Edit".
   - Step 5: Enable the "Require at least one uppercase letter" option.
   - Step 6: Enable the "Require at least one lowercase letter" option.
   - Step 7: Enable the "Require at least one number" option.
   - Step 8: Enable the "Require at least one non-alphanumeric character" option.
   - Step 9: Set the "Minimum password length" to an appropriate value.
   - Step 10: Click on "Apply password policy".

2. Example 2: Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users
   - Step 1: Login to the AWS Management Console.
   - Step 2: Go to the IAM service.
   - Step 3: Click on "Users" in the left navigation pane.
   - Step 4: Select the IAM user for which you want to enable MFA.
   - Step 5: Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
   - Step 6: Under the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, click on "Manage".
   - Step 7: Click on "Activate MFA".
   - Step 8: Choose the appropriate MFA device option (e.g., virtual MFA device, hardware MFA device).
   - Step 9: Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the MFA device.
   - Step 10: Click on "Assign MFA".

3. Example 3: Enable AWS CloudTrail for logging IAM events
   - Step 1: Login to the AWS Management Console.
   - Step 2: Go to the CloudTrail service.
   - Step 3: Click on "Trails" in the left navigation pane.
   - Step 4: Click on "Create trail".
   - Step 5: Provide a name for the trail and choose the appropriate settings (e.g., log file validation, S3 bucket for storing logs).
   - Step 6: Under the "Management events" section, enable logging for IAM events.
   - Step 7: Click on "Create".
   - Step 8: Once the trail is created, go to the IAM service.
   - Step 9: Click on "Policies" in the left navigation pane.
   - Step 10: Create a new IAM policy that allows the necessary permissions for accessing and reading the CloudTrail logs.

#### Using CLI

1. Ensure IAM users have strong passwords:
   - Use the `update-login-profile` command to set a strong password for an IAM user:
     ```
     aws iam update-login-profile --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME> --password <NEW_PASSWORD> --password-reset-required
     ```

2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users:
   - Use the `enable-mfa-device` command to enable MFA for an IAM user:
     ```
     aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME> --serial-number <MFA_DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER> --authentication-code1 <CODE1> --authentication-code2 <CODE2>
     ```

3. Remove unnecessary IAM access keys:
   - Use the `delete-access-key` command to delete an IAM access key:
     ```
     aws iam delete-access-key --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME> --access-key-id <ACCESS_KEY_ID>
     ```

#### Using Python

1. Ensure IAM users have strong passwords:
   - Use the `boto3` library in Python to retrieve a list of IAM users.
   - For each user, check if their password is strong by validating it against a set of password complexity rules.
   - If a user's password is weak, use the `update_login_profile` method to force a password reset for that user.

```python
import boto3
import re

def check_password_complexity(password):
    # Implement your password complexity rules here
    # Example: Password must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit
    if len(password) < 8 or not re.search(r'[A-Z]', password) or not re.search(r'[a-z]', password) or not re.search(r'\d', password):
        return False
    return True

def remediate_weak_passwords():
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
    users = iam_client.list_users()['Users']
    
    for user in users:
        login_profile = iam_client.get_login_profile(UserName=user['UserName'])
        if 'LoginProfile' in login_profile:
            password = login_profile['LoginProfile'].get('Password')
            if password and not check_password_complexity(password):
                iam_client.update_login_profile(UserName=user['UserName'], PasswordResetRequired=True)

remediate_weak_passwords()
```

2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users:
   - Use the `boto3` library in Python to retrieve a list of IAM users.
   - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by calling the `list_mfa_devices` method.
   - If MFA is not enabled, use the `enable_mfa` method to enable it for the user.

```python
import boto3

def remediate_missing_mfa():
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
    users = iam_client.list_users()['Users']
    
    for user in users:
        mfa_devices = iam_client.list_mfa_devices(UserName=user['UserName'])['MFADevices']
        if not mfa_devices:
            iam_client.enable_mfa(UserName=user['UserName'])

remediate_missing_mfa()
```

3. Remove unused IAM access keys:
   - Use the `boto3` library in Python to retrieve a list of IAM users.
   - For each user, check if they have any access keys by calling the `list_access_keys` method.
   - If the user has unused access keys (not used in the last 90 days), use the `delete_access_key` method to remove them.

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def remediate_unused_access_keys():
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
    users = iam_client.list_users()['Users']
    cutoff_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=90)
    
    for user in users:
        access_keys = iam_client.list_access_keys(UserName=user['UserName'])['AccessKeyMetadata']
        for access_key in access_keys:
            last_used = access_key.get('LastUsedDate')
            if last_used and last_used < cutoff_date:
                iam_client.delete_access_key(UserName=user['UserName'], AccessKeyId=access_key['AccessKeyId'])

remediate_unused_access_keys()
```
