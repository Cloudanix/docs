### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteSSHPublicKey event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of deleting an SSH public key associated with an IAM user.
- This event is triggered when an administrator or the IAM user themselves removes an SSH public key from their IAM user account.
- The DeleteSSHPublicKey event is important for auditing and tracking changes made to SSH public keys, ensuring the security and access control of the IAM user accounts.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteSSHPublicKey in AWS IAM, an example could be an unauthorized user gaining access to an IAM user's SSH public key and deleting it. This could potentially allow the unauthorized user to gain unauthorized access to the system or resources associated with the IAM user.

- Remediation Steps using AWS Console:
  1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
  2. Open the IAM console.
  3. In the navigation pane, choose "Users".
  4. Select the IAM user for whom you want to remediate the issue.
  5. In the "Security credentials" tab, locate the "SSH keys for AWS CodeCommit" section.
  6. Click on "Manage SSH keys".
  7. Review the existing SSH public keys and ensure that they are valid and authorized.
  8. If any unauthorized or suspicious SSH public keys are found, click on the "Delete" button next to them to remove them.
  9. Regularly monitor and review the SSH keys associated with IAM users to ensure their integrity and security.
  10. Consider enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security to their accounts.

Note: It is important to regularly review and monitor IAM users' SSH keys to detect and remediate any unauthorized changes or access. Additionally, implementing strong IAM policies and regularly rotating SSH keys can further enhance security.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If an attacker gains unauthorized access to an IAM user's credentials and uses the `DeleteSSHPublicKey` action, they can delete the SSH public keys associated with the IAM user. This can potentially compromise the security of the user's SSH access to AWS resources.

To remediate this security impact in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Enable AWS CloudTrail: Enable CloudTrail to capture API activity logs for your AWS account. This will help in monitoring and auditing the `DeleteSSHPublicKey` action.

2. Implement Least Privilege: Ensure that IAM users have the minimum required permissions to perform their tasks. Restrict the `DeleteSSHPublicKey` action to only authorized users or roles.

3. Regularly Monitor CloudTrail Logs: Continuously monitor the CloudTrail logs for any unauthorized or suspicious activity related to the `DeleteSSHPublicKey` action. You can use the AWS CLI command `aws cloudtrail lookup-events` to retrieve and analyze the CloudTrail events.

Example CLI commands:
- Enable CloudTrail: `aws cloudtrail create-trail --name my-trail --s3-bucket-name my-bucket --is-multi-region-trail`
- Restrict IAM permissions: `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name my-user --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/my-policy`
- Lookup CloudTrail events: `aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=DeleteSSHPublicKey`

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with DeleteSSHPublicKey in AWS IAM:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to an IAM user's credentials and performs the DeleteSSHPublicKey action, they can remove the SSH public key associated with the IAM user. This can lead to unauthorized access to the user's resources or systems.

2. Remediation for AWS IAM using Python:
   - To remediate this security issue, you can implement a script in Python that regularly checks for any unauthorized changes to SSH public keys associated with IAM users. Here's an example script:

```python
import boto3

def check_ssh_public_keys():
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

    # Get a list of all IAM users
    response = iam_client.list_users()

    for user in response['Users']:
        username = user['UserName']

        # Get the SSH public keys for the user
        response = iam_client.list_ssh_public_keys(UserName=username)

        for ssh_key in response['SSHPublicKeys']:
            ssh_key_id = ssh_key['SSHPublicKeyId']

            # Check if the SSH public key is active
            if ssh_key['Status'] != 'Active':
                print(f"Warning: SSH public key {ssh_key_id} for user {username} is not active.")

            # Check if the SSH public key is associated with any IAM user
            response = iam_client.get_ssh_public_key(UserName=username, SSHPublicKeyId=ssh_key_id, Encoding='SSH')

            if 'SSHPublicKey' not in response:
                print(f"Warning: SSH public key {ssh_key_id} for user {username} is not associated with any IAM user.")

check_ssh_public_keys()
```

This script uses the Boto3 library to interact with the AWS IAM service. It retrieves a list of all IAM users and checks the status and association of their SSH public keys. If any issues are found, it prints a warning message. You can schedule this script to run periodically to ensure the integrity of SSH public keys in your AWS IAM environment.
