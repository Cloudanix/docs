### Event Information

- The DeleteSSHPublicKey event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of deleting an SSH public key associated with an IAM user.
- This event is triggered when an administrator or the IAM user themselves removes an SSH public key from their IAM user account.
- The DeleteSSHPublicKey event is important for auditing and tracking changes made to SSH public keys in IAM, ensuring that only authorized keys are associated with IAM users.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized access: If an attacker gains access to an IAM user's credentials and uses the DeleteSSHPublicKey API, they can remove the SSH public key associated with the user. This can potentially allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the user's resources or perform malicious actions.

2. Privilege escalation: If an IAM user with elevated privileges, such as an administrator, is compromised, an attacker can use the DeleteSSHPublicKey API to remove SSH public keys associated with other IAM users. This can lead to privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access to resources or perform actions on behalf of other users.

3. Audit trail manipulation: The DeleteSSHPublicKey API can be used to remove SSH public keys associated with IAM users, potentially erasing evidence of unauthorized access or actions. This can hinder incident response efforts and make it difficult to identify and mitigate security breaches in a timely manner. It is important to have proper monitoring and logging mechanisms in place to detect and respond to such activities.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized access:
- Step 1: Identify the compromised IAM user by reviewing logs, monitoring tools, or security alerts.
- Step 2: Disable the compromised IAM user's access by removing their permissions or disabling their account.
- Step 3: Reset the IAM user's credentials, including their access keys and password.
- Step 4: Review and update the IAM user's permissions to ensure they only have the necessary access required for their role.
- Step 5: Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the IAM user to add an extra layer of security.

2. Privilege escalation:
- Step 1: Identify the compromised IAM user with elevated privileges, such as an administrator.
- Step 2: Disable the compromised IAM user's access by removing their permissions or disabling their account.
- Step 3: Reset the IAM user's credentials, including their access keys and password.
- Step 4: Review and update the IAM user's permissions to ensure they only have the necessary access required for their role.
- Step 5: Implement least privilege principles by granting the IAM user only the minimum permissions needed to perform their tasks.

3. Audit trail disruption:
- Step 1: Enable CloudTrail logging to capture API calls and user activities.
- Step 2: Regularly review CloudTrail logs to identify any suspicious activities or deletions of SSH public keys.
- Step 3: Implement log integrity controls to prevent tampering or deletion of logs.
- Step 4: Implement real-time monitoring and alerting to detect any unauthorized modifications to SSH public keys.
- Step 5: Regularly backup and store CloudTrail logs in a secure location to ensure availability for incident response and forensic investigations.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized access:
- Disable the DeleteSSHPublicKey API for IAM users to prevent unauthorized removal of SSH public keys.
- Regularly rotate IAM user credentials and enforce strong password policies to minimize the risk of credential compromise.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security.

2. Privilege escalation:
- Implement the principle of least privilege by assigning IAM users with only the necessary permissions required to perform their tasks.
- Regularly review and audit IAM user privileges to identify and revoke unnecessary elevated privileges.
- Monitor and analyze IAM user activity logs to detect any suspicious or unauthorized actions.

3. Audit trail disruption:
- Enable CloudTrail to capture API activity logs, including the DeleteSSHPublicKey API, for IAM users.
- Store CloudTrail logs in a secure and centralized location to ensure their integrity and availability.
- Regularly review and analyze CloudTrail logs to identify any unauthorized or suspicious activities and take appropriate actions.

CLI commands:
- To disable the DeleteSSHPublicKey API for IAM users:
  `aws iam update-account-configuration --no-allow-users-to-manage-ssh-public-keys`

- To enable MFA for an IAM user:
  `aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME> --serial-number <MFA_DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER> --authentication-code1 <CODE1> --authentication-code2 <CODE2>`

- To enable CloudTrail for API activity logging:
  `aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <TRAIL_NAME> --s3-bucket-name <S3_BUCKET_NAME> --is-multi-region-trail --include-global-service-events`

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized access:
- Regularly rotate IAM user credentials to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. This can be done using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) by calling the `update_access_key` method to create a new access key and delete the old one.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security. This can be achieved by using the `create_virtual_mfa_device` and `enable_mfa_device` methods in Boto3.

2. Privilege escalation:
- Implement the principle of least privilege by assigning IAM users with the minimum required permissions. This can be done by using the `create_policy` and `attach_user_policy` methods in Boto3 to create and attach a custom IAM policy to restrict user privileges.
- Regularly review and audit IAM user privileges to identify and remove any unnecessary elevated privileges. This can be achieved by using the `list_attached_user_policies` and `detach_user_policy` methods in Boto3.

3. Audit trail disruption:
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity and store logs in a secure S3 bucket. This can be done using the `create_trail` and `start_logging` methods in Boto3.
- Implement real-time monitoring and alerting on CloudTrail logs to detect any suspicious activities. This can be achieved by integrating CloudTrail with services like Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Lambda using the `put_metric_filter` and `put_rule` methods in Boto3.
