### Event Information

- The DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of deleting the account-level password policy for an IAM user or role.
- This event signifies that the password policy, which defines the requirements and constraints for user passwords within an AWS account, has been removed.
- Deleting the account password policy allows users and roles to set passwords without any specific requirements or constraints, potentially compromising the security of the account.


### Examples

1. Weakening of password complexity: If the DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy action is performed in AWS IAM, it will remove the account-level password policy. This means that users will no longer be required to create strong passwords with a certain level of complexity. This can lead to weaker passwords being used, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to the AWS account.

2. Lack of password expiration: The DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy action also removes the ability to enforce password expiration for IAM users. Without password expiration, users may continue to use the same password indefinitely, increasing the risk of compromised credentials going undetected for extended periods of time.

3. Absence of password reuse prevention: By removing the account-level password policy, the DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy action also eliminates the ability to prevent users from reusing their previous passwords. This can make it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access to the AWS account by exploiting reused passwords that may have been compromised in the past.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the weakening of password complexity, lack of password expiration, and absence of password reuse prevention in AWS IAM using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console.
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Account settings."
3. On the "Account settings" page, locate the "Password policy" section.
4. Click on the "Edit" button next to the "Password policy" section.
5. Configure the desired password complexity requirements by setting the minimum password length, requiring at least one uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and special character.
6. Enable the "Require password expiration" option and set the maximum password age to enforce regular password changes.
7. Enable the "Prevent password reuse" option to disallow users from reusing their previous passwords.
8. Click on the "Apply password policy" button to save the changes.

By following these steps, you can remediate the weakening of password complexity, lack of password expiration, and absence of password reuse prevention in AWS IAM, ensuring stronger security measures for your AWS account.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate weakening of password complexity in AWS IAM, you can use the `put-account-password-policy` command in AWS CLI to set a strong password policy. For example:
```
aws iam put-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 12 --require-symbols --require-numbers --require-uppercase-characters --require-lowercase-characters --allow-users-to-change-password
```
This command sets a minimum password length of 12 characters and requires the use of symbols, numbers, uppercase and lowercase characters. It also allows users to change their passwords.

2. To remediate the lack of password expiration in AWS IAM, you can use the `update-account-password-policy` command in AWS CLI to enable password expiration. For example:
```
aws iam update-account-password-policy --password-expiration-days 90
```
This command sets the password expiration period to 90 days, after which users will be required to change their passwords.

3. To remediate the absence of password reuse prevention in AWS IAM, you can use the `update-account-password-policy` command in AWS CLI to enable password reuse prevention. For example:
```
aws iam update-account-password-policy --password-reuse-prevention 5
```
This command sets the password reuse prevention to 5, meaning that users will not be able to reuse their previous 5 passwords when creating a new password.

#### Using Python

To remediate the weakening of password complexity, lack of password expiration, and absence of password reuse prevention in AWS IAM using Python, you can use the following scripts:

1. Strengthening password complexity:
```python
import boto3

# Create a new password policy
client = boto3.client('iam')
response = client.update_account_password_policy(
    MinimumPasswordLength=12,
    RequireSymbols=True,
    RequireNumbers=True,
    RequireUppercaseCharacters=True,
    RequireLowercaseCharacters=True,
    AllowUsersToChangePassword=True,
    MaxPasswordAge=90,
    PasswordReusePrevention=5
)
```

2. Enforcing password expiration:
```python
import boto3

# Enable password expiration for IAM users
client = boto3.client('iam')
response = client.update_account_password_policy(
    MaxPasswordAge=90
)
```

3. Preventing password reuse:
```python
import boto3

# Set password reuse prevention for IAM users
client = boto3.client('iam')
response = client.update_account_password_policy(
    PasswordReusePrevention=5
)
```

These scripts use the `boto3` library to interact with the AWS IAM service. The `update_account_password_policy` method is used to modify the account-level password policy. Adjust the parameters in the scripts according to your desired password complexity requirements, password expiration period, and password reuse prevention threshold.
