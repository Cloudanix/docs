### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of deleting the account-level password policy for an IAM user or role.
- This event signifies that the password policy, which defines the requirements and constraints for user passwords within an AWS account, has been removed.
- Deleting the account password policy allows users and roles to set passwords without any specific requirements or constraints, potentially compromising the security of the account.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If the DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy is enabled in AWS IAM, it means that the account password policy can be deleted by any IAM user. This can lead to a security risk as it allows unauthorized users to modify the password policy settings, potentially weakening the overall security of the AWS account.

To remediate this issue for AWS IAM using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using your IAM user credentials.
2. Open the IAM console.
3. In the navigation pane, choose "Account settings".
4. On the "Account settings" page, locate the "Password policy" section.
5. Click on the "Edit" button next to the "Password policy" section.
6. In the "Password policy" editor, ensure that the "Allow users to change their own password" option is selected.
7. Scroll down to the "Delete account password policy" section and uncheck the checkbox.
8. Click on the "Apply password policy" button to save the changes.

By following these steps, you will remediate the issue by disabling the ability for IAM users to delete the account password policy, thereby enhancing the security of your AWS IAM environment.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If the DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy is set to "true" in AWS IAM, it means that the account password policy is deleted, which can have a significant impact on security. This policy is responsible for enforcing password complexity requirements, such as minimum length, character requirements, and password expiration.

- Remediation steps using AWS CLI:
  1. First, check the current status of the DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy by running the following command:
     ```
     aws iam get-account-password-policy
     ```

  2. If the DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy is set to "true", you need to re-enable it. Run the following command to set a new password policy:
     ```
     aws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 8 --require-symbols --require-numbers --require-uppercase-characters --require-lowercase-characters --allow-users-to-change-password --max-password-age 90
     ```

     This command sets a new password policy with a minimum length of 8 characters, requiring symbols, numbers, uppercase and lowercase characters, allowing users to change their passwords, and setting a maximum password age of 90 days. You can modify these parameters as per your organization's requirements.

  3. Finally, verify that the password policy has been successfully updated by running the following command:
     ```
     aws iam get-account-password-policy
     ```

     Ensure that the DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy is now set to "false" and the new password policy is in effect.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute these commands.

#### Using Python

1. Impact on Security: The `DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy` action in AWS IAM allows the deletion of the account-level password policy. This can have a significant impact on security as it removes the restrictions and requirements set for password complexity, expiration, and other security measures. Without a password policy, users may choose weak passwords or keep the same password for an extended period, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

2. Remediation using Python: To remediate this issue and ensure a password policy is always in place, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to create a script that automatically applies the desired password policy settings. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```python
import boto3

def remediate_password_policy():
    # Create a Boto3 IAM client
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

    # Define the desired password policy settings
    password_policy = {
        'MinimumPasswordLength': 12,
        'RequireSymbols': True,
        'RequireNumbers': True,
        'RequireUppercaseCharacters': True,
        'RequireLowercaseCharacters': True,
        'AllowUsersToChangePassword': True,
        'ExpirePasswords': True,
        'MaxPasswordAge': 90
    }

    # Update the password policy
    iam_client.update_account_password_policy(**password_policy)

# Call the function to remediate the password policy
remediate_password_policy()
```

This script uses the `update_account_password_policy` method of the IAM client to update the account-level password policy with the desired settings. Adjust the `password_policy` dictionary according to your specific requirements.

Please note that this script assumes you have the necessary IAM permissions to update the account password policy.
