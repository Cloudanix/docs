### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The SetDefaultPolicyVersion event in AWS IAM refers to the action of setting a specific policy version as the default version for a particular IAM policy.
- This event is triggered when an IAM user or role updates the default version of a policy using the `SetDefaultPolicyVersion` API operation.
- The purpose of setting a default policy version is to ensure that all IAM entities (users, roles, groups) that are attached to the policy automatically use the latest version of the policy without needing to explicitly specify the version number.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and triggers the SetDefaultPolicyVersion event for IAM, they can potentially modify the default policy version associated with an IAM role or user. This can lead to unauthorized access to resources or privilege escalation, compromising the security of the AWS environment.

Remediation:
- Regularly monitor and review IAM policies and roles to identify any unauthorized changes.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture all API calls related to IAM and set up alerts for any modifications to default policy versions.
- Implement strong access controls, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and least privilege principles, to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
- Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict the ability to modify default policy versions to trusted administrators only.
- Regularly rotate access keys and credentials to minimize the impact of compromised credentials.

Example CLI command to list IAM roles with default policy versions:
```
aws iam list-roles --query 'Roles[?DefaultPolicyVersionId!=null].[RoleName, Arn, DefaultPolicyVersionId]' --output table
```

2. Example of security impact: If a malicious insider gains access to the AWS account and triggers the SetDefaultPolicyVersion event for IAM, they can modify the default policy version to grant themselves excessive privileges. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, unauthorized modification of resources, or even complete control over the AWS environment.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls, such as least privilege principles, to ensure that IAM roles and users have only the necessary permissions.
- Regularly review and audit IAM policies to identify any overly permissive policies or unnecessary permissions.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture all API calls related to IAM and set up alerts for any modifications to default policy versions.
- Implement strict monitoring and logging practices to detect any suspicious activities related to IAM.
- Regularly rotate access keys and credentials to minimize the impact of compromised credentials.

Example CLI command to list IAM users with default policy versions:
```
aws iam list-users --query 'Users[?DefaultPolicyVersionId!=null].[UserName, Arn, DefaultPolicyVersionId]' --output table
```

3. Example of security impact: If a misconfiguration or vulnerability in the AWS environment allows unauthorized access to the SetDefaultPolicyVersion event for IAM, an attacker can modify the default policy version to grant themselves elevated privileges. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, unauthorized modification of resources, or even complete control over the AWS environment.

Remediation:
- Regularly perform security assessments and vulnerability scans to identify and address any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the AWS environment.
- Implement strong access controls, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and least privilege principles, to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture all API calls related to IAM and set up alerts for any modifications to default policy versions.
- Implement strict monitoring and logging practices to detect any suspicious activities related to IAM.
- Regularly rotate access keys and credentials to minimize the impact of compromised credentials.

Example CLI command to list IAM roles and users with default policy versions:
```
aws iam list-roles --query 'Roles[?DefaultPolicyVersionId!=null].[RoleName, Arn, DefaultPolicyVersionId]' --output table
aws iam list-users --query 'Users[?DefaultPolicyVersionId!=null].[UserName, Arn, DefaultPolicyVersionId]' --output table
```
