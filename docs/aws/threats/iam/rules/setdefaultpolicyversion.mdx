### Event Information

- The SetDefaultPolicyVersion event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of setting a specific policy version as the default version for a particular IAM policy.
- When this event occurs, it means that the default version of the policy has been updated, and any new IAM roles or users that are assigned this policy will automatically use the newly set default version.
- This event is useful for managing and controlling the access and permissions of IAM entities, as it allows for the easy management of policy versions and ensures that the most up-to-date version is being used by default.


### Examples

1. Inadvertently granting excessive permissions: When using SetDefaultPolicyVersion in AWS IAM, there is a risk of inadvertently setting a policy version that grants excessive permissions to users or roles. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources and compromise the security of the system.

2. Failure to enforce least privilege principle: Setting a default policy version without careful consideration can result in a failure to enforce the principle of least privilege. This means that users or roles may have more permissions than necessary, increasing the attack surface and making it easier for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities.

3. Lack of visibility and control: By setting a default policy version, it becomes more challenging to have granular visibility and control over individual permissions. This can make it difficult to track and manage access to resources, leading to potential security gaps and difficulties in auditing and compliance efforts.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Inadvertently granting excessive permissions:
- Step 1: Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.
- Step 2: Select "Policies" from the left-hand menu.
- Step 3: Locate the policy for which you want to set the default version and click on its name.
- Step 4: In the policy details page, click on the "Versions" tab.
- Step 5: Review the existing policy versions and identify the version that grants the appropriate permissions.
- Step 6: Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu next to the desired version and select "Set as default version".
- Step 7: A confirmation dialog will appear, click "Set as default version" to confirm the change.

2. Failure to enforce least privilege:
- Follow steps 1 to 4 from the previous response.
- Step 5: Review the existing policy versions and identify the version that enforces the principle of least privilege.
- Step 6: Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu next to the desired version and select "Set as default version".
- Step 7: A confirmation dialog will appear, click "Set as default version" to confirm the change.

3. Lack of visibility and control:
- Follow steps 1 to 4 from the first response.
- Step 5: Review the existing policy versions and identify the version that provides the necessary visibility and control.
- Step 6: Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu next to the desired version and select "Set as default version".
- Step 7: A confirmation dialog will appear, click "Set as default version" to confirm the change.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate inadvertently granting excessive permissions in AWS IAM using AWS CLI commands, you can:
   - Use the `aws iam list-policies` command to list all the policies in your AWS account.
   - Review the policies and identify the policy that grants excessive permissions.
   - Use the `aws iam delete-policy-version` command to delete the specific policy version that grants excessive permissions.
   - Ensure that you have a backup of the policy version before deleting it.

2. To remediate failure to enforce least privilege in AWS IAM using AWS CLI commands, you can:
   - Use the `aws iam list-attached-user-policies` and `aws iam list-attached-role-policies` commands to list the policies attached to users and roles.
   - Review the policies and identify the ones that grant more permissions than necessary.
   - Use the `aws iam detach-user-policy` and `aws iam detach-role-policy` commands to detach the excessive policies from the users and roles.
   - Create and attach new policies with the principle of least privilege.

3. To remediate lack of visibility and control in AWS IAM using AWS CLI commands, you can:
   - Use the `aws iam list-users`, `aws iam list-roles`, and `aws iam list-groups` commands to list all the users, roles, and groups in your AWS account.
   - Review the entities and their associated policies to identify any inconsistencies or excessive permissions.
   - Use the `aws iam list-attached-user-policies`, `aws iam list-attached-role-policies`, and `aws iam list-attached-group-policies` commands to list the policies attached to users, roles, and groups.
   - Review the policies and make necessary changes to ensure compliance with security best practices and regulatory requirements.

#### Using Python

1. To remediate inadvertently granting excessive permissions in AWS IAM using Python scripts, you can:
   - Implement a script that regularly scans and analyzes the IAM policies in your AWS environment.
   - Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to retrieve the policy versions and their associated permissions.
   - Compare the permissions against a predefined set of least privilege principles or a baseline policy.
   - Identify any policies that grant excessive permissions and take appropriate actions, such as removing or modifying the policy.

2. To remediate the failure to enforce least privilege in AWS IAM using Python scripts, you can:
   - Develop a script that evaluates the permissions assigned to each user or role in your AWS environment.
   - Utilize Boto3 to retrieve the user or role policies and their associated permissions.
   - Compare the permissions against a predefined set of least privilege principles or a baseline policy.
   - Identify any users or roles that have more permissions than necessary and take corrective actions, such as modifying their policies or removing unnecessary permissions.

3. To address the lack of visibility and control in AWS IAM using Python scripts, you can:
   - Create a script that regularly audits and monitors the IAM policies and permissions.
   - Use Boto3 to retrieve the policies, permissions, and associated entities (users, roles, groups).
   - Implement logic to analyze and report on any deviations from security best practices or compliance requirements.
   - Generate alerts or notifications for any unauthorized or suspicious access attempts.
   - Automate the enforcement of security policies by modifying or revoking permissions as needed.
