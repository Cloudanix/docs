### Event Information

- The SetDefaultPolicyVersion event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of setting a specific policy version as the default version for a particular IAM policy.
- When this event occurs, it means that the default version of the policy has been updated, and any new IAM roles or users that are assigned this policy will automatically use the newly set default version.
- This event is useful for managing and controlling the access and permissions of IAM entities within an AWS account, ensuring that the most up-to-date and desired policy version is applied by default.


### Examples

1. Inadvertently granting excessive permissions: When using SetDefaultPolicyVersion in AWS IAM, there is a risk of inadvertently setting a policy version that grants excessive permissions to users or roles. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive resources or data within the AWS environment.

2. Failure to enforce least privilege: Setting the default policy version without careful consideration can lead to a failure in enforcing the principle of least privilege. This means that users or roles may have more permissions than necessary, increasing the attack surface and potential impact of security breaches.

3. Lack of visibility and control: Changing the default policy version without proper documentation and monitoring can lead to a lack of visibility and control over the permissions granted to users or roles. This can make it difficult to track and manage security incidents, audit access, and ensure compliance with security policies and regulations.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Inadvertently granting excessive permissions:
- Step 1: Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.
- Step 2: Select "Policies" from the left-hand menu.
- Step 3: Locate the policy for which you want to set the default version and click on its name.
- Step 4: In the policy details page, click on the "Versions" tab.
- Step 5: Identify the version that grants the desired permissions and click on the "Set as default version" button next to it.
- Step 6: Review the changes and ensure that the default version does not grant excessive permissions.
- Step 7: Click on "Save changes" to set the default policy version.

2. Failure to enforce least privilege principle:
- Follow steps 1 to 4 from the previous response.
- Step 5: Identify the version that enforces the principle of least privilege and click on the "Set as default version" button next to it.
- Step 6: Review the changes and ensure that the default version enforces the least privilege principle.
- Step 7: Click on "Save changes" to set the default policy version.

3. Lack of visibility and control:
- Follow steps 1 to 4 from the first response.
- Step 5: Identify the version that provides the desired visibility and control over individual permissions and click on the "Set as default version" button next to it.
- Step 6: Review the changes and ensure that the default version provides the necessary visibility and control.
- Step 7: Click on "Save changes" to set the default policy version.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate inadvertently granting excessive permissions in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:
   - Use the `aws iam list-policies` command to list all the policies in your account.
   - Identify the policy that has the excessive permissions and note down its ARN.
   - Use the `aws iam delete-policy-version` command to delete the specific policy version that grants excessive permissions. Specify the policy ARN and the version ID to be deleted.

2. To remediate the failure to enforce the least privilege principle in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, you can take the following actions:
   - Use the `aws iam list-policies` command to list all the policies in your account.
   - Identify the policies that are not following the least privilege principle and note down their ARNs.
   - Use the `aws iam delete-policy-version` command to delete the specific policy versions that grant unnecessary permissions. Specify the policy ARN and the version ID to be deleted.

3. To address the lack of visibility and control in AWS IAM when using a default policy version, you can perform the following steps:
   - Use the `aws iam list-policies` command to list all the policies in your account.
   - Identify the policies that are set as the default policy version and note down their ARNs.
   - Use the `aws iam delete-policy-version` command to delete the default policy versions. Specify the policy ARN and the version ID to be deleted. Additionally, consider creating and attaching individual policies to users or roles to have more granular control and visibility over permissions.

#### Using Python

1. Inadvertently granting excessive permissions:
- Regularly review and audit IAM policies to identify any policies that grant excessive permissions.
- Utilize AWS IAM Access Analyzer to automatically detect and remediate any policies that violate least privilege principles.
- Implement automated testing and validation processes to ensure that new policy versions do not grant excessive permissions.

2. Failure to enforce least privilege principle:
- Implement a robust IAM policy creation and review process that includes multiple levels of approval and validation.
- Utilize AWS IAM policy simulator to test and validate the permissions granted by a policy before setting it as the default policy version.
- Regularly review and update default policy versions to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.

3. Lack of visibility and control:
- Implement a centralized IAM policy management solution that provides granular visibility and control over individual permissions.
- Utilize AWS CloudTrail to track and monitor changes to IAM policies and permissions.
- Implement automated IAM policy enforcement and remediation processes to ensure consistent and compliant access control.
