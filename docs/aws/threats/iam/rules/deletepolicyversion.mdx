### Event Information

- The DeletePolicyVersion event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of deleting a specific version of an IAM policy.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process initiates the deletion of a policy version using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or API.
- It is important to note that deleting a policy version does not delete the entire policy, but only the specified version.


### Examples

1. Accidental deletion: If an IAM user or role with sufficient permissions accidentally deletes a policy version using the DeletePolicyVersion API, it can impact security by removing a valid and necessary policy version. This can result in unauthorized access or actions being allowed within the AWS environment.

2. Malicious intent: If an attacker gains access to an IAM user or role with the necessary permissions, they can use the DeletePolicyVersion API to remove critical policy versions. This can lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or the ability to perform malicious actions within the AWS environment.

3. Compliance violations: In certain compliance frameworks, it is required to maintain a history of policy versions for auditing purposes. If policy versions are deleted using the DeletePolicyVersion API without proper documentation or approval, it can result in compliance violations and potential penalties.

To mitigate these security impacts, it is important to carefully manage IAM permissions and access controls, regularly review and backup policy versions, and implement multi-factor authentication and strong access controls to prevent unauthorized access to IAM resources. Additionally, enabling AWS CloudTrail can provide detailed logs of API calls, including the DeletePolicyVersion API, for monitoring and auditing purposes.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Accidental deletion: To remediate accidental deletion of policy versions in AWS IAM using the AWS console, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
- Step 2: Open the IAM console.
- Step 3: Navigate to the "Policies" section.
- Step 4: Locate the policy that had a version accidentally deleted.
- Step 5: Click on the policy name to view its details.
- Step 6: In the "Policy versions" tab, click on the "Create version" button.
- Step 7: Provide the necessary details for the new policy version, such as the policy document.
- Step 8: Click on the "Create version" button to create the new policy version.
- Step 9: Review the policy versions and ensure that the accidentally deleted version is now restored.

2. Malicious intent: To remediate the deletion of critical policy versions due to malicious intent in AWS IAM using the AWS console, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Regularly review and monitor IAM policies to identify any unauthorized changes.
- Step 2: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users and roles to add an extra layer of security.
- Step 3: Restrict IAM permissions to only grant necessary access and regularly review and update these permissions.
- Step 4: Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture detailed logs of API calls, including the DeletePolicyVersion API.
- Step 5: Monitor CloudTrail logs for any suspicious activity related to policy version deletions.
- Step 6: If any unauthorized deletions are detected, immediately revoke the compromised IAM user or role's access and investigate the incident.

3. Compliance violations: To remediate compliance violations related to the deletion of policy versions in AWS IAM using the AWS console, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Establish a policy and process for managing policy versions, including documentation and approval requirements.
- Step 2: Regularly review and audit IAM policies to ensure compliance with the established policy and process.
- Step 3: Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture detailed logs of API calls, including the DeletePolicyVersion API.
- Step 4: Monitor CloudTrail logs for any unauthorized or undocumented policy version deletions.
- Step 5: If compliance violations are identified, take appropriate actions such as restoring deleted policy versions, documenting the incident, and implementing measures to prevent future violations.

#### Using CLI

1. Accidental deletion: To remediate accidental deletion of policy versions in AWS IAM using AWS CLI commands, you can follow these steps:

- Identify the deleted policy version by checking the CloudTrail logs or using the `list-policy-versions` command to list all versions of the policy.
- Use the `create-policy-version` command to recreate the deleted policy version. Specify the policy ARN, policy document, and set the `set-as-default` flag to true if necessary.
- Verify that the policy version has been successfully recreated by using the `list-policy-versions` command again.

Example CLI commands:
```
aws iam list-policy-versions --policy-arn <policy-arn>
aws iam create-policy-version --policy-arn <policy-arn> --policy-document <policy-document> --set-as-default
aws iam list-policy-versions --policy-arn <policy-arn>
```

2. Malicious intent: To remediate the deletion of critical policy versions due to malicious intent, you should take the following actions:

- Immediately revoke the compromised IAM user or role's access by disabling or deleting it.
- Restore the deleted policy version using the same steps mentioned in the previous point for accidental deletion.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the extent of the breach and take appropriate actions to prevent further unauthorized access.

Example CLI commands:
```
aws iam delete-user --user-name <user-name>
aws iam create-policy-version --policy-arn <policy-arn> --policy-document <policy-document> --set-as-default
```

3. Compliance violations: To remediate compliance violations caused by unauthorized deletion of policy versions, you can:

- Restore the deleted policy version using the steps mentioned in the first point for accidental deletion.
- Implement stricter access controls and permissions management to prevent unauthorized modifications to policy versions.
- Regularly review and monitor IAM policies to ensure compliance with the required policy version history.

Example CLI commands:
```
aws iam create-policy-version --policy-arn <policy-arn> --policy-document <policy-document> --set-as-default
```

#### Using Python

To remediate the risks associated with accidental deletion, malicious intent, and compliance violations in AWS IAM, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement IAM Best Practices:
   - Follow the principle of least privilege by granting only the necessary permissions to IAM users and roles.
   - Regularly review and update IAM policies to ensure they align with the current requirements.
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security.

2. Monitor and Audit IAM Policies:
   - Utilize AWS CloudTrail to capture detailed logs of API calls, including the DeletePolicyVersion API.
   - Set up CloudTrail alerts or integrate with AWS Config to receive notifications for policy version deletions.
   - Regularly review CloudTrail logs and investigate any suspicious or unauthorized activities.

3. Automate Policy Version Backups:
   - Use Python scripts to automate the backup of IAM policy versions.
   - Utilize the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with IAM APIs.
   - Write a script that retrieves all policy versions and stores them in a secure location, such as an S3 bucket or version control system.

Here's an example Python script that demonstrates how to retrieve and backup IAM policy versions using Boto3:

```python
import boto3

def backup_policy_versions():
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

    # Retrieve all IAM policies
    response = iam_client.list_policies()

    for policy in response['Policies']:
        policy_arn = policy['Arn']

        # Retrieve all policy versions for each policy
        versions_response = iam_client.list_policy_versions(PolicyArn=policy_arn)

        for version in versions_response['Versions']:
            version_id = version['VersionId']

            # Get the policy version document
            version_response = iam_client.get_policy_version(PolicyArn=policy_arn, VersionId=version_id)
            policy_document = version_response['PolicyVersion']['Document']

            # Backup the policy version document to a file or storage location
            backup_location = f"backup/{policy['PolicyName']}_v{version_id}.json"
            with open(backup_location, 'w') as backup_file:
                backup_file.write(policy_document)

backup_policy_versions()
```

Please note that this script is a basic example and may need to be customized based on your specific requirements and environment.
