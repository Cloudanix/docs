### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeletePolicyVersion event in AWS IAM refers to the action of deleting a specific version of an IAM policy.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process initiates the deletion of a policy version using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or API.
- The event provides information about the policy version that was deleted, including the policy version ID, policy ARN, and the user or entity that performed the deletion.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeletePolicyVersion event in AWS IAM:
   - An attacker gains unauthorized access to an IAM user or role with sufficient permissions to delete policy versions.
   - The attacker deletes a policy version that is currently being used by other IAM entities, such as users, roles, or groups.
   - As a result, the affected IAM entities lose the necessary permissions defined in the deleted policy version, potentially leading to unauthorized access or denial of service.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeletePolicyVersion event in AWS IAM:
   - Implement the principle of least privilege by regularly reviewing and limiting the permissions assigned to IAM users and roles.
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture and log all API activities related to IAM, including DeletePolicyVersion events.
   - Monitor CloudTrail logs for any suspicious or unauthorized DeletePolicyVersion events.
   - Regularly backup IAM policies and policy versions to ensure quick recovery in case of accidental or malicious deletions.
   - Implement versioning and lifecycle policies for IAM policies to prevent accidental deletion of critical policy versions.

3. Example CLI command for listing policy versions and their usage:
   ```
   aws iam list-policy-versions --policy-arn <policy-arn>
   ```
   This command lists all the versions of a specific IAM policy and provides information about their usage. It helps identify which policy versions are actively being used by IAM entities and should not be deleted.

Note: The provided CLI command assumes you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate credentials.
