### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteRole event in AWS IAM refers to the action of deleting an IAM role.
- When this event occurs, it indicates that a specific IAM role has been permanently removed from the AWS account.
- This event is important for auditing and monitoring purposes, as it helps track changes made to IAM roles and ensures proper governance and security of the AWS environment.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with a DeleteRole event in AWS IAM:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and deletes an IAM role, it can lead to potential security risks. The deleted role might have had permissions to access sensitive resources or perform critical actions within the account. This can result in unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruptions.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteRole event:
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture all API activities, including IAM role deletions. This will help in identifying the unauthorized user and understanding the scope of the impact.
   - Regularly review and monitor IAM roles to ensure that only necessary permissions are granted. Remove any unused or unnecessary roles to minimize the attack surface.
   - Implement the principle of least privilege by granting IAM roles only the permissions required for their intended purpose. Avoid granting excessive permissions that could be misused.

3. AWS CLI command to delete an IAM role (for remediation purposes):
   ```
   aws iam delete-role --role-name <role-name>
   ```
   Replace `<role-name>` with the name of the IAM role that needs to be deleted. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform this action.
