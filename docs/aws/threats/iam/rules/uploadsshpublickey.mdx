### Event Information

- The UploadSSHPublicKey event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of uploading an SSH public key to an IAM user's account.
- This event is typically used to enable SSH key-based authentication for the IAM user, allowing them to securely access AWS resources using SSH.
- By uploading an SSH public key, the IAM user can authenticate themselves without relying on traditional username/password credentials, enhancing security and convenience.


### Examples

- Unauthorized access: If the UploadSSHPublicKey operation is misused or abused, it can lead to unauthorized individuals gaining access to the AWS resources associated with the IAM user. This can result in data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or even complete compromise of the infrastructure.

- Weak or compromised SSH keys: If the SSH public key uploaded through UploadSSHPublicKey is weak or compromised, it can provide an entry point for attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. Weak keys can be easily cracked, while compromised keys may have been obtained through malicious means.

- Lack of proper access controls: If the IAM user's permissions are not properly configured, the UploadSSHPublicKey operation can be abused to grant excessive privileges to unauthorized individuals. This can lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, or unauthorized modifications to the infrastructure.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Example 1: Enforce strong password policy for IAM users
   - Step 1: Login to the AWS Management Console.
   - Step 2: Go to the IAM service.
   - Step 3: Click on "Account settings" in the left navigation pane.
   - Step 4: Under the "Password policy" section, click on "Edit".
   - Step 5: Enable the "Require at least one uppercase letter" option.
   - Step 6: Enable the "Require at least one lowercase letter" option.
   - Step 7: Enable the "Require at least one number" option.
   - Step 8: Enable the "Require at least one non-alphanumeric character" option.
   - Step 9: Set the "Minimum password length" to an appropriate value.
   - Step 10: Click on "Apply password policy".

2. Example 2: Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users
   - Step 1: Login to the AWS Management Console.
   - Step 2: Go to the IAM service.
   - Step 3: Click on "Users" in the left navigation pane.
   - Step 4: Select the IAM user for which you want to enable MFA.
   - Step 5: Click on the "Security credentials" tab.
   - Step 6: Under the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, click on "Manage".
   - Step 7: Click on "Activate MFA".
   - Step 8: Choose the appropriate MFA device option (e.g., virtual MFA device, hardware MFA device).
   - Step 9: Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the MFA device.
   - Step 10: Click on "Assign MFA".

3. Example 3: Enable AWS CloudTrail for logging IAM events
   - Step 1: Login to the AWS Management Console.
   - Step 2: Go to the CloudTrail service.
   - Step 3: Click on "Trails" in the left navigation pane.
   - Step 4: Click on "Create trail".
   - Step 5: Provide a name for the trail and choose the appropriate settings (e.g., log file validation, S3 bucket for storing logs).
   - Step 6: Under the "Management events" section, enable logging for IAM events.
   - Step 7: Click on "Create".
   - Step 8: Once the trail is created, go to the IAM service.
   - Step 9: Click on "Policies" in the left navigation pane.
   - Step 10: Create a new IAM policy that allows the necessary CloudTrail actions and attach it to the IAM users or groups that require access to CloudTrail logs.

#### Using CLI

1. Ensure IAM users have strong passwords:
- Use the `update-login-profile` command to enforce a strong password policy for IAM users:
  ```
  aws iam update-login-profile --user-name <user-name> --password <new-password> --password-reset-required
  ```

2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users:
- Use the `enable-mfa-device` command to enable MFA for an IAM user:
  ```
  aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <user-name> --serial-number <mfa-serial-number> --authentication-code1 <code1> --authentication-code2 <code2>
  ```

3. Rotate access keys regularly:
- Use the `create-access-key` command to generate a new access key for an IAM user:
  ```
  aws iam create-access-key --user-name <user-name>
  ```
- Use the `delete-access-key` command to delete the old access key:
  ```
  aws iam delete-access-key --user-name <user-name> --access-key-id <access-key-id>
  ```

#### Using Python

1. Ensure IAM users have strong passwords:
   - Use the `boto3` library in Python to retrieve a list of IAM users.
   - For each user, check if their password is strong by validating it against a set of password complexity rules.
   - If a user's password is weak, use the `update_login_profile` method to force a password reset for that user.

```python
import boto3
import re

def check_password_complexity(password):
    # Implement your password complexity rules here
    # Example: Password must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit
    if len(password) < 8 or not re.search(r'[A-Z]', password) or not re.search(r'[a-z]', password) or not re.search(r'\d', password):
        return False
    return True

def remediate_weak_passwords():
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
    users = iam_client.list_users()['Users']
    
    for user in users:
        login_profile = iam_client.get_login_profile(UserName=user['UserName'])
        if 'LoginProfile' in login_profile:
            password = login_profile['LoginProfile'].get('Password')
            if password and not check_password_complexity(password):
                iam_client.update_login_profile(UserName=user['UserName'], PasswordResetRequired=True)
```

2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users:
   - Use the `boto3` library in Python to retrieve a list of IAM users.
   - For each user, check if MFA is enabled by calling the `list_mfa_devices` method.
   - If MFA is not enabled, use the `enable_mfa` method to enable it for the user.

```python
import boto3

def remediate_missing_mfa():
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
    users = iam_client.list_users()['Users']
    
    for user in users:
        mfa_devices = iam_client.list_mfa_devices(UserName=user['UserName'])['MFADevices']
        if not mfa_devices:
            iam_client.enable_mfa(UserName=user['UserName'])
```

3. Remove unused IAM access keys:
   - Use the `boto3` library in Python to retrieve a list of IAM users.
   - For each user, check if they have any access keys by calling the `list_access_keys` method.
   - If the user has unused access keys, use the `delete_access_key` method to remove them.

```python
import boto3

def remediate_unused_access_keys():
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
    users = iam_client.list_users()['Users']
    
    for user in users:
        access_keys = iam_client.list_access_keys(UserName=user['UserName'])['AccessKeyMetadata']
        for access_key in access_keys:
            if access_key['Status'] == 'Inactive':
                iam_client.delete_access_key(UserName=user['UserName'], AccessKeyId=access_key['AccessKeyId'])
```
