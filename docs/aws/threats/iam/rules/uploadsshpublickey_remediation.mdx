### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The UploadSSHPublicKey event in awsrealtime for IAM refers to the action of uploading an SSH public key to an IAM user.
- This event is triggered when a user adds or updates an SSH public key in their IAM user settings.
- It allows users to securely authenticate themselves to AWS resources using SSH key pairs instead of traditional username/password authentication.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS Management Console or API credentials of an IAM user, they can potentially use the UploadSSHPublicKey event to upload their own SSH public key to the IAM user's account. This would allow them to authenticate and gain unauthorized access to the instances associated with that IAM user.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and rotate IAM user credentials to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security.
- Monitor and analyze CloudTrail logs for any suspicious activity related to the UploadSSHPublicKey event.
- Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict the ability to upload SSH public keys to trusted administrators only.

Example CLI command to disable SSH public key uploads for IAM users:
```
aws iam update-account-configuration --ssh-public-key-upload-enabled false
```

2. Example of security impact: If an attacker gains access to an IAM user's credentials and uploads a malicious SSH public key, they can potentially gain unauthorized access to the instances associated with that IAM user. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or even complete compromise of the affected instances.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and rotate IAM user credentials to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
- Implement strong password policies and enforce password complexity requirements for IAM users.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API activity, including the UploadSSHPublicKey event.
- Implement network security measures such as security groups and network ACLs to restrict access to instances.
- Regularly audit and review SSH key pairs associated with IAM users to identify and remove any unauthorized keys.

Example CLI command to list SSH public keys for an IAM user:
```
aws iam list-ssh-public-keys --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME>
```

3. Example of security impact: If an attacker gains access to an IAM user's credentials and uploads their own SSH public key, they can potentially gain unauthorized access to the instances associated with that IAM user. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data loss, or even complete compromise of the affected instances.

Remediation:
- Implement strong password policies and enforce password complexity requirements for IAM users.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API activity, including the UploadSSHPublicKey event.
- Regularly review and rotate IAM user credentials to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
- Implement network security measures such as security groups and network ACLs to restrict access to instances.
- Regularly audit and review SSH key pairs associated with IAM users to identify and remove any unauthorized keys.

Example CLI command to delete an SSH public key for an IAM user:
```
aws iam delete-ssh-public-key --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME> --ssh-public-key-id <SSH_PUBLIC_KEY_ID>
```
