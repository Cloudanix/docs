### Event Information

- The DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of deleting the account-level password policy for an IAM user or role.
- This event signifies that the password policy, which defines the requirements and constraints for user passwords within an AWS account, has been removed.
- Deleting the account password policy allows users and roles to set passwords without any specific requirements or constraints, potentially compromising the security of the account.


### Examples

1. Weakening of password complexity: If the DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy action is performed in AWS IAM, it can impact security by removing the password policy requirements. This means that users will no longer be required to create strong passwords with a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This can make it easier for attackers to guess or brute-force passwords, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to user accounts.

2. Increased risk of password reuse: Without a password policy in place, users may be more likely to reuse passwords across multiple accounts or services. This can be a significant security risk, as a compromised password in one account can lead to unauthorized access to other accounts. By removing the DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy action, organizations can ensure that users are required to create unique and strong passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.

3. Lack of password expiration: A password policy typically includes a requirement for password expiration, forcing users to change their passwords periodically. If the DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy action is used, this requirement can be removed, allowing users to keep the same password indefinitely. This can increase the risk of unauthorized access, as passwords may become compromised over time without regular updates. By maintaining a password policy, organizations can enforce regular password changes and reduce the risk of password-based attacks.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the weakening of password complexity, lack of password expiration, and absence of password reuse prevention in AWS IAM using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console.
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Account settings."
3. On the "Account settings" page, locate the "Password policy" section.
4. Click on the "Edit" button next to "Password policy."
5. Configure the password policy settings according to your desired level of complexity, expiration, and reuse prevention. For example, you can set a minimum password length, require specific character types, and enable password expiration.
6. Click on the "Apply password policy" button to save the changes.

By following these steps, you can remediate the weakening of password complexity by enforcing a strong password policy, address the lack of password expiration by setting a password expiration period, and prevent password reuse by disallowing the use of previous passwords.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate weakening of password complexity in AWS IAM, you can use the `PutAccountPasswordPolicy` action to set a strong password policy. This can be done using the AWS CLI with the following command:

```
aws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 8 --require-symbols --require-numbers --require-uppercase-characters --require-lowercase-characters --allow-users-to-change-password
```

2. To remediate the lack of password expiration in AWS IAM, you can use the `PutAccountPasswordPolicy` action to enforce password expiration. This can be done using the AWS CLI with the following command:

```
aws iam update-account-password-policy --expire-passwords --max-password-age 90
```

This command sets the maximum password age to 90 days, but you can adjust the value as per your organization's requirements.

3. To remediate the absence of password reuse prevention in AWS IAM, you can use the `PutAccountPasswordPolicy` action to enable password reuse prevention. This can be done using the AWS CLI with the following command:

```
aws iam update-account-password-policy --password-reuse-prevention 5
```

This command sets the number of previous passwords that cannot be reused to 5, but you can adjust the value as per your organization's requirements.

#### Using Python

To remediate the weakening of password complexity, lack of password expiration, and absence of password reuse prevention in AWS IAM using Python scripts, you can utilize the AWS SDK (Boto3) to create and enforce a strong password policy. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Install the Boto3 library: `pip install boto3`

2. Import the necessary modules in your Python script:
```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
```

3. Create a function to update the account-level password policy:
```python
def update_password_policy():
    try:
        # Create a Boto3 IAM client
        iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

        # Define the desired password policy parameters
        password_policy = {
            'MinimumPasswordLength': 12,
            'RequireSymbols': True,
            'RequireNumbers': True,
            'RequireUppercaseCharacters': True,
            'RequireLowercaseCharacters': True,
            'MaxPasswordAge': 90,
            'PasswordReusePrevention': 5
        }

        # Update the password policy
        iam_client.update_account_password_policy(**password_policy)
        print("Account-level password policy updated successfully.")
    except ClientError as e:
        print("Error updating password policy:", e)
```

4. Call the function to update the password policy:
```python
update_password_policy()
```

By executing the above Python script, you will be able to remediate the weakening of password complexity, lack of password expiration, and absence of password reuse prevention in AWS IAM by enforcing a strong password policy.
