### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeletePolicy event in AWS IAM refers to the action of deleting an IAM policy.
- When this event occurs, it indicates that a specific IAM policy has been removed from the AWS account.
- This event is useful for tracking changes and maintaining an audit trail of policy deletions in the IAM environment.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeletePolicy event in AWS IAM:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to an IAM user or role with sufficient permissions, they can potentially delete IAM policies. This can lead to the removal of important security controls and allow the attacker to escalate their privileges or perform unauthorized actions within the AWS account.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeletePolicy event in AWS IAM:
   - Regularly review and audit IAM policies to ensure they are up to date and aligned with the principle of least privilege.
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture all API activities, including policy deletions, and configure alerts or notifications to be triggered when such events occur. This will help in detecting and responding to unauthorized policy deletions in a timely manner.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users and roles to add an extra layer of security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

3. Bash script example to detect and respond to unauthorized policy deletions using AWS CLI:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Set the AWS region and profile
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
   export AWS_PROFILE=my-profile

   # Specify the policy ARN to monitor
   POLICY_ARN="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MyPolicy"

   # Get the latest CloudTrail events
   EVENTS=$(aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=DeletePolicy)

   # Check if any events match the specified policy ARN
   if echo "$EVENTS" | grep -q "$POLICY_ARN"; then
       # Unauthorized policy deletion detected, take appropriate actions (e.g., send notifications, revoke access, etc.)
       echo "Unauthorized policy deletion detected for policy: $POLICY_ARN"
       # Add your remediation steps here
   else
       echo "No unauthorized policy deletions detected"
   fi
   ```
   Note: Replace `us-west-2` with the appropriate AWS region and `my-profile` with the desired AWS CLI profile. Adjust the `POLICY_ARN` variable to match the policy you want to monitor.
