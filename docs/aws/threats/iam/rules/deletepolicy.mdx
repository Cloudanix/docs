### Event Information

- The DeletePolicy event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of deleting an IAM policy.
- When this event occurs, it means that a specific IAM policy has been removed from the AWS account.
- This event is important for auditing and tracking purposes, as it helps to monitor changes made to IAM policies and ensure compliance with security and access control requirements.


### Examples

1. Accidental deletion of IAM policies: If the DeletePolicy permission is granted to an IAM user or role without proper restrictions, it can lead to accidental deletion of IAM policies. This can result in the loss of access control configurations and potentially compromise the security of the AWS resources.

2. Unauthorized removal of access controls: If an attacker gains access to an IAM user or role with the DeletePolicy permission, they can maliciously remove access controls by deleting IAM policies. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources and data within the AWS environment.

3. Impact on compliance and audit requirements: Deleting IAM policies without proper documentation and justification can impact compliance and audit requirements. It becomes difficult to track and monitor access controls, which can result in non-compliance with regulatory standards such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, or GDPR. It is important to have strict controls and monitoring in place to prevent unauthorized deletion of IAM policies.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Accidental deletion of IAM policies:
   - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
   - Step 3: Select "Policies" from the left-hand menu.
   - Step 4: Identify the policy that was accidentally deleted.
   - Step 5: Click on the "Create Policy" button.
   - Step 6: Recreate the policy by providing the necessary details and permissions.
   - Step 7: Review the policy and click on the "Create Policy" button to save it.
   - Step 8: Attach the newly created policy to the appropriate IAM users or roles.

2. Unauthorized policy deletion:
   - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
   - Step 3: Select "Policies" from the left-hand menu.
   - Step 4: Identify the policy that was maliciously deleted.
   - Step 5: Click on the "Policy Actions" dropdown menu and select "View Policy Versions".
   - Step 6: Identify the deleted policy version and click on the "Restore" button next to it.
   - Step 7: Review the restored policy and click on the "Restore" button to save it.
   - Step 8: Monitor and investigate any unauthorized access or changes made during the incident.

3. Impact on resource permissions:
   - Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
   - Step 3: Select "Policies" from the left-hand menu.
   - Step 4: Identify the policy that was deleted or modified.
   - Step 5: Click on the policy to view its details.
   - Step 6: Assess the impact of the deleted or modified policy on resource permissions.
   - Step 7: If necessary, create a new policy or modify an existing policy to restore the required permissions.
   - Step 8: Attach the updated policy to the appropriate IAM users or roles and verify the resource access.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate accidental deletion of IAM policies in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, you can:
   - Implement the principle of least privilege by ensuring that the DeletePolicy permission is only granted to trusted IAM users or roles.
   - Regularly review and audit IAM policies to identify any unintended or unnecessary permissions.
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity and monitor for any suspicious or unauthorized deletion of IAM policies.

2. To remediate unauthorized policy deletion in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, you can:
   - Implement strong access controls and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users and roles.
   - Regularly review and monitor IAM policies for any unauthorized changes.
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity and set up alerts or notifications for any policy deletion events.

3. To mitigate the impact on resource permissions due to IAM policy deletion in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, you can:
   - Regularly backup IAM policies and maintain version control to restore them if needed.
   - Implement a change management process to ensure that any policy deletion is properly planned, reviewed, and tested before execution.
   - Monitor resource access and permissions after policy deletion to identify any issues and promptly address them.

#### Using Python

To remediate accidental deletion of IAM policies, unauthorized policy deletion, and the impact on resource permissions in AWS IAM, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement IAM policy versioning: Enable IAM policy versioning to create a backup of policies before making any changes. This allows you to easily revert to a previous version in case of accidental deletion or unauthorized changes.

```python
import boto3

# Create a new version of the policy
def create_policy_version(policy_arn, policy_document):
    client = boto3.client('iam')
    response = client.create_policy_version(
        PolicyArn=policy_arn,
        PolicyDocument=policy_document,
        SetAsDefault=True
    )
    return response['PolicyVersion']['VersionId']

# Example usage
policy_arn = 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MyPolicy'
policy_document = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
        }
    ]
}
version_id = create_policy_version(policy_arn, policy_document)
```

2. Implement IAM policy permissions boundaries: Set up IAM policy permissions boundaries to restrict the actions that can be performed on IAM policies. This helps prevent unauthorized deletion or modification of policies by limiting the permissions of IAM users or roles.

```python
import boto3

# Attach a permissions boundary to an IAM policy
def attach_permissions_boundary(policy_arn, permissions_boundary_arn):
    client = boto3.client('iam')
    response = client.put_policy_version(
        PolicyArn=policy_arn,
        PermissionsBoundary=permissions_boundary_arn
    )
    return response

# Example usage
policy_arn = 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MyPolicy'
permissions_boundary_arn = 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MyPermissionsBoundary'
attach_permissions_boundary(policy_arn, permissions_boundary_arn)
```

3. Enable AWS CloudTrail logging: Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API actions related to IAM policies. This allows you to track any changes made to policies, including deletions, and helps in identifying unauthorized activities.

```python
import boto3

# Enable CloudTrail logging for IAM
def enable_cloudtrail_logging():
    client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
    response = client.start_logging(
        Name='MyCloudTrail',
        S3BucketName='my-cloudtrail-bucket'
    )
    return response

# Example usage
enable_cloudtrail_logging()
```

By implementing these measures, you can mitigate the risks associated with accidental deletion and unauthorized modification of IAM policies, ensuring the security and integrity of your AWS resources.
