### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteLoginProfile event in AWS IAM refers to the action of deleting a user's login profile within the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.
- When this event occurs, it indicates that the login profile associated with a specific IAM user has been removed, preventing the user from accessing the AWS Management Console using their password.
- This event is typically triggered when an administrator or the user themselves initiates the deletion of the login profile, either through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or API calls.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteLoginProfile event in AWS IAM:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to an IAM user's credentials and deletes the login profile, they can effectively disable the user's ability to log in and access resources. This can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteLoginProfile event:
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security. This ensures that even if the login profile is deleted, an attacker would still need the MFA device to gain access.
   - Regularly monitor IAM events and set up CloudWatch Event Rules to trigger notifications or automated actions when a DeleteLoginProfile event occurs. This can help in detecting and responding to unauthorized activities promptly.

3. AWS CLI command to enable MFA for an IAM user:
   ```
   aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <IAM-USER-NAME> --serial-number <MFA-DEVICE-ARN> --authentication-code1 <CODE1> --authentication-code2 <CODE2>
   ```
   Note: Replace `<IAM-USER-NAME>` with the actual IAM user name, `<MFA-DEVICE-ARN>` with the ARN of the MFA device, and `<CODE1>` and `<CODE2>` with the authentication codes provided by the MFA device.

   AWS CLI command to create a CloudWatch Event Rule for monitoring DeleteLoginProfile events:
   ```
   aws events put-rule --name "MonitorDeleteLoginProfile" --event-pattern "{\"source\":[\"aws.iam\"],\"detail-type\":[\"AWS API Call via CloudTrail\"],\"detail\":{\"eventSource\":[\"iam.amazonaws.com\"],\"eventName\":[\"DeleteLoginProfile\"]}}"
   ```
   Note: This command creates a CloudWatch Event Rule named "MonitorDeleteLoginProfile" that triggers for DeleteLoginProfile events in IAM. You can customize the rule name as per your preference.
