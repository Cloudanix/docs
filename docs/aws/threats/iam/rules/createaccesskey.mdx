### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The CreateAccessKey event in AWS IAM refers to the action of creating an access key for an IAM user.
- This event is triggered when a new access key is generated for an IAM user, which is used for programmatic access to AWS services.
- The CreateAccessKey event is useful for monitoring and auditing purposes, as it allows tracking of access key creation activities within an AWS account.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with CreateAccessKey event in AWS IAM:
   - An unauthorized user gains access to an IAM user's credentials and creates a new access key using the CreateAccessKey API.
   - The unauthorized user can then use the newly created access key to perform actions on behalf of the compromised IAM user, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or malicious activities.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by CreateAccessKey event:
   - Regularly monitor IAM events and set up alerts for CreateAccessKey events to detect any unauthorized access or key creation.
   - Implement strong IAM security practices, such as enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users, regularly rotating access keys, and using IAM roles instead of IAM users where possible.
   - Disable access keys for IAM users that are not actively used or required, reducing the attack surface.
   - Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely store and manage access keys, reducing the risk of exposure.

3. AWS CLI command to disable an access key for an IAM user:
   ```
   aws iam update-access-key --access-key-id <access-key-id> --status Inactive --user-name <user-name>
   ```
   This command sets the status of the specified access key to "Inactive" for the given IAM user, effectively disabling it.
