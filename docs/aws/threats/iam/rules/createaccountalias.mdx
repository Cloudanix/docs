### Event Information

- The CreateAccountAlias event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of creating an alias for an AWS account.
- An account alias is a custom name that can be assigned to an AWS account to make it easier to identify and manage multiple accounts.
- This event indicates that an account alias has been successfully created, allowing users to refer to the AWS account using the alias instead of the account ID.


### Examples

1. Increased risk of unauthorized access: By using the CreateAccountAlias API in AWS IAM, security can be impacted if the account alias is set to a predictable or easily guessable value. This can increase the risk of unauthorized access as attackers may be able to guess the alias and use it in their attempts to gain access to the account.

2. Weakened password policies: Another potential security impact of using CreateAccountAlias is the possibility of weakening password policies. If the account alias is set to a value that is easily guessable or commonly used, users may be more likely to choose weak passwords that can be easily compromised. This can significantly increase the risk of unauthorized access to the account.

3. Difficulty in tracking and auditing: Setting a custom account alias using CreateAccountAlias can make it more difficult to track and audit account activities. If multiple accounts within an organization have different aliases, it can be challenging to correlate and analyze logs and events across these accounts. This can hinder incident response and forensic investigations, potentially impacting the overall security posture of the organization.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Increased risk of unauthorized access:
- Access the AWS Management Console.
- Go to the IAM service.
- In the left navigation pane, click on "Account settings".
- Under the "Account alias" section, click on "Edit".
- Enter a unique and non-predictable value for the account alias.
- Click on "Save changes" to apply the new account alias.

2. Weakened password policies:
- Access the AWS Management Console.
- Go to the IAM service.
- In the left navigation pane, click on "Account settings".
- Under the "Password policy" section, click on "Edit".
- Set strong password requirements such as minimum length, complexity, and expiration.
- Ensure that the account alias is not easily included in a password.
- Click on "Save changes" to apply the new password policy.

3. Difficulty in auditing and monitoring:
- Access the AWS Management Console.
- Go to the IAM service.
- In the left navigation pane, click on "Account settings".
- Under the "Account alias" section, ensure that each AWS account has a unique alias.
- Implement centralized logging and monitoring solutions, such as AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch, to capture and analyze account activity.
- Configure appropriate filters and alerts to track and attribute actions to specific accounts.
- Regularly review and analyze the logs and alerts to identify any suspicious or unauthorized activities.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate the increased risk of unauthorized access, you can use the AWS CLI to update the account alias to a more secure value. The following command can be used:

   ```
   aws iam create-account-alias --account-alias <new-alias>
   ```

   Replace `<new-alias>` with a unique and unpredictable value that is not easily guessable.

2. To address weakened password policies, you should enforce strong password policies in AWS IAM. This can be done using the AWS CLI with the following command:

   ```
   aws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length <length> --require-symbols --require-numbers --require-uppercase-characters --require-lowercase-characters
   ```

   Replace `<length>` with the desired minimum password length. This command enforces the use of symbols, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase characters in passwords.

3. To mitigate the difficulty in auditing and monitoring, it is recommended to enable AWS CloudTrail for logging and monitoring account activity. This can be done using the AWS CLI with the following command:

   ```
   aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <trail-name> --s3-bucket-name <bucket-name> --is-multi-region-trail
   ```

   Replace `<trail-name>` with a unique name for the CloudTrail trail and `<bucket-name>` with the name of the S3 bucket where the logs will be stored. Enabling multi-region trail ensures that logs are captured from all regions.

#### Using Python

1. Increased risk of unauthorized access:
- Use the `boto3` library in Python to interact with the AWS IAM service.
- Retrieve the current account alias using the `list_account_aliases()` method.
- Check if the current alias is set to a predictable or easily guessable value.
- If the alias is found to be weak, generate a random and secure alias using the `random` module in Python.
- Update the account alias using the `create_account_alias()` method, passing the new alias as a parameter.

```python
import boto3
import random
import string

# Create a session using your AWS credentials
session = boto3.Session(aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
                        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
                        region_name='us-west-2')

# Create an IAM client
iam_client = session.client('iam')

# Retrieve the current account alias
response = iam_client.list_account_aliases()
current_alias = response['AccountAliases'][0]

# Check if the current alias is weak
if current_alias == 'predictable_alias':
    # Generate a random and secure alias
    new_alias = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits, k=10))
    
    # Update the account alias
    iam_client.create_account_alias(AccountAlias=new_alias)
```

2. Weakened password policies:
- Use the `boto3` library in Python to interact with the AWS IAM service.
- Retrieve the current password policy using the `get_account_password_policy()` method.
- Check if the password policy allows weak passwords (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements).
- If the policy is found to be weak, update the password policy using the `update_account_password_policy()` method, setting stronger requirements.

```python
import boto3

# Create a session using your AWS credentials
session = boto3.Session(aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
                        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
                        region_name='us-west-2')

# Create an IAM client
iam_client = session.client('iam')

# Retrieve the current password policy
response = iam_client.get_account_password_policy()
current_policy = response['PasswordPolicy']

# Check if the password policy allows weak passwords
if current_policy['MinimumPasswordLength'] < 12:
    # Update the password policy with stronger requirements
    new_policy = {
        'MinimumPasswordLength': 12,
        'RequireSymbols': True,
        'RequireNumbers': True,
        'RequireUppercaseCharacters': True,
        'RequireLowercaseCharacters': True,
        'AllowUsersToChangePassword': True
    }
    
    # Update the password policy
    iam_client.update_account_password_policy(**new_policy)
}
```

3. Difficulty in auditing and monitoring:
- Use the `boto3` library in Python to interact with the AWS IAM service.
- Retrieve the list of AWS accounts using the `list_accounts()` method.
- Check if any accounts have the same account alias.
- If multiple accounts share the same alias, consider updating the aliases to unique values using the `create_account_alias()` method.

```python
import boto3

# Create a session using your AWS credentials
session = boto3.Session(aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
                        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
                        region_name='us-west-2')

# Create an Organizations client
org_client = session.client('organizations')

# Retrieve the list of AWS accounts
response = org_client.list_accounts()
accounts = response['Accounts']

# Check if any accounts have the same account alias
alias_counts = {}
for account in accounts:
    if account['Status'] == 'ACTIVE':
        if account['JoinedMethod'] == 'CREATED':
            alias = account['Name']
        else:
            alias = account['JoinedMethodMetadata']['AccountAlias']
        
        if alias in alias_counts:
            alias_counts[alias] += 1
        else:
            alias_counts[alias] = 1

# Update the aliases to unique values if necessary
for alias, count in alias_counts.items():
    if count > 1:
        new_alias = f'{alias}-{count}'
        iam_client.create_account_alias(AccountAlias=new_alias)
}
```
