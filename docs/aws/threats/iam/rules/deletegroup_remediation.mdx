### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteGroup event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of deleting an IAM group.
- When this event occurs, it means that a specific IAM group has been removed from the AWS account.
- This event can be useful for auditing and tracking purposes, as it provides visibility into the deletion of IAM groups and helps in maintaining a secure and well-managed IAM environment.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with DeleteGroup in AWS IAM, an example would be if a user with malicious intent gains access to the AWS console and deletes a group that has important permissions attached to it. This could result in unauthorized access to resources or disruption of services.

- Remediation steps using AWS console:
  1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
  2. Open the IAM console.
  3. In the navigation pane, choose "Groups".
  4. Select the deleted group from the list of groups.
  5. Choose "Attach Policy" to reattach the necessary policies to the group.
  6. Review the policies attached to the group and ensure they are appropriate and necessary.
  7. Choose "Save Changes" to apply the changes and restore the necessary permissions to the group.
  8. Monitor the group and its permissions regularly to prevent any unauthorized changes in the future.

Note: It is important to regularly review and audit IAM permissions to ensure that only necessary permissions are granted and to detect any unauthorized changes. Additionally, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users can add an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access to the AWS console.

#### Using CLI

- Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS CLI or API credentials of an IAM user with the necessary permissions, they can use the `aws iam delete-group` command to delete an IAM group. This can result in the loss of group membership and associated permissions for all users within that group, potentially leading to unauthorized access or disruption of services.

- Remediation for AWS IAM using AWS CLI:
  1. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users: By enabling MFA, you add an extra layer of security to the IAM user's credentials, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access and perform actions like deleting IAM groups. Use the `aws iam enable-mfa-device` command to enable MFA for a specific IAM user.
  2. Implement strong IAM policies: Ensure that IAM policies are properly configured to restrict access to the `delete-group` action. Use the `aws iam put-group-policy` command to attach a policy to the IAM group that limits the `delete-group` action to only authorized users or roles.
  3. Regularly review IAM permissions: Periodically review and audit the IAM permissions assigned to users and groups. Remove unnecessary permissions and ensure that the principle of least privilege is followed. Use the `aws iam list-attached-group-policies` command to list the policies attached to a specific IAM group and `aws iam detach-group-policy` to remove any unnecessary policies.

Example CLI commands:
- Enable MFA for an IAM user:
```
aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME> --serial-number <MFA_DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER> --authentication-code1 <CODE1> --authentication-code2 <CODE2>
```

- Attach a policy to restrict `delete-group` action:
```
aws iam put-group-policy --group-name <GROUP_NAME> --policy-name <POLICY_NAME> --policy-document file://policy.json
```

- List attached policies for an IAM group:
```
aws iam list-attached-group-policies --group-name <GROUP_NAME>
```

- Detach a policy from an IAM group:
```
aws iam detach-group-policy --group-name <GROUP_NAME> --policy-arn <POLICY_ARN>
```
