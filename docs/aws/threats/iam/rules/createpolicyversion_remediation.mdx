### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example of security impact: If the CreatePolicyVersion action is granted to an IAM user or role without proper restrictions, it can potentially lead to unauthorized changes to IAM policies. This can result in privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain excessive permissions or modify policies to bypass security controls.

- Remediation steps using AWS console:
  1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console.
  2. Navigate to the "Policies" section in the left-hand menu.
  3. Identify the policy that grants the CreatePolicyVersion action and click on its name to open the policy details.
  4. Review the policy document to ensure that the action is only granted to trusted users or roles.
  5. If necessary, modify the policy document to restrict the CreatePolicyVersion action to specific users or roles.
  6. Save the changes to the policy document.
  7. Regularly review and audit the policies to ensure that the CreatePolicyVersion action is not granted unnecessarily and that the permissions are aligned with the principle of least privilege.

#### Using CLI

- One example of how security can be impacted with CreatePolicyVersion in AWS IAM is if an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS CLI or API credentials and uses the CreatePolicyVersion command to create a new version of an existing IAM policy without proper authorization.

To remediate this issue for AWS IAM using AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Rotate Access Keys: If unauthorized access has been detected, it is recommended to rotate the access keys associated with the compromised IAM user or role. This can be done using the following AWS CLI command:

   ```
   aws iam create-access-key --user-name <IAM-USER-NAME>
   ```

   This command will create a new access key for the specified IAM user. Make sure to update the access key in any applications or scripts that use it.

2. Review IAM Policies: Review the IAM policies associated with the compromised user or role to ensure that only the necessary permissions are granted. Remove any unnecessary or overly permissive policies. You can use the following AWS CLI command to list the policies attached to an IAM user or role:

   ```
   aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name <IAM-USER-NAME>
   ```

   ```
   aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name <IAM-ROLE-NAME>
   ```

   Review the output and identify any policies that need to be removed or modified.

3. Enable MFA: Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the IAM user or role to add an extra layer of security. This can be done using the following AWS CLI command:

   ```
   aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <IAM-USER-NAME> --serial-number <MFA-DEVICE-SERIAL-NUMBER> --authentication-code1 <CODE1> --authentication-code2 <CODE2>
   ```

   Replace `<IAM-USER-NAME>` with the name of the IAM user and `<MFA-DEVICE-SERIAL-NUMBER>` with the serial number of the MFA device. `<CODE1>` and `<CODE2>` are the authentication codes generated by the MFA device.

By following these steps, you can remediate the security impact of unauthorized usage of CreatePolicyVersion in AWS IAM and strengthen the overall security of your AWS environment.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with CreatePolicyVersion in AWS IAM:
   - An attacker gains unauthorized access to an IAM user's credentials and uses them to create a new policy version with escalated privileges.
   - The attacker then attaches the new policy version to an IAM role or user, granting themselves additional permissions.

2. Remediation for AWS IAM using Python:
   - Implement strong security measures to protect IAM user credentials, such as enforcing strong password policies, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), and regularly rotating access keys.
   - Regularly monitor IAM activity logs and set up alerts for any suspicious activities, such as unexpected policy version creations.
   - Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to automate the detection and remediation of unauthorized policy version creations. Here's an example Python script:

```python
import boto3

def detect_unauthorized_policy_versions():
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
    response = iam_client.list_policies()
    
    for policy in response['Policies']:
        policy_versions = iam_client.list_policy_versions(PolicyArn=policy['Arn'])
        
        for version in policy_versions['Versions']:
            if version['IsDefaultVersion'] is False and version['CreateDate'] < threshold_date:
                print(f"Unauthorized policy version detected: {version['PolicyArn']}")

def delete_unauthorized_policy_versions():
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
    response = iam_client.list_policies()
    
    for policy in response['Policies']:
        policy_versions = iam_client.list_policy_versions(PolicyArn=policy['Arn'])
        
        for version in policy_versions['Versions']:
            if version['IsDefaultVersion'] is False and version['CreateDate'] < threshold_date:
                iam_client.delete_policy_version(PolicyArn=policy['Arn'], VersionId=version['VersionId'])
                print(f"Unauthorized policy version deleted: {version['PolicyArn']}")

# Set the threshold date for unauthorized policy versions
threshold_date = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=30)

# Detect and print unauthorized policy versions
detect_unauthorized_policy_versions()

# Delete unauthorized policy versions
delete_unauthorized_policy_versions()
```

Note: The above script detects and deletes unauthorized policy versions that were created more than 30 days ago. Adjust the threshold date as per your requirements.
