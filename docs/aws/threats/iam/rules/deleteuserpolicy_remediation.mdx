### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteUserPolicy event in AWS IAM refers to the action of deleting a policy attached to a user.
- This event is triggered when a user policy is removed from an IAM user.
- It is important to monitor this event as it can help track changes in user permissions and ensure that policies are being managed properly.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteUserPolicy event in AWS IAM:
- An attacker gains unauthorized access to an IAM user's credentials and uses them to delete a user policy.
- This can result in the removal of important security policies that restrict the user's permissions, allowing the attacker to escalate privileges and perform unauthorized actions.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteUserPolicy event in AWS IAM:
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access.
- Regularly review and audit IAM policies to ensure they are up to date and aligned with the principle of least privilege.
- Implement AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API activities, including IAM policy changes, to detect and investigate any suspicious or unauthorized actions.

3. AWS CLI command to enable MFA for an IAM user:
```
aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME> --serial-number <MFA_DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER> --authentication-code1 <CODE1> --authentication-code2 <CODE2>
```

Note: Replace `<IAM_USER_NAME>` with the actual IAM user name, `<MFA_DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER>` with the serial number of the MFA device, and `<CODE1>` and `<CODE2>` with the authentication codes provided by the MFA device.

AWS CLI command to enable CloudTrail for logging IAM events:
```
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <TRAIL_NAME> --s3-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME> --is-multi-region-trail --include-global-service-events
```

Note: Replace `<TRAIL_NAME>` with the desired name for the CloudTrail trail and `<BUCKET_NAME>` with the name of the S3 bucket where the logs will be stored.
