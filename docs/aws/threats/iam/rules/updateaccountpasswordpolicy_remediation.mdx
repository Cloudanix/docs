### Event Information

- The UpdateAccountPasswordPolicy event in AWS for IAM refers to a change made to the account-level password policy settings.
- This event is triggered when the password policy for the AWS account is updated, such as changing the minimum password length, requiring specific character types, or setting password expiration rules.
- It is important to monitor this event to ensure that the account password policy aligns with security best practices and compliance requirements.


### Examples

1. Complexity requirements: By updating the account password policy in AWS IAM, you can enforce complexity requirements for user passwords. For example, you can set a minimum password length, require the use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This helps to ensure that user passwords are strong and less susceptible to brute-force attacks.

2. Password expiration: Another security impact of updating the account password policy is the ability to set password expiration. By configuring a password expiration period, you can enforce regular password changes, reducing the risk of compromised credentials being used over an extended period of time.

3. Prevent password reuse: Updating the account password policy also allows you to prevent users from reusing their previous passwords. This ensures that users are forced to choose new and unique passwords each time they change their password, further enhancing the security of their accounts.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate weak password requirements, lack of password rotation, and inadequate password complexity in AWS IAM using the AWS console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.

2. In the left navigation pane, click on "Account settings."

3. Under the "Password policy" section, click on "Edit."

4. Configure the following settings to strengthen password requirements:

   - Minimum password length: Set a minimum length for passwords, such as 8 characters.
   - Require uppercase letters: Enable this option to enforce the use of at least one uppercase letter.
   - Require lowercase letters: Enable this option to enforce the use of at least one lowercase letter.
   - Require numbers: Enable this option to enforce the use of at least one number.
   - Require symbols: Enable this option to enforce the use of at least one special character.
   - Allow users to change their own password: Enable this option to allow users to change their own passwords.
   - Enable password expiration: Enable this option to enforce regular password rotation. Set the maximum password age according to your organization's security policies.

5. Click on "Apply password policy" to save the changes.

By following these steps, you can remediate weak password requirements, lack of password rotation, and inadequate password complexity in AWS IAM, thereby improving the security of your AWS account.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate weak password requirements in AWS IAM using AWS CLI, you can use the `update-account-password-policy` command. Here's an example command to enforce strong password requirements:

```
aws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 8 --require-symbols --require-uppercase-characters --require-lowercase-characters --require-numbers --allow-users-to-change-password
```

2. To remediate the lack of password rotation, you can use the `update-account-password-policy` command to set a maximum password age. Here's an example command to enforce password rotation every 90 days:

```
aws iam update-account-password-policy --max-password-age 90
```

3. To remediate inadequate password complexity, you can use the `update-account-password-policy` command to enforce specific complexity requirements. Here's an example command to enforce a minimum password length of 10 characters and require at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character:

```
aws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 10 --require-symbols --require-uppercase-characters --require-lowercase-characters --require-numbers
```

#### Using Python

1. Weak password requirements: To remediate weak password requirements in AWS IAM using Python, you can use the AWS SDK (boto3) to update the account password policy. Here's an example script:

```python
import boto3

# Create IAM client
iam = boto3.client('iam')

# Update password policy
response = iam.update_account_password_policy(
    MinimumPasswordLength=12,
    RequireSymbols=True,
    RequireNumbers=True,
    RequireUppercaseCharacters=True,
    RequireLowercaseCharacters=True,
    AllowUsersToChangePassword=True,
    MaxPasswordAge=90,
    PasswordReusePrevention=5
)

print("Password policy updated successfully")
```

2. Lack of password rotation: To enforce regular password rotation in AWS IAM using Python, you can update the password policy and set the `MaxPasswordAge` parameter to the desired number of days. Here's an example script:

```python
import boto3

# Create IAM client
iam = boto3.client('iam')

# Update password policy
response = iam.update_account_password_policy(
    MaxPasswordAge=90
)

print("Password rotation policy updated successfully")
```

3. Inadequate password complexity: To enforce strong password complexity requirements in AWS IAM using Python, you can update the password policy and set parameters such as `MinimumPasswordLength`, `RequireSymbols`, `RequireNumbers`, `RequireUppercaseCharacters`, and `RequireLowercaseCharacters`. Here's an example script:

```python
import boto3

# Create IAM client
iam = boto3.client('iam')

# Update password policy
response = iam.update_account_password_policy(
    MinimumPasswordLength=12,
    RequireSymbols=True,
    RequireNumbers=True,
    RequireUppercaseCharacters=True,
    RequireLowercaseCharacters=True
)

print("Password complexity policy updated successfully")
```
