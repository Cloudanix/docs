### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteGroup event in AWS IAM refers to the action of deleting an IAM group.
- When this event occurs, it indicates that a specific IAM group has been deleted from the AWS account.
- This event can be useful for monitoring and auditing purposes, allowing administrators to track changes made to IAM groups and maintain a record of group deletions.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteGroup event in AWS IAM:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and performs a DeleteGroup operation in IAM, they can potentially delete a group that has important permissions attached to it. This can lead to unauthorized access to resources or disruption of critical operations.

2. Remediation steps for mitigating the impact of DeleteGroup event:
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access to the AWS account.
   - Implement strict IAM policies and permissions to limit the ability to delete groups. Only authorized users should have the necessary permissions to perform such actions.

3. Bash script example to enforce strict IAM policies and permissions:
   ```bash
   # Create a policy that denies the DeleteGroup action
   aws iam create-policy --policy-name DenyDeleteGroup --policy-document '{
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Deny",
               "Action": "iam:DeleteGroup",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }'

   # Attach the policy to a user or group
   aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <user-name> --policy-arn <policy-arn>
   ```
   Note: Replace `<user-name>` with the actual IAM user name and `<policy-arn>` with the ARN of the created policy.
