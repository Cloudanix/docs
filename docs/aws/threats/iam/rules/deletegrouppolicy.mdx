### Event Information

- The DeleteGroupPolicy event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of deleting a policy attached to an IAM group.
- This event indicates that a specific policy has been removed from a group, which can impact the permissions and access control of the users within that group.
- It is important to monitor and track DeleteGroupPolicy events to ensure that the policy removal was intentional and to identify any unauthorized changes to IAM group policies.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of group policies: If security is impacted with DeleteGroupPolicy in AWS for IAM, one example could be an unauthorized user gaining access to the IAM console or API and deleting group policies. This could result in the removal of important security configurations and permissions, potentially granting excessive privileges to certain users or compromising the overall security posture of the AWS account.

2. Accidental deletion of critical policies: Another example could be a legitimate user accidentally deleting a critical group policy. This could happen due to human error or lack of proper training, resulting in the removal of necessary permissions for certain users or resources. This can lead to service disruptions, data breaches, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

3. Malicious deletion of policies: A third example could be a malicious insider intentionally deleting group policies to disrupt operations or gain unauthorized access. This could be part of an insider threat scenario where an employee with privileged access misuses their privileges to cause harm to the organization. By deleting group policies, they can remove security controls and potentially gain unauthorized access to resources or sensitive data.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion of group policies in AWS IAM using the AWS console, you can follow these steps:

1. Enable AWS CloudTrail: CloudTrail provides detailed logs of API activity in your AWS account, including IAM actions. By enabling CloudTrail, you can capture and monitor any unauthorized deletion of group policies. To enable CloudTrail, go to the AWS Management Console, navigate to the CloudTrail service, and follow the instructions to create a new trail.

2. Set up CloudWatch Events: CloudWatch Events allows you to monitor and respond to events in your AWS environment. You can create a CloudWatch Events rule to detect the deletion of group policies and trigger an automated response. To set up a CloudWatch Events rule, go to the AWS Management Console, navigate to the CloudWatch service, and create a new rule with the appropriate event pattern and target action.

3. Implement IAM best practices: To prevent unauthorized deletion of group policies, it is important to follow IAM best practices. This includes implementing the principle of least privilege, regularly reviewing and auditing IAM policies, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users, and providing proper training and awareness to users with IAM access. By following these best practices, you can reduce the risk of unauthorized actions and mitigate the impact of any potential policy deletions.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion of group policies:
- Monitor IAM activity logs for any suspicious or unauthorized DeleteGroupPolicy events.
- Implement least privilege principles by granting only necessary permissions to IAM users and roles.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security.

2. Accidental deletion of critical policies:
- Regularly backup IAM policies to prevent data loss in case of accidental deletion.
- Implement versioning for IAM policies to easily revert to previous versions if needed.
- Provide proper training and documentation to users to avoid accidental deletions.

3. Malicious deletion of policies:
- Implement strong access controls and regularly review and update IAM policies.
- Enable CloudTrail to capture all API activities and monitor for any suspicious or unauthorized DeleteGroupPolicy events.
- Regularly rotate access keys and credentials to minimize the risk of insider threats.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of group policies in AWS IAM using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. Enable AWS CloudTrail: CloudTrail provides detailed logs of API activity in your AWS account, including IAM actions. By enabling CloudTrail, you can capture and analyze the events related to group policy deletions.

2. Monitor CloudTrail logs: Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to retrieve and analyze the CloudTrail logs. You can filter the logs based on the event name (`DeleteGroupPolicy`) and other relevant parameters to identify unauthorized deletions.

3. Implement preventive measures: To prevent unauthorized deletions, you can implement the following measures:
   - Apply the principle of least privilege by granting only necessary permissions to users and groups.
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security.
   - Regularly review and audit IAM policies to identify any misconfigurations or excessive permissions.
   - Implement proper access controls and segregation of duties to minimize the risk of insider threats.

Here's an example Python script using Boto3 to retrieve CloudTrail logs for unauthorized group policy deletions:

```python
import boto3

def get_unauthorized_deletions():
    client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
    
    response = client.lookup_events(
        LookupAttributes=[
            {
                'AttributeKey': 'EventName',
                'AttributeValue': 'DeleteGroupPolicy'
            },
            {
                'AttributeKey': 'ReadOnly',
                'AttributeValue': 'true'
            }
        ]
    )
    
    unauthorized_deletions = []
    
    for event in response['Events']:
        unauthorized_deletions.append(event)
    
    return unauthorized_deletions

unauthorized_deletions = get_unauthorized_deletions()

for deletion in unauthorized_deletions:
    print(deletion)
```

Please note that this is a basic example and you may need to customize it based on your specific requirements and environment.
