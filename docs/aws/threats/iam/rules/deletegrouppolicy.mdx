### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteGroupPolicy event in AWS IAM refers to the action of deleting a policy attached to an IAM group.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process removes a policy from an IAM group.
- It is important to monitor this event as it can help track changes in permissions and access control within your AWS environment.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteGroupPolicy event in AWS IAM:
   - An unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and deletes a group policy that grants administrative privileges to a group of users. This can result in unauthorized access and potential misuse of sensitive resources.

2. Remediation steps for mitigating the impact of DeleteGroupPolicy event:
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security.
   - Regularly review and audit IAM policies and permissions to ensure they are up to date and aligned with the principle of least privilege.
   - Implement AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API activities, including IAM events, and set up alerts for any suspicious or unauthorized actions.

3. AWS CLI command to restore a deleted IAM group policy:
   - To restore a deleted IAM group policy, you can use the `create-policy` command with the `--policy-document` parameter to provide the policy document in JSON format. Here's an example:
     ```
     aws iam create-policy --policy-name <policy-name> --policy-document file://<path-to-policy-document.json>
     ```
   - Replace `<policy-name>` with the desired name for the policy and `<path-to-policy-document.json>` with the file path to the JSON document containing the policy configuration.
