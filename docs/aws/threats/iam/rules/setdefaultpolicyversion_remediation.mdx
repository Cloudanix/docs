### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The SetDefaultPolicyVersion event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of setting a specific policy version as the default version for a particular IAM policy.
- When this event occurs, it means that the default version of the policy has been updated, and any new IAM roles or users that are assigned this policy will automatically use the newly set default version.
- This event is useful for managing and controlling the access and permissions of IAM entities, as it allows for the easy management and deployment of policy changes across multiple roles and users.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example of security impact: If an attacker gains access to an AWS account and uses the SetDefaultPolicyVersion API call in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), they can potentially modify the default policy version for an IAM policy. This can lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or the bypassing of security controls.

- Remediation steps using AWS console:
  1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console.
  2. In the navigation pane, choose "Policies" and then select the policy for which you want to remediate the SetDefaultPolicyVersion impact.
  3. In the policy details page, choose the "Policy versions" tab.
  4. Identify the default policy version that has been modified by the attacker.
  5. Select the modified default policy version and choose "Delete version" from the "Actions" dropdown menu.
  6. Confirm the deletion of the modified default policy version.
  7. Review the remaining policy versions and ensure that the correct default policy version is set.
  8. If necessary, create a new policy version and set it as the default version.
  9. Monitor the IAM policy for any further unauthorized modifications and take appropriate actions to secure the AWS account.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with SetDefaultPolicyVersion in AWS IAM, it could potentially allow an unauthorized user to gain access to sensitive resources by manipulating the default policy version.
- Remediation: To remediate this issue for AWS IAM using AWS CLI, follow these steps:
  1. Identify the affected IAM policy that has the incorrect default policy version.
  2. Use the `aws iam get-policy` command to retrieve the policy details, specifying the policy ARN as an argument.
  3. Once you have the policy details, use the `aws iam create-policy-version` command to create a new policy version with the correct permissions. Specify the policy ARN, policy document, and set the `--set-as-default` flag to true to make it the default version.
  4. Finally, use the `aws iam delete-policy-version` command to delete the incorrect default policy version, specifying the policy ARN and version ID as arguments.

Example CLI commands:
```
aws iam get-policy --policy-arn <policy-arn>
aws iam create-policy-version --policy-arn <policy-arn> --policy-document file://policy.json --set-as-default
aws iam delete-policy-version --policy-arn <policy-arn> --version-id <version-id>
```

#### Using Python

1. Impact on security: When using the `SetDefaultPolicyVersion` API in AWS IAM, there is a potential security impact if the new default policy version is not properly reviewed and validated. This can lead to unintended access permissions or policy misconfigurations, potentially exposing sensitive resources or data.

2. Remediation using Python: To remediate this issue in AWS IAM using Python, you can follow these steps:

   a. Retrieve the current default policy version for the IAM policy using the `get_policy` API.
   
   ```python
   import boto3

   def get_default_policy_version(policy_arn):
       iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
       response = iam_client.get_policy(PolicyArn=policy_arn)
       return response['Policy']['DefaultVersionId']
   ```
   
   b. Update the default policy version to a specific version using the `set_default_policy_version` API.
   
   ```python
   import boto3

   def set_default_policy_version(policy_arn, version_id):
       iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
       iam_client.set_default_policy_version(PolicyArn=policy_arn, VersionId=version_id)
   ```
   
   c. Ensure that the new default policy version has been properly reviewed and validated before setting it as the default. Regularly review and audit IAM policies to maintain a secure and compliant environment.

Note: The above Python scripts use the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python, to interact with AWS IAM. Make sure to configure your AWS credentials before running these scripts.
