### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteAccessKey event in AWS IAM refers to the action of deleting an access key associated with an IAM user.
- This event is triggered when an administrator or the user themselves initiates the deletion of an access key.
- The DeleteAccessKey event is logged in the AWS CloudTrail service, providing an audit trail of access key management activities for compliance and security purposes.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteAccessKey event in AWS IAM:
- An attacker gains unauthorized access to an IAM user's credentials and uses them to delete an access key associated with the user.
- This can lead to a potential security breach as the compromised access key can be used to perform unauthorized actions on AWS resources.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteAccessKey event in AWS IAM:
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security. This ensures that even if an attacker gains access to the user's credentials, they would still need the MFA device to complete the authentication process.
- Regularly rotate access keys for IAM users to minimize the impact of compromised keys. You can use the AWS CLI to automate the key rotation process. Here's an example command to rotate an access key for a specific IAM user:

```
aws iam update-access-key --access-key-id <access-key-id> --user-name <user-name> --status Inactive
aws iam create-access-key --user-name <user-name>
```

3. Implement strong password policies and enforce regular password updates for IAM users. This helps prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and reduces the risk of access key compromise.
- You can configure password policies using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. Here's an example command to update the password policy:

```
aws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 12 --require-symbols --require-uppercase-characters --require-lowercase-characters --require-numbers --allow-users-to-change-password
```
