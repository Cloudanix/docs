### Event Information

- The DeleteSSHPublicKey event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of deleting an SSH public key associated with an IAM user.
- This event is triggered when an administrator or the IAM user themselves removes an SSH public key from their IAM user account.
- The DeleteSSHPublicKey event is logged in the CloudTrail service, providing an audit trail of the action for security and compliance purposes.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized access: If an attacker gains access to an IAM user's credentials and uses the DeleteSSHPublicKey API, they can remove the SSH public key associated with the user. This can potentially allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the user's resources or perform malicious actions.

2. Privilege escalation: If an IAM user with elevated privileges, such as an administrator, is compromised and their SSH public key is deleted using the DeleteSSHPublicKey API, the attacker can potentially escalate their privileges and gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources or perform administrative actions.

3. Audit trail disruption: Deleting SSH public keys using the DeleteSSHPublicKey API can impact the ability to track and monitor user activities. If an attacker deletes their SSH public key after performing malicious actions, it can make it difficult to trace their activities and identify the source of the security breach. This can hinder incident response and forensic investigations.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized access:
- Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
- Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
- Step 3: Select "Users" from the left-hand menu.
- Step 4: Search for the IAM user whose credentials have been compromised.
- Step 5: Click on the user's name to access their details.
- Step 6: In the "Security credentials" tab, locate the "SSH public keys" section.
- Step 7: Identify the SSH public key that has been deleted by the attacker.
- Step 8: Click on the "Delete" button next to the compromised SSH public key.
- Step 9: Confirm the deletion when prompted.
- Step 10: Monitor the user's activities and consider rotating their credentials to prevent further unauthorized access.

2. Privilege escalation:
- Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
- Step 2: Navigate to the IAM service.
- Step 3: Select "Users" from the left-hand menu.
- Step 4: Search for the compromised IAM user with elevated privileges.
- Step 5: Click on the user's name to access their details.
- Step 6: In the "Security credentials" tab, locate the "SSH public keys" section.
- Step 7: Identify the deleted SSH public key used for privilege escalation.
- Step 8: Click on the "Delete" button next to the compromised SSH public key.
- Step 9: Confirm the deletion when prompted.
- Step 10: Review the user's permissions and consider reducing their privileges to prevent further unauthorized access.

3. Audit trail disruption:
- Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
- Step 2: Navigate to the CloudTrail service.
- Step 3: Select the appropriate CloudTrail trail associated with the affected IAM user.
- Step 4: Click on the "Event history" tab.
- Step 5: Look for any events related to the deletion of SSH public keys.
- Step 6: Take note of the affected events and their timestamps.
- Step 7: If necessary, restore the deleted SSH public keys using backups or other means.
- Step 8: Consider enabling CloudTrail log file validation to ensure the integrity of the audit trail.
- Step 9: Regularly review CloudTrail logs for any suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.
- Step 10: Implement additional security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, to enhance the overall security of IAM users.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized access:
- Identify and revoke compromised IAM user credentials.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security.
- Regularly rotate IAM user credentials and SSH keys to minimize the impact of compromised credentials.

2. Privilege escalation:
- Monitor and analyze IAM user activity logs for any suspicious or unauthorized actions.
- Implement least privilege principles by assigning IAM users with only the necessary permissions.
- Regularly review and audit IAM user privileges to identify and remove any unnecessary elevated privileges.

3. Audit trail disruption:
- Enable CloudTrail to capture API activity logs and store them in a secure and centralized location.
- Regularly review CloudTrail logs for any unauthorized or suspicious activities.
- Implement log integrity and tamper-proofing mechanisms to ensure the integrity of audit trails.

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized access:
- Regularly rotate IAM user credentials to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. This can be done using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) by calling the `update_access_key` method to create a new access key and delete the old one.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security. This can be achieved by using the `enable_mfa_device` method in Boto3 to associate an MFA device with the IAM user.

2. Privilege escalation:
- Implement the principle of least privilege by assigning IAM users the minimum required permissions to perform their tasks. This can be done using the `update_assume_role_policy` method in Boto3 to modify the trust policy of IAM roles and restrict the users who can assume those roles.
- Regularly review and audit IAM user privileges to identify any unnecessary or excessive permissions. This can be achieved by using the `list_attached_user_policies` and `detach_user_policy` methods in Boto3 to list and detach policies from IAM users.

3. Audit trail disruption:
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity and store logs in a secure location. This can be done using the `create_trail` method in Boto3 to create a new CloudTrail trail and specify the desired settings.
- Regularly monitor and analyze CloudTrail logs to detect any suspicious or unauthorized activities. This can be achieved by using the `lookup_events` method in Boto3 to retrieve CloudTrail events and analyze them for potential security incidents.
