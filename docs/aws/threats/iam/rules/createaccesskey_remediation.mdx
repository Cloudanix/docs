### Event Information

- The CreateAccessKey event in AWS for IAM refers to the action of creating an access key for an IAM user.
- An access key is a set of credentials (access key ID and secret access key) that allows programmatic access to AWS services and resources.
- This event indicates that a new access key has been generated for an IAM user, which can be used to authenticate and authorize API requests to AWS services.


### Examples

- Unauthorized access: Creating an access key without proper authorization can lead to unauthorized individuals gaining access to sensitive resources and data within the AWS environment. This can result in data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or even complete compromise of the infrastructure.

- Lack of accountability: When access keys are created without proper documentation or tracking, it becomes difficult to attribute actions or changes to specific individuals. This can hinder incident response efforts, auditing, and compliance requirements.

- Increased attack surface: Each access key created represents a potential entry point for attackers. If access keys are not properly managed, revoked, or rotated, they can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to the AWS environment and carry out malicious activities. This can lead to data loss, service disruptions, or even financial loss.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Increased risk of unauthorized access:
- Review and audit existing access keys in the AWS IAM console.
- Delete any unused or unnecessary access keys.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security.
- Implement strong password policies and enforce regular password updates.
- Monitor and analyze access key usage and activity logs for any suspicious behavior.

2. Lack of access key rotation:
- Set up a regular access key rotation policy, such as every 90 days.
- Create a script or use AWS CLI to automate the rotation process.
- Notify IAM users in advance about the upcoming rotation and provide instructions on how to update their access keys.
- Monitor and log access key rotation activities to ensure compliance.

3. Insufficient access key management:
- Ensure that access keys are associated with specific IAM users or roles.
- Regularly review and update access permissions for IAM users and roles.
- Implement the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions to each IAM entity.
- Regularly audit and monitor access key usage and permissions to identify any anomalies or unauthorized access attempts.

#### Using CLI

1. Increased risk of unauthorized access:
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security.
- Regularly review and audit IAM policies to ensure that only necessary permissions are granted to users and roles.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API activity, including access key usage, for better visibility and detection of unauthorized access attempts.

2. Lack of access key rotation:
- Set up a schedule or automation to regularly rotate access keys for IAM users.
- Use AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely store and manage access keys.
- Implement a process to notify users and update applications or services that rely on access keys after rotation.

3. Insufficient access key management:
- Ensure that access keys are associated with specific IAM users or roles and not shared among multiple entities.
- Regularly review and remove unused or unnecessary access keys.
- Implement least privilege principles by granting only the minimum required permissions to access keys.

#### Using Python

1. Increased risk of unauthorized access:
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security.
- Regularly review and audit IAM policies to ensure that only necessary permissions are granted to users and roles.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API activity, including access key usage, for better visibility and detection of unauthorized access attempts.

2. Lack of access key rotation:
- Use AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely store and manage access keys.
- Implement a script using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to automate the rotation of access keys on a regular basis.
- Configure AWS CloudWatch Events to trigger the rotation script based on a predefined schedule or when specific events occur, such as IAM user activity or key age.

3. Insufficient access key management:
- Develop a script using Boto3 to regularly scan and identify access keys that are not properly associated with IAM users or roles.
- Implement a process to notify administrators or IAM users when access keys are not properly managed or associated.
- Utilize AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices, such as using IAM roles instead of IAM users whenever possible, to minimize the need for access keys and simplify access management.
