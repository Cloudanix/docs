### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteKeyPair event in AWS EC2 refers to the action of deleting a key pair that is used for secure login to EC2 instances.
- When this event occurs, it means that the specified key pair has been successfully deleted from the AWS account.
- This event is important for auditing and security purposes, as it helps track the removal of key pairs and ensures that unauthorized access to EC2 instances is prevented.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with a DeleteKeyPair event in AWS EC2:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and deletes a key pair associated with an EC2 instance, they can potentially gain unauthorized access to the instance.
   - This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, unauthorized modifications to the instance, or even complete compromise of the instance.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteKeyPair event in AWS EC2:
   - Regularly monitor and audit AWS account activity to detect any unauthorized access or suspicious activities.
   - Implement strong access control measures, such as using IAM roles and policies, to restrict access to key pairs and EC2 instances.
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AWS accounts to add an extra layer of security.

3. AWS CLI command to delete a key pair:
   ```
   aws ec2 delete-key-pair --key-name <key-pair-name>
   ```
   Note: Replace `<key-pair-name>` with the actual name of the key pair to be deleted.
