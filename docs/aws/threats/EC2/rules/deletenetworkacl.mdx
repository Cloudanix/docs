### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteNetworkAcl event in awsrealtime for EC2 refers to the action of deleting a network access control list (ACL) in the AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) service.
- Network ACLs act as a virtual firewall for controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level in AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) environments.
- This event indicates that a specific network ACL has been deleted, which may have implications on the network traffic and security rules within the associated VPC subnet.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteNetworkAcl event in AWS EC2:
   - If a malicious actor gains unauthorized access to the AWS account or EC2 instance, they could potentially delete a network ACL (Access Control List) associated with the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) or subnet. This could lead to a loss of network security controls and expose the resources within the VPC to unauthorized access.

2. Remediation steps for security impact caused by DeleteNetworkAcl event:
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the AWS account to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Implement strict IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies to control access to the AWS resources, including network ACLs.
   - Regularly monitor and review CloudTrail logs to detect any unauthorized activities, including the deletion of network ACLs.
   - Implement automated backups and versioning for network ACL configurations to quickly restore them in case of accidental or malicious deletion.

3. AWS CLI command to restore a deleted network ACL:
   - To restore a deleted network ACL, you can use the `create-network-acl` command with the appropriate parameters to recreate the ACL with the desired rules and associations. Here's an example:
     ```
     aws ec2 create-network-acl --vpc-id <vpc-id> --tags Key=Name,Value=<acl-name> --region <region>
     ```
     Replace `<vpc-id>` with the ID of the VPC where the network ACL was deleted, `<acl-name>` with the desired name for the network ACL, and `<region>` with the AWS region where the VPC is located.
