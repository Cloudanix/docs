### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The CreateRouteTable event in AWS EC2 refers to the creation of a new route table within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
- A route table is used to determine the path for network traffic within a VPC, allowing communication between different subnets or to external networks.
- This event indicates that a new route table has been created, and it can be further configured with routes and associations to control network traffic within the VPC.

#### Example

1. Misconfiguration of route table permissions: If the security is impacted with a CreateRouteTable event in AWS EC2, it could be due to misconfiguration of route table permissions. For example, if the route table is created with overly permissive rules, it could allow unauthorized access to resources within the VPC. 

Remediation: To remediate this issue, you can update the route table's inbound and outbound rules to only allow necessary traffic. You can use the AWS CLI to modify the route table's rules. For example, to remove a specific rule, you can use the following command:

```
aws ec2 delete-route --route-table-id <route-table-id> --destination-cidr-block <destination-cidr-block>
```

2. Unauthorized access to route table: Another possible security impact could be unauthorized access to the route table. If an attacker gains access to the AWS account and creates a malicious route table, they could redirect traffic to unauthorized destinations or intercept sensitive data.

Remediation: To mitigate this risk, it is important to regularly monitor and review the route tables in your AWS account. You can use AWS CloudTrail to track and log all API calls related to route table creation and modification. Additionally, ensure that proper access controls are in place, such as using IAM policies to restrict access to route table management.

3. Route table hijacking: In some cases, a security impact could be route table hijacking. This occurs when an attacker gains control of the route table and modifies the routing entries to redirect traffic to their own malicious resources.

Remediation: To prevent route table hijacking, it is crucial to implement strong security measures, such as enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AWS accounts, regularly rotating access keys, and regularly monitoring and reviewing route table configurations. Additionally, consider implementing network security measures, such as using network ACLs and security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.
