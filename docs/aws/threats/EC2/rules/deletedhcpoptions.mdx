### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteDhcpOptions event in AWS EC2 refers to the deletion of a DHCP options set in the EC2 environment.
- DHCP options sets in EC2 are used to configure network settings for instances, such as DNS servers, domain names, and NTP servers.
- When the DeleteDhcpOptions event occurs, it means that a specific DHCP options set has been deleted, and any instances associated with that set will no longer have the corresponding network configurations.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteDhcpOptions event in AWS EC2:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and deletes the DHCP options set, it can disrupt the network connectivity of EC2 instances.
   - This can lead to potential security risks as the instances may lose access to necessary resources or services, impacting their functionality and potentially exposing sensitive data.

2. Remediation steps for mitigating the impact of DeleteDhcpOptions event:
   - Regularly monitor and review AWS CloudTrail logs to detect any unauthorized access or modifications to DHCP options sets.
   - Implement strong access controls and follow the principle of least privilege to restrict access to DHCP options sets.
   - Enable AWS Config rules to detect and alert on any changes made to DHCP options sets, allowing for immediate response and investigation.

3. AWS CLI command to restore a deleted DHCP options set:
   - If a DHCP options set is accidentally deleted, it can be restored using the `create-dhcp-options` command in AWS CLI.
   - First, identify the VPC ID where the DHCP options set needs to be restored.
   - Then, create a new DHCP options set using the `create-dhcp-options` command and specify the desired options.
   - Finally, associate the newly created DHCP options set with the VPC using the `associate-dhcp-options` command.
