### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The google.monitoring.v3.MetricService.DeleteMetricDescriptor event in gcprealtime for Monitoring indicates that a metric descriptor has been deleted.
- This event signifies that a specific metric, which defines the characteristics and properties of a metric, has been removed from the Monitoring service in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- Deleting a metric descriptor means that any associated time series data for that metric will no longer be collected or available for analysis in GCP Monitoring.

#### Example

1. Impact on Security: The google.monitoring.v3.MetricService.DeleteMetricDescriptor event in GCP Realtime Monitoring can potentially impact security by allowing unauthorized deletion of metric descriptors. This can lead to the loss of important monitoring data and disrupt the overall monitoring and alerting capabilities of the system.

2. Example Scenario: An attacker gains unauthorized access to the GCP project and uses the `gcloud` command-line tool to delete a metric descriptor using the `metrics delete` command. For example:
```
gcloud monitoring metric-descriptors delete METRIC_DESCRIPTOR_ID
```
This action removes the specified metric descriptor, which can result in the loss of associated monitoring data and affect the accuracy of alerting and analysis.

3. Remediation: To mitigate the security impact of unauthorized metric descriptor deletion, the following steps can be taken:
- Implement strict access controls and follow the principle of least privilege to limit who can modify metric descriptors.
- Regularly review and audit the permissions and roles assigned to users and service accounts within the GCP project.
- Enable Cloud Audit Logs to capture and monitor changes made to metric descriptors, and set up alerts or notifications for any suspicious or unauthorized activities.
- Implement backup and recovery mechanisms for metric descriptors to quickly restore any accidentally deleted descriptors.
- Consider implementing version control or configuration management for metric descriptors to track changes and revert to previous versions if necessary.
