#### Example

     - Disable the compromised secret version to prevent further access or usage:
       ```
       gcloud secrets versions disable [SECRET_VERSION_NAME] --secret=[SECRET_NAME] --project=[PROJECT_ID]
       ```
     - Rotate the secret by creating a new version and updating the applications or services that use the secret:
       ```
       gcloud secrets versions add [SECRET_VERSION_NAME] --secret=[SECRET_NAME] --data-file=[NEW_SECRET_FILE] --project=[PROJECT_ID]
       ```
     - Review and update the IAM policies and access controls to ensure proper permissions are in place for managing secrets:
       ```
       gcloud secrets set-iam-policy [SECRET_NAME] [POLICY_FILE] --project=[PROJECT_ID]
       ```
     - Monitor and alert on any suspicious activities or access attempts to prevent future security incidents.

Note: Replace `[SECRET_VERSION_NAME]`, `[SECRET_NAME]`, `[PROJECT_ID]`, `[NEW_SECRET_FILE]`, `[POLICY_FILE]` with the actual values specific to your environment.
