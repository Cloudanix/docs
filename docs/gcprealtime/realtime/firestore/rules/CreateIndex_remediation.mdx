#### Example

- One possible way security can be impacted with the `google.firestore.admin.v1.FirestoreAdmin.CreateIndex` event in GCP Realtime for Firestore is if an unauthorized user gains access to the event and uses it to create malicious indexes or modify existing ones. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or cause performance issues.

- Ensure that proper access controls are in place for the Firestore Admin API and the Realtime Database. Only authorized users should have access to create or modify indexes.
- Regularly review and monitor the Firestore indexes to identify any unauthorized changes. This can be done using the Firestore Admin API or the GCP Console.

```
gcloud firestore indexes list --project [PROJECT_ID]
```

Example CLI command to create a Firestore index:
```
gcloud firestore indexes create --project [PROJECT_ID] --collection-group [COLLECTION_GROUP] --field-configs '[{"fieldPath": "fieldName", "order": "ASCENDING"}]'
```

Note: Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your GCP project ID and `[COLLECTION_GROUP]` with the desired collection group name.
