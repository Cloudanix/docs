### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure event in gcprealtime for GCPIAM indicates a failed login attempt in Google Cloud Platform's Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.
- This event is triggered when a user or service account fails to authenticate or authorize their login request.
- It is important to monitor and investigate these events as they may indicate potential security threats or misconfigurations in IAM policies.

#### Example

- Example: If a "google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure" event is triggered in GCPIAM, it indicates that there has been a failed login attempt in the Google Cloud Platform Identity and Access Management (GCPIAM) service. This event could potentially impact the security of the system as it suggests unauthorized access attempts.

- Remediation:
  1. Investigate the event: Analyze the event details to determine the source and nature of the failed login attempt. Check the user or service account associated with the event and review the timestamp, IP address, and other relevant information.
  2. Strengthen authentication: Ensure that strong authentication mechanisms are in place, such as enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts and service accounts.
  3. Monitor and alert: Set up monitoring and alerting systems to promptly detect and respond to any suspicious login activities. Utilize Cloud Monitoring or Cloud Logging to create custom metrics or logs-based alerts for failed login attempts.

- GCP CLI command for monitoring failed login attempts:
  ```
  gcloud logging read "resource.type=project AND logName=projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity AND protoPayload.methodName=google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure" --project=[PROJECT_ID]
  ```

Note: Replace [PROJECT_ID] with the actual ID of your GCP project.
