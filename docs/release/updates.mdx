## [July 26th]

### Graphs are now clickable!

Summary screens display several charts. For e.g. in Audit you see "Severity" pie chart. If you want to drill down on a particular slice of Severity (say "High"), you can click it and the page should refresh with updated results.

In addition you will also notice that these filter criteria are updated in the Filter control on the Top. You can use this Filter control to remove the criteria.

### Why should you care?

It makes slicing and dicing of information much easy. Instead of sorting the grid in Findings tab, you can first build your Filter criteria using either the graphs or the Filter Control on the top and then consume the results in a much faster way.
