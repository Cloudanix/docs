### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The CreateRegexPatternSet event in AWS WAF refers to the action of creating a new regex pattern set for use in web application firewall (WAF) rules.
- A regex pattern set is a collection of regular expressions that can be used to match and block or allow specific patterns in web requests.
- This event indicates that a new regex pattern set has been created, which can then be used in WAF rules to protect web applications from common security threats such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

#### Example

- It is possible for the security to be impacted with a CreateRegexPatternSet event in AWS WAF if the regex pattern set is not properly configured or if it contains malicious patterns.
- Remediation: 
  1. Validate the regex patterns in the pattern set to ensure they are correctly formed and do not introduce any security vulnerabilities.
  2. Regularly review and update the pattern set to include new patterns that may be used in attacks.
  3. Monitor WAF logs and set up alerts to detect any suspicious activity or potential attacks.

Example CLI command to create a regex pattern set in AWS WAF:
```
aws wafv2 create-regex-pattern-set --name <pattern-set-name> --scope REGIONAL --description <description>
```

Example CLI command to add a regex pattern to a pattern set in AWS WAF:
