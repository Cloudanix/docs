### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteRegexPatternSet event in AWS WAF refers to the action of deleting a regex pattern set from the Web Application Firewall (WAF) service.
- This event indicates that a specific regex pattern set, which contains regular expressions used for matching and blocking malicious patterns in web requests, has been removed from the WAF configuration.
- Deleting a regex pattern set can be done through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or API, and it is typically performed when the set is no longer needed or requires an update.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteRegexPatternSet event in AWS WAF:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and triggers the DeleteRegexPatternSet event, they can delete a regex pattern set that is being used to protect against specific types of attacks, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). This can leave the application vulnerable to these types of attacks.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteRegexPatternSet event in AWS WAF:
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API activity in the AWS account. This will help in identifying any unauthorized access or suspicious activities.
   - Implement strict IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to modify or delete WAF resources.
   - Regularly backup the regex pattern sets and store them in a secure location. This will allow for easy restoration in case of accidental deletion or unauthorized access.

3. AWS CLI command to restore a deleted regex pattern set in AWS WAF:
   ```
   aws waf-regional create-regex-pattern-set --name <pattern-set-name> --region <region>
   ```

   Note: Replace `<pattern-set-name>` with the name of the deleted pattern set and `<region>` with the appropriate AWS region.
