### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet event in AWS WAF refers to the action of deleting a SQL injection match set.
- A SQL injection match set is a collection of rules that AWS WAF uses to identify and block SQL injection attacks.
- When the DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet event occurs, it means that a SQL injection match set has been removed from the AWS WAF configuration, and any associated rules and conditions are no longer active.

#### Example

- The DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet event in AWS WAF can impact security if it is triggered accidentally or maliciously by an unauthorized user. This event deletes a SQL injection match set, which is a collection of rules used to identify and block SQL injection attacks.

Possible example of how security can be impacted:
1. Accidental deletion: A user with administrative privileges mistakenly deletes a SQL injection match set while managing the AWS WAF configuration. This can result in the removal of important rules that were protecting the application from SQL injection attacks.

Remediation:
1. Regular backups: Take regular backups of the AWS WAF configuration, including the SQL injection match sets. This ensures that in case of accidental deletion, the configuration can be restored quickly.
2. Implement strict access controls: Limit the permissions of users who can modify or delete AWS WAF resources. Follow the principle of least privilege and grant only the necessary permissions to avoid accidental or unauthorized deletions.
3. Enable AWS CloudTrail: Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity and monitor for any unexpected or unauthorized deletions. This provides visibility into the actions performed on AWS WAF resources and helps in identifying and investigating any security incidents.

Example CLI command to create a backup of AWS WAF configuration:
```
aws wafv2 get-web-acl --name <web-acl-name> --scope CLOUDFRONT --region <region> > waf-backup.json
```

Example CLI command to restore AWS WAF configuration from backup:
```
aws wafv2 create-web-acl --name <web-acl-name> --scope CLOUDFRONT --region <region> --rules file://waf-backup.json
```

Note: Replace `<web-acl-name>` with the actual name of the web ACL and `<region>` with the desired AWS region.
