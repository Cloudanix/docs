### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The CreateKey event in awsrealtime for KMS refers to the action of creating a new customer master key (CMK) in AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
- This event indicates that a new encryption key has been generated, which can be used to encrypt and decrypt data in various AWS services and applications.
- The CreateKey event is an important event to monitor as it signifies the establishment of a new key that can be used to protect sensitive data in the AWS environment.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and performs a CreateKey event in AWS KMS, they can create a new customer master key (CMK) without proper authorization. This can lead to unauthorized access to encrypted data and compromise the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.

Remediation:
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all IAM users and roles to prevent unauthorized access to the AWS account.
- Implement strong IAM policies and restrict the permissions for creating and managing CMKs to only trusted and authorized users.
- Regularly monitor CloudTrail logs for any suspicious CreateKey events and set up alerts to notify security teams in real-time.
- Consider using AWS CloudHSM to store and manage CMKs securely, providing an additional layer of protection.

AWS CLI command to enable MFA for an IAM user:
```
aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME> --serial-number <MFA_DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER> --authentication-code1 <CODE1> --authentication-code2 <CODE2>
```

AWS CLI command to create an IAM policy for restricting CMK creation:
```
aws iam create-policy --policy-name <POLICY_NAME> --policy-document file://policy.json
```

2. Example of security impact: If an attacker gains access to an EC2 instance with elevated privileges and executes a malicious script or command to perform a CreateKey event in AWS KMS, they can create a new CMK and gain unauthorized access to encrypted data.

Remediation:
- Implement strong security practices for EC2 instances, such as regularly patching and updating the operating system and applications, using strong passwords, and disabling unnecessary services.
- Follow the principle of least privilege by assigning IAM roles and policies to EC2 instances that restrict the ability to perform CreateKey events in AWS KMS.
- Monitor EC2 instances for any suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts using AWS CloudTrail and other security monitoring tools.
- Enable AWS CloudWatch Logs to capture and analyze logs from EC2 instances, including any suspicious activities related to KMS.

AWS CLI command to assign an IAM role to an EC2 instance:
```
aws ec2 associate-iam-instance-profile --instance-id <INSTANCE_ID> --iam-instance-profile Name=<IAM_INSTANCE_PROFILE_NAME>
```

AWS CLI command to enable CloudWatch Logs for an EC2 instance:
```
aws ec2 create-logs --instance-id <INSTANCE_ID> --log-group-name <LOG_GROUP_NAME> --log-stream-name <LOG_STREAM_NAME>
```

3. Example of security impact: If an insider threat or a compromised AWS account performs a CreateKey event in AWS KMS, they can create a new CMK and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, bypassing existing access controls and encryption mechanisms.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls and regularly review and update IAM policies to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to create CMKs.
- Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture all API activities, including CreateKey events, and store the logs in a secure and centralized location for monitoring and analysis.
- Implement a robust identity and access management strategy, including regular rotation of access keys and the use of temporary security credentials.
- Regularly audit and review CMKs to identify any unauthorized or unused keys and revoke them.

AWS CLI command to enable CloudTrail for an AWS account:
```
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <TRAIL_NAME> --s3-bucket-name <S3_BUCKET_NAME> --is-multi-region --include-global-service-events
```

AWS CLI command to rotate access keys for an IAM user:
```
aws iam update-access-key --access-key-id <ACCESS_KEY_ID> --status Inactive
aws iam create-access-key --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME>
```
