### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteRolePolicy event in AWS IAM refers to the action of deleting a policy attached to an IAM role.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process removes a policy from a specific IAM role.
- It is important to monitor this event as it can indicate changes in the permissions and access control of IAM roles within your AWS environment.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteRolePolicy event in AWS IAM:
   - An attacker gains unauthorized access to an IAM user or role with sufficient permissions to delete role policies.
   - The attacker deletes a critical role policy, such as a policy that restricts access to sensitive resources or enforces security controls.
   - As a result, the security posture of the affected resources is compromised, allowing unauthorized access or actions.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteRolePolicy event in AWS IAM:
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users and roles to add an extra layer of security.
   - Regularly review and audit IAM policies and roles to identify any unauthorized changes or suspicious activities.
   - Implement AWS CloudTrail to capture and monitor API activity, including IAM events, and set up alerts for any unexpected or unauthorized actions.

3. AWS CLI command to restore a deleted role policy:
   - If a role policy is accidentally deleted, it can be restored using the `put-role-policy` command in AWS CLI.
   - First, identify the role ARN and the policy document that was deleted.
   - Then, use the following command to restore the deleted policy:
     ```
     aws iam put-role-policy --role-name <role-name> --policy-name <policy-name> --policy-document file://<path-to-policy-document>
     ```
     Replace `<role-name>`, `<policy-name>`, and `<path-to-policy-document>` with the appropriate values.
