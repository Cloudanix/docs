### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteSigningCertificate event in AWS IAM refers to the action of deleting a signing certificate associated with an IAM user.
- This event is triggered when a user or an administrator removes a signing certificate from an IAM user's account.
- The DeleteSigningCertificate event can be used to track and audit changes made to signing certificates in an AWS IAM environment.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteSigningCertificate event in AWS IAM:
   - An attacker gains unauthorized access to an IAM user's credentials and uses them to delete the signing certificate associated with the user. This can compromise the user's identity and potentially allow the attacker to perform malicious actions on behalf of the user.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteSigningCertificate event:
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access to user credentials.
   - Regularly monitor IAM events and set up CloudWatch alarms to detect and alert on any unexpected or suspicious activities, such as the deletion of signing certificates.
   - Implement strong password policies and enforce regular password rotation to minimize the risk of credential compromise.

3. AWS CLI command to enable MFA for an IAM user:
   ```
   aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME> --serial-number <MFA_DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER> --authentication-code1 <CODE1> --authentication-code2 <CODE2>
   ```

Note: Replace `<IAM_USER_NAME>` with the actual IAM user name, `<MFA_DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER>` with the serial number of the MFA device, and `<CODE1>` and `<CODE2>` with the authentication codes provided by the MFA device.
