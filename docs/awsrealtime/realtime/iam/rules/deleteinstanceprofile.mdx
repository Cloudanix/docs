### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteInstanceProfile event in AWS IAM refers to the deletion of an instance profile. 
- An instance profile is a container for an IAM role that you can use to pass role information to an EC2 instance when the instance starts. 
- When the DeleteInstanceProfile event occurs, it means that an instance profile has been successfully deleted from the AWS account.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteInstanceProfile event in AWS IAM:
   - If an attacker gains unauthorized access to an AWS IAM user or role with sufficient permissions, they can potentially delete an instance profile. This can lead to the compromise of EC2 instances associated with that instance profile, as the deleted profile will no longer provide necessary permissions for the instances to function properly.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteInstanceProfile event:
   - Regularly review and audit IAM policies and permissions to ensure that only necessary permissions are granted to users and roles.
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture all API activities, including DeleteInstanceProfile events, and regularly monitor the CloudTrail logs for any suspicious or unauthorized activities.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
   - Implement least privilege principles by granting only the minimum required permissions to IAM users and roles, reducing the potential impact of compromised credentials.

3. AWS CLI command to delete an instance profile:
   - To delete an instance profile using AWS CLI, you can use the `delete-instance-profile` command:
     ```
     aws iam delete-instance-profile --instance-profile-name <instance-profile-name>
     ```
     Replace `<instance-profile-name>` with the name of the instance profile you want to delete.
