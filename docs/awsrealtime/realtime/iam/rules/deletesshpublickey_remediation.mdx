### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteSSHPublicKey event in awsrealtime for IAM refers to the action of deleting an SSH public key associated with an IAM user.
- This event indicates that a user has removed an SSH public key from their IAM user account, which is used for SSH authentication.
- It is important to monitor this event as it can help track changes made to SSH access for IAM users and ensure the security of the AWS environment.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteSSHPublicKey event in AWS IAM:
   - An attacker gains unauthorized access to an IAM user's credentials and uses them to delete the SSH public key associated with the user's account.
   - This can lead to a compromised user account, allowing the attacker to perform unauthorized actions or gain further access to sensitive resources within the AWS environment.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteSSHPublicKey event:
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Regularly rotate SSH keys and monitor for any unauthorized changes to SSH public keys associated with IAM users.
   - Implement strong password policies and enforce regular password rotations to minimize the risk of credential compromise.

3. AWS CLI command to list SSH public keys for IAM users:
   ```
   aws iam list-ssh-public-keys --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME>
   ```

   AWS CLI command to delete an SSH public key for an IAM user:
   ```
   aws iam delete-ssh-public-key --user-name <IAM_USER_NAME> --ssh-public-key-id <SSH_PUBLIC_KEY_ID>
   ```

   Note: Replace `<IAM_USER_NAME>` with the actual IAM user name and `<SSH_PUBLIC_KEY_ID>` with the ID of the SSH public key to be deleted.
