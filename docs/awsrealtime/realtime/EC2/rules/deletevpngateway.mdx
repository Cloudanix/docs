### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteVpnGateway event in AWS EC2 refers to the action of deleting a virtual private network (VPN) gateway.
- A VPN gateway is a networking component that allows for secure communication between a virtual private cloud (VPC) and an on-premises network or another VPC.
- The DeleteVpnGateway event indicates that a VPN gateway has been removed from the EC2 environment, potentially impacting the connectivity and communication between the VPC and external networks.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteVpnGateway event in AWS EC2:
   - If a malicious actor gains unauthorized access to the AWS account or EC2 instance, they could potentially execute the DeleteVpnGateway event to remove a VPN gateway. This could disrupt secure communication between on-premises networks and the AWS VPC, potentially exposing sensitive data or services to unauthorized access.

2. Remediation for security impact caused by DeleteVpnGateway event:
   - Implement strong security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the AWS account, such as using multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts and regularly rotating access keys.
   - Enable CloudTrail logging to capture all API calls, including DeleteVpnGateway events, and regularly review the logs for any suspicious activity. 

3. AWS CLI command to restore a deleted VPN gateway:
   - If a VPN gateway is accidentally deleted or compromised, it can be restored using the `create-vpn-gateway` command in the AWS CLI. Here's an example command:
     ```
     aws ec2 create-vpn-gateway --type ipsec.1 --availability-zone <availability-zone>
     ```
     Replace `<availability-zone>` with the desired availability zone for the VPN gateway.
