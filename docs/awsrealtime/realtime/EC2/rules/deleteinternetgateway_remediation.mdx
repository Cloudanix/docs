### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteInternetGateway event in AWS EC2 refers to the action of deleting an internet gateway from a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud).
- This event indicates that the internet gateway, which allows communication between instances in the VPC and the internet, has been removed.
- It is important to note that deleting an internet gateway will result in the loss of internet connectivity for instances within the VPC, unless an alternative internet gateway or NAT gateway is configured.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteInternetGateway event in AWS EC2:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and triggers the DeleteInternetGateway event, it can result in the removal of the internet gateway associated with the VPC. This can lead to a loss of internet connectivity for the resources within the VPC, impacting the availability of services and potentially exposing sensitive data.

2. Remediation steps for mitigating the impact of DeleteInternetGateway event:
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the AWS account to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access.
   - Implement strict IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies to control access to the AWS resources. Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to modify or delete critical resources like internet gateways.
   - Regularly monitor AWS CloudTrail logs to detect any unauthorized or suspicious activities. Set up alerts or notifications to be notified in real-time when critical resources are modified or deleted.

3. Bash script example to restore an accidentally deleted internet gateway in AWS EC2:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Replace <INTERNET_GATEWAY_ID> with the ID of the deleted internet gateway
   # Replace <VPC_ID> with the ID of the VPC to which the internet gateway was attached

   # Create a new internet gateway
   NEW_GATEWAY_ID=$(aws ec2 create-internet-gateway --query 'InternetGateway.InternetGatewayId' --output text)

   # Attach the new internet gateway to the VPC
   aws ec2 attach-internet-gateway --internet-gateway-id $NEW_GATEWAY_ID --vpc-id <VPC_ID>

   # Restore the route table entry for internet access
   aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id <ROUTE_TABLE_ID> --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 --gateway-id $NEW_GATEWAY_ID
   ```
   Note: The above script assumes that you have the necessary AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials and permissions. Replace the placeholder values with the actual IDs of the resources in your environment.
