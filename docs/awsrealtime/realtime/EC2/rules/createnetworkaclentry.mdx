### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The CreateNetworkAclEntry event in awsrealtime for EC2 refers to the action of creating a new entry in a network access control list (ACL) for an EC2 instance in AWS.
- Network ACLs act as a virtual firewall for controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
- This event indicates that a new rule has been added to the network ACL, specifying the allowed or denied traffic based on the specified criteria such as source/destination IP address, port, and protocol.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If a CreateNetworkAclEntry event in AWS Real-time for EC2 is misconfigured or unauthorized, it can potentially allow unauthorized network traffic to access the associated subnet or instances. For example, if a network ACL entry is created with an overly permissive rule that allows all inbound traffic from any source IP address, it can compromise the security of the EC2 instances by exposing them to potential attacks.

Remediation:
- Identify the misconfigured or unauthorized CreateNetworkAclEntry event by reviewing the AWS CloudTrail logs or real-time event stream.
- Remove or modify the problematic network ACL entry to ensure it aligns with the desired security policies.
- Use the AWS CLI to modify the network ACL entry. For example, to remove a specific entry, you can use the following command:
  ```
  aws ec2 delete-network-acl-entry --network-acl-id <network-acl-id> --rule-number <rule-number>
  ```
- Regularly review and audit network ACL configurations to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege and follow security best practices.

2. Example of security impact: Another possible security impact of a CreateNetworkAclEntry event in AWS Real-time for EC2 is the accidental exposure of sensitive ports or services to the public internet. For instance, if a network ACL entry is created that allows inbound traffic on port 22 (SSH) from any source IP address, it can potentially lead to unauthorized access attempts and compromise the security of the EC2 instances.

Remediation:
- Identify the misconfigured or unauthorized CreateNetworkAclEntry event by reviewing the AWS CloudTrail logs or real-time event stream.
- Modify the network ACL entry to restrict access to only trusted IP addresses or ranges.
- Use the AWS CLI to modify the network ACL entry. For example, to update a specific entry to allow SSH access only from a specific IP range, you can use the following command:
  ```
  aws ec2 replace-network-acl-entry --network-acl-id <network-acl-id> --rule-number <rule-number> --protocol <protocol> --port-range From=<from-port>,To=<to-port> --cidr-block <trusted-ip-range> --rule-action <allow-or-deny>
  ```
- Regularly review and update network ACL configurations to ensure they align with the organization's security policies and requirements.

3. Example of security impact: A CreateNetworkAclEntry event in AWS Real-time for EC2 can also lead to inadvertent exposure of internal resources by misconfiguring outbound network ACL entries. For instance, if a network ACL entry is created that allows all outbound traffic to any destination IP address, it can potentially expose sensitive data or resources to unauthorized external entities.

Remediation:
- Identify the misconfigured or unauthorized CreateNetworkAclEntry event by reviewing the AWS CloudTrail logs or real-time event stream.
- Modify the outbound network ACL entry to restrict outbound traffic based on the organization's security policies and requirements.
- Use the AWS CLI to modify the network ACL entry. For example, to update a specific outbound entry to allow outbound traffic only to specific IP ranges, you can use the following command:
  ```
  aws ec2 replace-network-acl-entry --network-acl-id <network-acl-id> --egress --rule-number <rule-number> --protocol <protocol> --port-range From=<from-port>,To=<to-port> --cidr-block <allowed-destination-ip-range> --rule-action <allow-or-deny>
  ```
- Regularly review and audit outbound network ACL configurations to ensure they are properly configured and aligned with the organization's security requirements.
