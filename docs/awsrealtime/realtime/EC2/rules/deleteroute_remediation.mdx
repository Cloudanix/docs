### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteRoute event in AWS EC2 refers to the removal of a route from a route table in the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network.
- This event indicates that a specific route, which was previously configured to direct traffic to a specific destination, has been deleted.
- The DeleteRoute event can be triggered manually by an administrator or through an automated process, and it affects the routing of network traffic within the VPC.

#### Example

1. Example of how security can be impacted with DeleteRoute event in AWS EC2:
   - If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account or EC2 instance, they may attempt to delete a route in the route table associated with the instance. This can disrupt network connectivity and potentially allow the attacker to redirect traffic to malicious destinations.

2. Remediation steps for mitigating the impact of DeleteRoute event in AWS EC2:
   - Regularly monitor and review the CloudTrail logs to identify any unauthorized or suspicious activities related to route table modifications.
   - Implement strong access controls and follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to modify route tables.
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AWS accounts to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access.

3. AWS CLI command to restore a deleted route in a route table:
   - To restore a deleted route in a route table, you can use the `create-route` command in the AWS CLI. Here's an example command:
     ```
     aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id <route-table-id> --destination-cidr-block <destination-cidr-block> --gateway-id <gateway-id>
     ```
     Replace `<route-table-id>`, `<destination-cidr-block>`, and `<gateway-id>` with the appropriate values for your environment.
