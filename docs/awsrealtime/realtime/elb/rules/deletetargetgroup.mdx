### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The DeleteTargetGroup event in AWS Real-time for ELB refers to the deletion of a target group associated with an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) in the AWS environment.
- This event indicates that the target group, which is responsible for routing traffic to registered targets, has been removed from the ELB configuration.
- The DeleteTargetGroup event can be triggered manually by an administrator or through an automated process, and it signifies the removal of the target group and its associated settings from the ELB setup.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the AWS account and triggers a DeleteTargetGroup event for an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), it can lead to a potential security breach. This event can result in the removal of a target group from the ELB, causing disruption to the application's availability and potentially exposing sensitive data or services.

Remediation:
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the AWS account to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access.
- Implement strict IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies to control access to the ELB and target groups. Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to modify or delete target groups.
- Regularly monitor CloudTrail logs for any suspicious activities related to ELB events, including DeleteTargetGroup. Set up CloudWatch alarms to notify administrators of any unauthorized or unexpected changes to the ELB configuration.

Example CLI command to enable MFA for an IAM user:
```
aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name <user-name> --serial-number <mfa-serial-number> --authentication-code1 <code1> --authentication-code2 <code2>
```

Example CLI command to create an IAM policy allowing only specific users to modify or delete target groups:
```
aws iam create-policy --policy-name <policy-name> --policy-document file://policy.json
```

Example policy.json file content:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "elasticloadbalancing:DeleteTargetGroup",
        "elasticloadbalancing:ModifyTargetGroup"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:<region>:<account-id>:targetgroup/<target-group-name>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: Replace `<user-name>`, `<mfa-serial-number>`, `<code1>`, `<code2>`, `<policy-name>`, `<region>`, `<account-id>`, and `<target-group-name>` with the appropriate values.
