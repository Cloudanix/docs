### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Read sensitive file untrusted" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process running within a container attempted to read a file that contains sensitive information, such as passwords, private keys, or configuration files.
- This event suggests that there might be a potential security breach or unauthorized access to sensitive data within the cluster.
- It is crucial to investigate this event promptly to identify the source of the unauthorized access and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risk, such as reviewing access controls, securing the sensitive files, and monitoring for any further suspicious activities.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected pod:
   - Use `kubectl get pods` to list all the pods in the cluster.
   - Look for the pod that triggered the event by checking the pod name or any other relevant information provided in the event.
   - Note down the name of the affected pod for further steps.

2. Delete the affected pod:
   - Use `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>` to delete the affected pod.
   - This will terminate the pod and prevent any further execution of the malicious script.

3. Investigate and remediate the underlying issue:
   - Review the bash script or python script that was used to read the sensitive file.
   - Identify any vulnerabilities or insecure practices in the script.
   - Update the script to ensure it follows best practices and complies with security standards.
   - Consider implementing proper access controls and encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive files.

Note: It is important to thoroughly investigate the root cause of the event and address any security vulnerabilities in the scripts to prevent similar incidents in the future.
