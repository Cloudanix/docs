### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Container Run as Root User event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a container is running with the root user privileges.
- Running containers as the root user can pose a security risk as it grants unrestricted access to the underlying host system.
- Compliance standards such as CIS Kubernetes Benchmark recommend running containers with non-root users to minimize the potential impact of security vulnerabilities. 

To address this event:
- Identify the specific container that is running as the root user by checking the container's security context or the user specified in the Dockerfile.
- Update the container's security context or Dockerfile to run as a non-root user.
- Use Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict the permissions of the container and limit its access to the host system.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected container: Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster. Look for the pod that triggered the "Container Run as Root User" event. Note down the pod name.

2. Update the pod's security context: Use the `kubectl edit pod <pod-name>` command to edit the pod's configuration. Locate the `securityContext` section and set the `runAsNonRoot` field to `true`. This ensures that the container runs as a non-root user.

3. Verify the changes: Use the `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` command to check if the pod has been updated successfully. Look for the `Security Context` section and ensure that the `RunAsNonRoot` field is set to `true`. Additionally, you can also check the pod logs to ensure that the container is running without root privileges.

Note: It is recommended to follow the principle of least privilege and avoid running containers as the root user unless absolutely necessary.
