### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Container Run as Root User event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a container is running with the root user privileges.
- Running containers as the root user can pose a security risk as it grants unrestricted access to the underlying host system.
- Compliance standards such as CIS Kubernetes Benchmark recommend running containers with non-root users to minimize the potential impact of security vulnerabilities. 

To address this event:
1. Identify the specific container that is running as root using the container ID or name.
2. Update the container's security context by specifying a non-root user in the pod's security context or using the `securityContext` field in the container definition.
3. Rebuild and redeploy the container with the updated configuration to ensure it runs with a non-root user.

#### Remediation

To remediate the "Container Run as Root User" event, you can use the following bash script or kubectl commands:

Bash Script:
1. Identify the affected pod(s) by querying the Kubernetes API:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   PODS=$(kubectl get pods -o json | jq -r '.items[] | select(.spec.securityContext.runAsUser == 0) | .metadata.name')
   ```

2. Patch the security context of the affected pod(s) to run as a non-root user:
   ```bash
   for POD in $PODS; do
       kubectl patch pod $POD --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/securityContext/runAsUser", "value": <non-root-user-id>}]'
   done
   ```

Python Script:
1. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```python
   import subprocess

   def install_libraries():
       subprocess.run(["pip", "install", "kubernetes"])
   ```

2. Identify the affected pod(s) by querying the Kubernetes API:
   ```python
   from kubernetes import client, config

   def get_affected_pods():
       config.load_kube_config()
       v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
       pods = v1.list_pod_for_all_namespaces().items
       affected_pods = [pod.metadata.name for pod in pods if pod.spec.security_context.run_as_user == 0]
       return affected_pods
   ```

3. Patch the security context of the affected pod(s) to run as a non-root user:
   ```python
   def remediate_pods(pods, non_root_user_id):
       config.load_kube_config()
       v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
       for pod in pods:
           patch_body = [{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/securityContext/runAsUser", "value": non_root_user_id}]
           v1.patch_namespaced_pod(pod, pod.metadata.namespace, patch_body)
   ```

Note: Replace `<non-root-user-id>` with the desired non-root user ID in the bash script, and `non_root_user_id` in the Python script.
