### Event Information

#### Meaning

- This event indicates that there is unauthorized outbound or inbound traffic from a process in a Kubernetes cluster to a server on a port that is not whitelisted.
- It could potentially signify a security breach or a misconfiguration in the network policies of the cluster.
- To investigate further, you can use the following kubectl command to check the network policies and configurations: 
  ```kubectl get networkpolicies```

#### Remediation

- Create a NetworkPolicy to restrict outbound or inbound traffic to unauthorized server process and port:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: restrict-traffic
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  - Ingress
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: authorized-server
    ports:
    - port: 80
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: authorized-server
    ports:
    - port: 80
```

- Apply the NetworkPolicy to the namespace where the unauthorized traffic is occurring:
```bash
kubectl apply -f networkpolicy.yaml -n <namespace>
```

- Ensure that the pods in the namespace are labeled correctly to enforce the NetworkPolicy:
```bash
kubectl label pods -n <namespace> app=authorized-server
```
