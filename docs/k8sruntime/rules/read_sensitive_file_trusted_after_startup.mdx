### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Read sensitive file trusted after startup" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process running within a container has accessed a sensitive file after the container has started up, and this access is considered trusted.
- This event could occur when a containerized application needs to read sensitive configuration files or credentials during runtime.
- It is important to ensure that the sensitive files are properly protected and access to them is restricted to only authorized processes and users. Regularly review and update file permissions and access controls to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

#### Remediation

1. Create a Kubernetes Deployment manifest file to deploy a Python script that will remediate the event:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: remediation-script
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: remediation-script
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: remediation-script
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: remediation-script
        image: python:3
        command: ["python", "/app/remediate.py"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: sensitive-files
          mountPath: /sensitive-data
      volumes:
      - name: sensitive-files
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/sensitive/files
          type: Directory
```

2. Write a Python script (remediate.py) to remediate the event by securely deleting the sensitive file:
```python
import os

def remediate_event():
    sensitive_file_path = "/sensitive-data/sensitive-file"
    
    # Check if the sensitive file exists
    if os.path.exists(sensitive_file_path):
        try:
            # Securely delete the sensitive file
            os.remove(sensitive_file_path)
            print(f"Sensitive file at {sensitive_file_path} deleted successfully.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error occurred while deleting the sensitive file: {e}")
    else:
        print(f"Sensitive file at {sensitive_file_path} does not exist.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    remediate_event()

```

3. Apply the Deployment manifest file using kubectl to deploy the remediation script:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Note: Make sure to replace /path/to/sensitive/files with the correct directory where the sensitive files are stored. Also, ensure that /path/to/sensitive/files in the manifest corresponds to the location on the node or host where the sensitive files are stored.
