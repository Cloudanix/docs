### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The System user interactive event in a Kubernetes cluster refers to an event where a system user, such as root or an administrator, interacts with the cluster.
- This event could indicate potential security risks, as system users typically have elevated privileges and their actions should be closely monitored.
- To investigate this event, you can use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster and check for any suspicious activities or unauthorized access by system users.

#### Remediation

To remediate the falco event "System user interactive" using a bash script or kubectl commands, you can follow these steps:

1. Bash Script:
   - Create a bash script, e.g., "remediate_system_user_interactive.sh".
   - Use the "usermod" command to disable the user's interactive login. For example:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     usermod -s /sbin/nologin <username>
     ```
   - Replace `<username>` with the actual username that triggered the event.
   - Save and execute the script using `./remediate_system_user_interactive.sh`.

2. Kubectl Commands:
   - Identify the pod where the event occurred. You can use the falco output to find the pod name.
   - Execute a shell inside the pod using the following command:
     ```bash
     kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -- /bin/bash
     ```
   - Use the "usermod" command to disable the user's interactive login. For example:
     ```bash
     usermod -s /sbin/nologin <username>
     ```
   - Replace `<username>` with the actual username that triggered the event.
   - Exit the shell and the changes will be applied to the pod.

3. Python Script:
   - Import the `subprocess` module in your Python script.
   - Use the `subprocess.run()` function to execute the bash script or kubectl commands mentioned above.
   - For example, using the bash script approach:
     ```python
     import subprocess
     
     subprocess.run(["./remediate_system_user_interactive.sh"], shell=True)
     ```
   - Make sure the bash script is in the same directory as the Python script.
   - Execute the Python script to trigger the remediation process.

Remember to test the remediation script thoroughly before applying it in a production environment.
