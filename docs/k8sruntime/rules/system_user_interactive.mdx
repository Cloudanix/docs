### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The System user interactive event in a Kubernetes cluster refers to an event where a system user, such as root or an administrator, interacts with the cluster.
- This event could indicate potential security risks, as system users typically have elevated privileges and their actions should be closely monitored.
- To investigate this event, you can use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster and check for any suspicious activities or unauthorized access by system users.

#### Remediation

To remediate the event "System user interactive" using the Python Kubernetes API, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected pod:
   - Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster.
   - Look for the pod that triggered the "System user interactive" event.
   - Note down the name of the pod.

2. Create a Kubernetes manifest file to update the pod:
   - Use the `kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml > pod.yaml` command to export the current pod configuration to a YAML file.
   - Open the `pod.yaml` file and make the necessary changes to remediate the event.
   - For example, you can modify the `securityContext` section to restrict interactive access by setting `runAsNonRoot: true` and `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`.

3. Apply the updated manifest file:
   - Use the Python Kubernetes API to apply the updated manifest file.
   - Load the `pod.yaml` file using the `yaml` module in Python.
   - Use the `create_namespaced_pod` or `patch_namespaced_pod` method to apply the changes to the pod.
   - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify the pod.

Note: Make sure to test the changes in a non-production environment before applying them to production.
