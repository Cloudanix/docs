### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Modify binary dirs" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process running within a container has attempted to modify the binary directories on the file system.
- This event could potentially indicate unauthorized access or tampering with the system binaries, which can be a security concern.
- To investigate further, you can use the `kubectl exec` command to access the container and inspect the binary directories for any unauthorized changes. For example: `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash`

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected pod: Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster. Look for the pod that triggered the "Modify binary dirs" event in the falco alert. Note down the name of the pod.

2. Inspect the pod's container: Use the `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` command to get detailed information about the pod. Look for the container name within the pod that triggered the event.

3. Revert the changes and update the container image: If the modification was unauthorized, you should revert the changes made to the binary directories. This can be done by rolling back to a previous version of the container image or by updating the container image to a known good version. Use the `kubectl edit deployment <deployment-name>` command to modify the container image in the deployment manifest. Update the image tag to the desired version and save the changes.

Note: It is important to investigate the root cause of the unauthorized modification and implement preventive measures to avoid similar incidents in the future.
