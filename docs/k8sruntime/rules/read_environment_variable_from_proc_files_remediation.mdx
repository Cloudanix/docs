### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Read environment variable from proc files" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process running within a container is attempting to read environment variables from the /proc filesystem.
- This event could potentially indicate a security concern, as reading environment variables from /proc can expose sensitive information such as passwords or API keys.
- To investigate this event, you can use the kubectl command to check the logs of the container where the event occurred. For example, you can use "kubectl logs <pod_name> -c <container_name>" to view the logs and look for any suspicious activity related to reading environment variables from /proc.

#### Remediation

1. Create a Kubernetes ConfigMap to store the environment variables:
   - Create a YAML file named `configmap.yaml` with the following content:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: ConfigMap
     metadata:
       name: env-vars
     data:
       MY_ENV_VAR: <value>
     ```
   - Replace `<value>` with the desired value for the environment variable.
   - Apply the ConfigMap using the following command:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml
     ```

2. Update the deployment to use the ConfigMap:
   - Modify the YAML file of the deployment that reads the environment variable from `/proc` files.
   - Add the `envFrom` field under the `spec.template.spec.containers` section:
     ```yaml
     envFrom:
       - configMapRef:
           name: env-vars
     ```
   - Apply the updated deployment using the following command:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
     ```

3. Verify the environment variable is being read correctly:
   - Check the logs of the pod associated with the deployment to ensure the environment variable is being read correctly.
     ```
     kubectl logs <pod-name>
     ```
   - Look for the output that confirms the environment variable value is as expected.

Note: Make sure to replace `<pod-name>` with the actual name of the pod associated with the deployment.
