### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Read environment variable from proc files" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process running within a container is attempting to read environment variables from the /proc filesystem.
- This event could be a potential security concern as it may expose sensitive information stored in environment variables to unauthorized users or processes.
- To investigate this event, you can use the kubectl command to check the logs of the container where the event occurred. For example, you can use `kubectl logs <pod_name> -c <container_name>` to view the logs and identify any suspicious activity related to reading environment variables from proc files.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected pod: Use the kubectl command `kubectl get pods` to list all the pods in the cluster. Look for the pod that triggered the "Read environment variable from proc files" event in the falco alert. Note down the name of the pod.

2. Review the pod's configuration: Use the kubectl command `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to get detailed information about the pod. Look for any environment variables that are being read from the proc files. Pay attention to any sensitive information being exposed.

3. Update the pod's configuration: If you find any environment variables being read from the proc files that are not necessary or contain sensitive information, update the pod's configuration to remove or secure them. You can do this by editing the pod's YAML file and removing the unnecessary or sensitive environment variables. Then, apply the changes using the command `kubectl apply -f <pod-yaml-file>`.
