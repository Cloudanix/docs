### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Java Process Class File Download event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a Java process running within a container is attempting to download a class file from an external source.
- This event could potentially indicate a security vulnerability or a misconfiguration, as downloading class files from external sources can introduce untrusted code into the application.
- To investigate this event, you can use kubectl to check the logs of the container where the Java process is running, and analyze the network traffic to identify the source of the class file download.

#### Remediation

To remediate the event "Java Process Class File Download" using the Python Kubernetes API, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected pod:
   - Use the Kubernetes API to list all pods in the cluster: `kubectl get pods`
   - Look for the pod that triggered the event based on the pod name or other identifying information.

2. Delete the affected pod:
   - Use the Kubernetes API to delete the pod: `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>`

3. Apply a Pod Security Policy (PSP) to prevent future occurrences:
   - Create a Pod Security Policy manifest file with the necessary restrictions and permissions.
   - Apply the PSP to the cluster: `kubectl apply -f <psp-manifest-file>`

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to perform these actions in your Kubernetes cluster.
