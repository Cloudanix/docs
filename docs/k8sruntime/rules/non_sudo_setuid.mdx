### Event Information

#### Meaning

The "Non sudo setuid" event in a Kubernetes cluster refers to a situation where a non-root user attempts to execute a process with the setuid permission, which allows the process to run with the privileges of the file owner. This event can have security implications and may violate compliance standards. Here are three key points about this event:

1. Security risk: The "Non sudo setuid" event indicates that a non-root user is attempting to execute a process with elevated privileges. This can be a security risk as it may allow unauthorized access or privilege escalation within the cluster.

2. Compliance violation: Many compliance standards, such as PCI DSS or HIPAA, require strict control over user privileges and access. The "Non sudo setuid" event violates these standards as it allows non-root users to execute processes with elevated privileges.

3. Investigation and mitigation: To address this event, it is important to investigate the process and user involved. Check if the process is legitimate and necessary for the cluster's operation. If not, remove or restrict the process. Additionally, review user permissions and ensure that only authorized users have the necessary privileges to execute processes with elevated permissions.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected pod: Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster. Look for the pod that triggered the Non sudo setuid event in the Falco alert. Note down the name of the pod.

2. Inspect the pod's container: Use the `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` command to get detailed information about the pod. Look for the container name within the pod that triggered the event.

3. Update the container's security context: Edit the deployment or pod specification YAML file for the affected pod using `kubectl edit deployment <deployment-name>` or `kubectl edit pod <pod-name>`. Add or modify the `securityContext` section to set the `runAsNonRoot` and `runAsUser` properties appropriately. Ensure that the container is not running with root privileges and is using a non-root user.

Example YAML snippet for the security context:
```
spec:
  containers:
  - name: <container-name>
    securityContext:
      runAsNonRoot: true
      runAsUser: <non-root-user-id>
```

Save the changes and exit the editor. Kubernetes will automatically update the pod with the new configuration.

Note: Ensure that the non-root user specified in the `runAsUser` property has the necessary permissions and access within the container to perform its intended tasks.
