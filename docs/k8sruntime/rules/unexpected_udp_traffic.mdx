### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Unexpected UDP Traffic event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that there is unexpected UDP traffic detected within the cluster.
- This event could be a potential security concern as it may indicate unauthorized or malicious network activity.
- To investigate and mitigate this event, you can use the following steps:
  1. Identify the source and destination of the unexpected UDP traffic by checking the source IP address and port number.
  2. Use network monitoring tools like tcpdump or Wireshark to capture and analyze the network traffic.
  3. Review the network policies and firewall rules in your Kubernetes cluster to ensure that only authorized UDP traffic is allowed. Use `kubectl get networkpolicies` to list the network policies and `kubectl describe networkpolicy <policy-name>` to get more details about a specific policy.

#### Remediation

Bash Script:
1. Identify the source IP address of the unexpected UDP traffic using the falco event details.
2. Use the iptables command to block incoming UDP traffic from the identified source IP address.
3. Save the iptables rules to persist across reboots.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Extract source IP address from falco event details
SOURCE_IP="<source_ip_address>"

# Block incoming UDP traffic from the identified source IP address
iptables -A INPUT -p udp -s $SOURCE_IP -j DROP

# Save iptables rules to persist across reboots
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

Python Script:
1. Use the subprocess module to execute the kubectl command to identify the source IP address of the unexpected UDP traffic.
2. Use the subprocess module to execute the kubectl command to create a NetworkPolicy that blocks incoming UDP traffic from the identified source IP address.
3. Handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the kubectl commands.

```python
import subprocess

# Extract source IP address from falco event details
source_ip = "<source_ip_address>"

try:
    # Create NetworkPolicy to block incoming UDP traffic from the identified source IP address
    subprocess.run(["kubectl", "apply", "-f", "-"], input=f"""

    ports:
    - protocol: UDP
""", check=True, text=True)
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error executing kubectl command: {e}")
```

Note: Replace `<source_ip_address>` with the actual source IP address obtained from the falco event details.
