### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Directory traversal monitored file read event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process within a container is attempting to read a file outside of its designated directory.
- This event could potentially be a security vulnerability as it may allow an attacker to access sensitive files or execute arbitrary code.
- To investigate and mitigate this event, you can use kubectl to check the container's security context, ensure that appropriate file permissions are set, and review the container's configuration to prevent unauthorized file access.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected pod: Use the kubectl command `kubectl get pods` to list all the pods in the cluster. Look for the pod that triggered the Directory Traversal Monitored File Read event.

2. Update the pod's security context: Edit the pod's YAML file using `kubectl edit pod <pod-name>` and add a security context to restrict the pod's access to the file system. Set the `readOnlyRootFilesystem` field to `true` to prevent any write access to the file system.

3. Implement Pod Security Policies (PSP): PSPs allow you to define fine-grained security policies for pods in your cluster. Create a PSP that enforces restrictions on file system access and apply it to the cluster using `kubectl apply -f <psp-file.yaml>`. Then, update the pod's YAML file to include the `securityContext` field and set the `runAsUser` and `runAsGroup` fields to non-root values to further restrict access.

Note: Ensure that the remediation steps align with your organization's compliance standards and security policies.
