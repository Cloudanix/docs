### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The "Write below root" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process running within a container attempted to write or modify files or directories that are located below the root directory ("/") of the container's file system.

2. This event can be a potential security concern as it may indicate unauthorized access or tampering with critical system files or directories.

3. To investigate and address this event, you can perform the following actions:
   - Identify the specific container and pod where the event occurred using the Kubernetes cluster's monitoring or logging tools.
   - Inspect the container's security context and ensure that it has appropriate access controls and restrictions in place.
   - Review the container's configuration and deployment files to ensure that only necessary file system paths are mounted and writable by the container.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected pod: Use the kubectl command `kubectl get pods` to list all the pods in the cluster. Look for the pod that triggered the Write below root event by checking the pod name and namespace.

2. Review the pod's security context: Use the kubectl command `kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>` to get detailed information about the pod. Look for the security context section and ensure that the pod is not running with privileged access or with a user ID of 0 (root).

3. Update the pod's security context: If the pod's security context allows write access below root, modify the pod's YAML file and add or update the securityContext section. Set the appropriate values for the runAsUser and allowPrivilegeEscalation fields to restrict write access below root. Then, apply the changes using the kubectl command `kubectl apply -f <pod-file.yaml>`.

Note: It is important to review and understand the impact of these changes on the application running inside the pod before applying them.
