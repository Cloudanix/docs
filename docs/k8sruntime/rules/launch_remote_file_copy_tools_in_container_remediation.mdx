### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Launch Remote File Copy Tools in Container event indicates that a process within a container is attempting to use remote file copy tools, such as scp or rsync, to transfer files to or from the container.
- This event could potentially indicate unauthorized data exfiltration or the introduction of malicious files into the container.
- To investigate this event, you can use kubectl to inspect the container and its processes, check for any suspicious files or network connections, and review the container's security policies and access controls.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected container:
   - Use `kubectl get pods` to list all the running pods in the cluster.
   - Identify the pod name where the event occurred.

2. Remove the affected container:
   - Use `kubectl delete pod <pod_name>` to delete the pod with the affected container.
   - This will terminate the container and prevent any further malicious activity.

3. Implement Pod Security Policies (PSP):
   - Create a Pod Security Policy that restricts the usage of privileged containers and prevents the execution of remote file copy tools.
   - Apply the PSP to the cluster using `kubectl apply -f <psp_file.yaml>`.
   - Ensure that all pods are using the PSP by default using `kubectl apply -f <psp_binding.yaml>`.

Note: The provided remediation steps assume that you have already identified the specific container and pod where the event occurred.
