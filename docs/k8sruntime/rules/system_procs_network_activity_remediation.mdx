### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The System procs network activity event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that there is suspicious network activity happening within the system processes.
- It could be a sign of a potential security breach or unauthorized network communication.
- This event should be investigated further to identify the source of the network activity and take appropriate actions to mitigate any potential risks.

#### Remediation

Bash script:
1. Identify the suspicious network activity by analyzing the event details.
2. Use the `netstat` command to list all network connections and filter out the suspicious ones based on the event details.
3. Kill the suspicious network connections using the `kill` command.

Example bash script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Identify the suspicious network activity
# Replace <event_details> with the specific details from the event
suspicious_connections=$(netstat -tuln | grep <event_details>)

# Kill the suspicious network connections
while read -r line; do
    # Extract the PID from the line
    pid=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $7}' | awk -F '/' '{print $1}')
    # Kill the process
    kill -9 "$pid"
done <<< "$suspicious_connections"
```

Python script:
1. Use the `subprocess` module in Python to execute kubectl commands.
2. Identify the suspicious network activity by analyzing the event details.
3. Use the `subprocess.run()` function to execute the kubectl command to delete the suspicious network connections.

Example Python script:
```python
import subprocess

# Identify the suspicious network activity
# Replace <event_details> with the specific details from the event
suspicious_connections = "<event_details>"

# Delete the suspicious network connections using kubectl
kubectl_command = f"kubectl delete pod --all --field-selector=status.phase!=Running"
subprocess.run(kubectl_command, shell=True, check=True)
```

Note: Make sure to replace `<event_details>` with the actual details from the falco event in both the bash and python scripts.
