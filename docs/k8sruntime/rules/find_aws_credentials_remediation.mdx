### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Find AWS Credentials" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process or container within the cluster is attempting to search for AWS credentials.
- This event could be a potential security risk as it may indicate unauthorized access or an attempt to gain access to AWS resources.
- To investigate this event, you can use kubectl to check the logs of the relevant pods or containers to identify the process or application responsible for the event. For example, you can use the following command: `kubectl logs <pod_name>`.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected pod: Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster. Look for any pods that are flagged as having the "Find AWS Credentials" event. Note down the name of the affected pod.

2. Delete the affected pod: Use the `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>` command to delete the affected pod. This will terminate the pod and any running containers within it. Kubernetes will automatically create a new pod to replace the deleted one.

3. Review and update pod security: To prevent future occurrences of the "Find AWS Credentials" event, review and update the security measures in place for your pods. This may include implementing RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), using secrets instead of environment variables for sensitive information, and regularly scanning and updating container images for vulnerabilities.
