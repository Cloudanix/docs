### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Launch Ingress Remote File Copy Tools in Container event indicates that a process within a container is attempting to copy files remotely using ingress functionality.
- This event could potentially be a security concern as it may indicate unauthorized access or data exfiltration from the container.
- To investigate this event, you can use the following kubectl command to check the logs of the container: `kubectl logs <pod_name> -c <container_name>`. This will help you identify the source and destination of the file copy operation.

#### Remediation

To remediate the event "Launch Ingress Remote File Copy Tools in Container" using the Python Kubernetes API, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected container:
   - Use the Kubernetes API to list all the pods in the cluster: `kubectl get pods -o wide`
   - Look for the pod that triggered the event and note down its name and namespace.

2. Delete the affected pod:
   - Use the Python Kubernetes API to delete the pod identified in the previous step.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```python
     from kubernetes import client, config

     # Load the Kubernetes configuration
     config.load_kube_config()

     # Create the Kubernetes API client
     api = client.CoreV1Api()

     # Delete the pod
     api.delete_namespaced_pod(name="pod-name", namespace="pod-namespace")
     ```

3. Investigate and mitigate the root cause:
   - Analyze the pod's YAML manifest to identify how the ingress remote file copy tools were launched.
   - Update the pod's manifest to remove any unauthorized or suspicious containers or commands.
   - Apply the updated manifest to the cluster using the `kubectl apply` command.

Please note that the above steps assume you have the necessary permissions to delete pods and modify pod manifests in the cluster. Make sure to test the remediation script in a non-production environment before applying it to a production cluster.
