### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The System user interactive event in a Kubernetes cluster refers to an event where a system user, such as root or an administrator, interacts with the cluster.
- This event could indicate potential security risks, as system users typically have elevated privileges and their actions should be closely monitored.
- To investigate this event, you can use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster and check for any suspicious activities or unauthorized access by system users.

#### Remediation

To remediate the event "System user interactive" using the Python Kubernetes API, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected pod:
   - Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster.
   - Look for the pod that triggered the "System user interactive" event.
   - Note down the name of the pod.

2. Modify the pod's security context to prevent interactive access and enforce best practices. This includes:
   - Ensuring the pod does not run as a privileged user.
   - Disabling privilege escalation.
   - Export the current configuration of the affected pod:
   ```bash
     kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml > pod.yaml
   ```
   - Edit the pod.yaml file to update the securityContext section:
   ```yaml
   spec:
   securityContext:
      runAsNonRoot: true
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      capabilities:
         drop:
         - ALL
   ```


3. Apply the Updated Configuration:
   ```bash
      kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
   ```


Note: Make sure to test the changes in a non-production environment before applying them to production.
