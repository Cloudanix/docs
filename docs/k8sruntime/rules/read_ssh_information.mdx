### Event Information

#### Meaning



#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected pod: Use the following command to get the pod name where the event occurred:
   ```
   kubectl get events --field-selector reason=ReadSshInfoUsingPythonKubernetesApi
   ```

2. Delete the affected pod: Once you have identified the pod, delete it using the following command:
   ```
   kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
   ```

3. Update the deployment: If the pod is part of a deployment, update the deployment to create a new pod. This will ensure that the application continues to run:
   ```
   kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment-name>
   ```

Note: Make sure to investigate the root cause of the event and implement necessary security measures to prevent unauthorized access to SSH information in the future.
