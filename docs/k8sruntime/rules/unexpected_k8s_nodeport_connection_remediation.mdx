### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Unexpected K8s NodePort Connection event indicates that a connection has been made to a NodePort service in the Kubernetes cluster, which was not expected based on the defined network policies.
- This event could potentially indicate a security breach or unauthorized access attempt, as it suggests that traffic is being directed to a service that should not be accessible from outside the cluster.
- To investigate this event, you can use the following kubectl command to list all the NodePort services in the cluster: `kubectl get services --field-selector type=NodePort`. This will help identify the specific service that is receiving the unexpected connection.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected Kubernetes service and its NodePort value.
   - Use the `kubectl get services` command to list all services in the cluster.
   - Look for the service with the NodePort value mentioned in the event.
   - Note down the service name and NodePort value.

2. Create a Kubernetes manifest file to update the service.
   - Use the `kubectl get service <service-name> -o yaml` command to get the current service manifest.
   - Save the output to a file, e.g., `service.yaml`.
   - Open `service.yaml` in a text editor.

3. Update the `spec.type` field in the manifest file.
   - Change the value of `spec.type` from `NodePort` to `ClusterIP`.
   - Save the changes to `service.yaml`.

4. Apply the updated manifest file to the cluster.
   - Use the `kubectl apply -f service.yaml` command to apply the changes.
   - Verify that the service has been updated by running `kubectl get services` again.

Note: This remediation script assumes that the unexpected NodePort connection is not required and can be replaced with a ClusterIP service. Make sure to review the impact of this change on your application before applying it in a production environment.
