### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Unexpected inbound connection source event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a network connection was established from an unexpected source to a pod or service within the cluster.
- This event could potentially indicate a security breach or unauthorized access attempt, as it suggests that a connection was made from an external source that is not whitelisted or expected.
- To investigate this event, you can use kubectl commands to check the network policies, pod logs, and cluster firewall rules to identify any potential misconfigurations or security vulnerabilities. For example, you can use "kubectl get networkpolicies" to list the network policies in the cluster and "kubectl logs <pod-name>" to view the logs of a specific pod.

#### Remediation

Bash script:
1. Identify the source IP address of the unexpected inbound connection using the falco event details.
2. Use the iptables command to block the incoming connection from the identified IP address.
3. Save the iptables rules to persist across reboots.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Extract the source IP address from the falco event details
SOURCE_IP=<source_ip_address>

# Block the incoming connection from the identified IP address using iptables
iptables -A INPUT -s $SOURCE_IP -j DROP

# Save the iptables rules to persist across reboots
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

Python script:
1. Use the subprocess module to execute the kubectl command to get the pod name associated with the falco event.
2. Use the kubectl command to delete the pod identified in the previous step.
3. Optionally, you can use the kubectl command to create a new pod to replace the deleted one.

```python
import subprocess

# Execute kubectl command to get the pod name associated with the falco event
pod_name = subprocess.check_output(["kubectl", "get", "pods", "--all-namespaces", "--field-selector", "status.phase=Running", "--output", "jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'"])

# Delete the identified pod using kubectl command
subprocess.call(["kubectl", "delete", "pod", pod_name])

# Optionally, create a new pod to replace the deleted one
subprocess.call(["kubectl", "create", "-f", "path/to/new_pod.yaml"])
```

Note: Replace `<source_ip_address>` with the actual source IP address in the bash script, and make sure to provide the correct path to the new pod YAML file in the Python script.
