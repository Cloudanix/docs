### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Read sensitive file trusted after startup" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process running within a container has accessed a sensitive file after the container has started up, and this access is considered trusted.
- This event could occur when a containerized application needs to read sensitive configuration files or credentials during runtime.
- It is important to ensure that the sensitive files are properly protected and access to them is restricted to only authorized processes and users. Regularly review and update file permissions and access controls to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

#### Remediation

1. Create a Kubernetes Deployment manifest file to deploy a Python script that will remediate the event:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: remediation-script
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: remediation-script
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: remediation-script
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: remediation-script
        image: python:3
        command: ["python", "-c"]
        args: ["<python script to remediate the event>"]
```

2. Write a Python script to remediate the event by deleting the sensitive file:
```python
import os

def remediate_event():
    sensitive_file_path = "/path/to/sensitive/file"
    if os.path.exists(sensitive_file_path):
        os.remove(sensitive_file_path)
        print("Sensitive file deleted successfully.")
    else:
        print("Sensitive file does not exist.")

remediate_event()
```

3. Apply the Deployment manifest file using kubectl to deploy the remediation script:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Note: Make sure to replace `<python script to remediate the event>` with the actual Python script file name or inline script content. Also, update the `sensitive_file_path` variable with the correct path to the sensitive file.
