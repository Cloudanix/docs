#### Remediation

To remediate the event "Delete or rename shell history using python Kubernetes API", you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected Pod:
   - Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the Pods in the cluster.
   - Look for the Pod that triggered the event based on the Pod name or other relevant information.

   - Connect to the affected Pod using the `kubectl exec` command.
   - Execute the appropriate command to delete or rename the shell history file. For example:

   - Check if the shell history file has been deleted or renamed successfully. For example:
