### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The event "Detect crypto miners using the Stratum protocol" indicates that there is suspicious activity related to cryptocurrency mining using the Stratum protocol within the Kubernetes cluster.
- The Stratum protocol is commonly used by mining software to communicate with mining pools, and its presence in the cluster suggests that unauthorized mining activities may be taking place.
- This event could be a potential security concern as unauthorized mining can consume significant computing resources, impact performance, and potentially violate compliance standards.

To investigate and mitigate this event in a Kubernetes cluster:
1. Identify the affected pod(s) by checking the pod name and namespace mentioned in the event. Use the following command to list all pods in the cluster:
   ```
   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
   ```
2. Inspect the logs of the suspicious pod(s) to gather more information about the detected Stratum protocol activity. Use the following command to view the logs of a specific pod:
   ```
   kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace>
   ```
3. Take appropriate actions based on the findings, such as terminating the suspicious pod(s), investigating the source of the unauthorized mining software, and implementing security measures to prevent future occurrences.

#### Remediation

1. Create a Kubernetes Deployment manifest file to deploy a Python script that monitors and terminates any pods using the Stratum protocol:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: stratum-monitor
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: stratum-monitor
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: stratum-monitor
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: stratum-monitor
        image: python:3
        command: ["python", "-u"]
        args: ["stratum_monitor.py"]
```

2. Create a Python script named `stratum_monitor.py` that uses the Kubernetes Python API to monitor and terminate pods using the Stratum protocol:
```python
from kubernetes import client, config

def main():
    config.load_kube_config()
    v1 = client.CoreV1Api()

    while True:
        pods = v1.list_pod_for_all_namespaces().items
        for pod in pods:
            if "stratum" in pod.metadata.name.lower():
                v1.delete_namespaced_pod(pod.metadata.name, pod.metadata.namespace)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

3. Apply the Deployment manifest file using the `kubectl apply` command:
```bash
kubectl apply -f stratum-monitor-deployment.yaml
```

Note: Make sure to have the Kubernetes Python API (`kubernetes` package) installed in the Python environment where the `stratum_monitor.py` script will be executed.
