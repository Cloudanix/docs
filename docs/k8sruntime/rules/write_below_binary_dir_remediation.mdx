### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Write below binary dir" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process running within a container attempted to write or modify files within the binary directory of the container's file system.
- This event could potentially indicate a malicious activity or a misconfiguration, as modifying files within the binary directory can lead to unauthorized changes to the container's executable files.
- To investigate this event, you can use the following commands:
  1. List all running pods in the cluster: `kubectl get pods -A`
  2. Inspect the logs of the suspicious pod: `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace>`
  3. Check the container's file system for any unauthorized modifications: `kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -n <namespace> -- ls -l /path/to/binary/dir`

#### Remediation

1. Bash script:
   - Create a bash script file, e.g., `remediation.sh`, and open it for editing.
   - Add the following lines to the script:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     echo "New content" > /path/to/binary/dir/file.txt
     ```
   - Save and close the file.
   - Make the script executable by running the command: `chmod +x remediation.sh`.
   - Execute the script using: `./remediation.sh`.

2. Kubectl commands:
   - Create a Kubernetes ConfigMap to store the new content:
     ```bash
     kubectl create configmap new-content --from-literal=file.txt="New content"
     ```
   - Create a Pod or Deployment that mounts the ConfigMap as a volume and runs the Python script:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: python-pod
     spec:
       containers:
       - name: python-container
         image: python:latest
         command: ["python", "your_script.py"]
         volumeMounts:
         - name: config-volume
           mountPath: /path/to/binary/dir
       volumes:
       - name: config-volume
         configMap:
           name: new-content
     ```
   - Apply the Pod configuration using: `kubectl apply -f pod.yaml`.

3. Combined bash script and kubectl commands:
   - Create a bash script file, e.g., `remediation.sh`, and open it for editing.
   - Add the following lines to the script:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     echo "New content" > /path/to/binary/dir/file.txt
     kubectl create configmap new-content --from-file=/path/to/binary/dir/file.txt
     kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
     ```
   - Create a Pod configuration file, e.g., `pod.yaml`, with the content from the previous example.
   - Save and close both files.
   - Make the script executable by running the command: `chmod +x remediation.sh`.
   - Execute the script using: `./remediation.sh`.
