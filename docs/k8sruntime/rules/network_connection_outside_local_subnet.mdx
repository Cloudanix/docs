### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Network Connection outside Local Subnet event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a pod or container within the cluster has established a network connection to an IP address outside of the defined local subnet range.
- This event could potentially indicate unauthorized network communication from within the cluster, which may be a security concern.
- To investigate this event, you can use the following steps:
  1. Identify the pod or container involved in the event by checking the relevant metadata in the event details.
  2. Use the `kubectl describe pod <pod_name>` command to gather more information about the pod, including its network configuration.
  3. Review the network policies and firewall rules in place to ensure that only authorized network connections are allowed from within the cluster.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected pod: Use the following command to list all the pods in the cluster and identify the pod with the suspicious network connection:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -o wide
   ```

2. Inspect the pod's network configuration: Once you have identified the pod, use the following command to inspect its network configuration:
   ```
   kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
   ```

3. Implement network policies: To restrict network connections outside the local subnet, you can create a network policy that allows only specific traffic. Here's an example of a network policy that allows traffic within the local subnet:
   ```
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: local-subnet-policy
   spec:
     podSelector: {}
     policyTypes:
     - Ingress
     - Egress
     ingress:
     - from:
       - podSelector: {}
       - ipBlock:
           cidr: <local_subnet_cidr>
     egress:
     - to:
       - podSelector: {}
       - ipBlock:
           cidr: <local_subnet_cidr>
   ```

   Apply the network policy using the following command:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml
   ```

   Note: Replace `<local_subnet_cidr>` with the actual CIDR range of your local subnet.

   This network policy will only allow traffic within the local subnet and block any connections outside of it. Apply this policy to the affected pod or to all pods in the cluster, depending on your requirements.
