### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Launch Disallowed Container event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a container has been attempted to be launched, but it is not allowed based on the defined policies or compliance standards.
- This event typically occurs when a container image or configuration violates the security policies or compliance requirements set for the cluster.
- It is important to investigate the reason behind the disallowed container launch, review the policies in place, and take necessary actions to ensure compliance and security of the cluster. This may involve updating the policies, modifying the container image or configuration, or seeking approval for the container launch if required.

#### Remediation

Bash script:
1. Identify the disallowed container by checking its name or image.
2. Use the `docker stop` command to stop the container.
3. Optionally, use the `docker rm` command to remove the container.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Identify the disallowed container by name or image
CONTAINER_NAME="your-container-name"
CONTAINER_IMAGE="your-container-image"

# Stop the container
docker stop $CONTAINER_NAME

# Remove the container (optional)
docker rm $CONTAINER_NAME
```

Python script:
1. Install the `pykube-ng` library using `pip install pykube-ng`.
2. Use the `pykube.Config` class to load the Kubernetes configuration.
3. Use the `pykube.Pod.objects` class to find the disallowed pod and delete it.

```python
import pykube

# Load Kubernetes configuration
config = pykube.Config.from_file("~/.kube/config")

# Find the disallowed pod
pod_name = "your-pod-name"
api = pykube.HTTPClient(config)
pod = pykube.Pod.objects(api).get_by_name(pod_name)

# Delete the pod
pod.delete()
```

Note: Make sure to replace the placeholders (`your-container-name`, `your-container-image`, `your-pod-name`) with the actual values specific to your environment.
