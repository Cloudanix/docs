### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The User mgmt binaries event in a Kubernetes cluster refers to the detection of suspicious or unauthorized usage of user management binaries, such as `useradd`, `usermod`, or `userdel`.
- This event indicates that someone may be attempting to create, modify, or delete user accounts on the cluster, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
- It is important to investigate this event promptly to ensure that only authorized users have access to the cluster and to prevent any potential security breaches. 

To investigate this event, you can:
- Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all running pods in the cluster and check for any suspicious or unauthorized pods.
- Review the logs of the affected pods using the `kubectl logs <pod_name>` command to look for any suspicious activities related to user management binaries.
- Check the cluster's RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) configuration using the `kubectl get roles`, `kubectl get rolebindings`, `kubectl get clusterroles`, and `kubectl get clusterrolebindings` commands to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions for user management operations.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected user management binaries by reviewing the falco event details. Look for any suspicious or unauthorized changes to the binaries.
   - Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all running pods in the cluster.
   - Inspect the containers within the pods using `kubectl describe pod <pod_name>` to identify the affected containers.

2. Take immediate action to mitigate the security impact:
   - If the affected binaries are part of the container image, rebuild the image with the correct and secure version of the binaries.
   - If the binaries are modified within the running container, terminate the affected pods using `kubectl delete pod <pod_name>` and let the Kubernetes scheduler recreate them with the correct binaries.

3. Implement preventive measures to avoid similar incidents in the future:
   - Regularly update and patch the container images to ensure they include the latest security fixes.
   - Implement image scanning and vulnerability assessment tools to detect any potential security issues in the container images.
   - Restrict access to the user management binaries by applying appropriate RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) policies to limit who can modify or execute these binaries.
