### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Run shell untrusted" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a shell command was executed within a container running in the cluster, and it was flagged as untrusted.
- This event typically occurs when a user or process attempts to run a shell command that is not allowed or violates the security policies defined for the cluster.
- It is important to investigate this event further to determine the source of the command and assess whether it poses a security risk or violates any compliance standards. 

To investigate further, you can:
- Use the `kubectl get pods` command to identify the pod in which the event occurred.
- Use the `kubectl logs <pod-name>` command to view the logs of the container and look for any suspicious or unauthorized shell commands.
- Review the security policies and access controls in place to ensure that only trusted and authorized commands are allowed to be executed within the cluster.

#### Remediation
1. Update Security Policies:
   - Use Security Context Constraints (SCC) or Pod Security Policies (PSP) Alternatives.
   - Since PodSecurityPolicy is deprecated, consider using alternative solutions like Kubernetes PodSecurityAdmission or OPA/Gatekeeper  to enforce security policies.

   - Kubernetes PodSecurityAdmission (PSA) provides a built-in way to enforce security policies. Hereâ€™s an example of how to enforce security controls using PSA:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: policy/v1
    kind: PodSecurityPolicy
    metadata:
      name: restricted
    spec:
      privileged: false
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      allowedCapabilities: []
      volumes:
        - 'emptyDir'
        - 'configMap'
        - 'projected'
        - 'secret'
      hostNetwork: false
      hostIPC: false
      hostPID: false
      runAsUser:
        rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot'
      seLinux:
        rule: 'Must'
      supplementalGroups:
        rule: 'MustNot'
      fsGroup:
        rule: 'MustNot'
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
    ```
    - Implement OPA/Gatekeeper Policies Open Policy Agent (OPA) and Gatekeeper can be used to enforce custom policies. For example, you can create a policy that restricts the execution of untrusted shell commands:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
     kind: K8sSecurityContextConstraints
     metadata:
       name: restrict-shell-commands
     spec:
       enforcementAction: deny
       match:
         kinds:
           - apiGroups: [""]
             kinds: [Pod]
       parameters:
         securityContext:
           runAsNonRoot: true
           allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
           capabilities:
             drop:
               - ALL
     ```

3. Update Deployment or Pod Specifications:
   - Ensure that new pods adhere to the updated security policies by modifying their configurations:
   ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: your-deployment
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          securityContext:
            runAsNonRoot: true
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          containers:
          - name: your-container
            securityContext:
              allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
              capabilities:
                drop:
                  - ALL
     ```

4. Apply the updated security policies and configurations to your cluster:
```bash
     kubectl apply -f <policy-file.yaml>
     kubectl apply -f <deployment-file.yaml>
```

Note: Make sure to test all changes in a staging environment before applying them to production to avoid any unintended disruptions.
