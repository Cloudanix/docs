### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Launch Suspicious Network Tool in Container event indicates that a container within the Kubernetes cluster has attempted to launch a network tool that is considered suspicious or potentially malicious.
- This event could suggest that an attacker is attempting to gain unauthorized access or perform network reconnaissance within the cluster.
- It is important to investigate this event further to identify the container and take appropriate actions such as isolating the affected container, analyzing its contents, and patching any vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.

To investigate further, you can use the following kubectl commands:
1. List all running pods in the cluster: `kubectl get pods -A`
2. Describe the suspicious pod: `kubectl describe pod <pod_name> -n <namespace>`
3. Check the logs of the suspicious pod: `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace>`

#### Remediation

1. Bash script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the container ID where the suspicious network tool is running
container_id=$(kubectl get pods -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | xargs -I {} kubectl get pod {} -o jsonpath='{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.status.containerStatuses[0].containerID}{"\n"}' | grep suspicious-network-tool | awk '{print $2}')

# Stop and delete the container
kubectl delete pod $container_id
```

2. Python script:
```python
import subprocess

# Get the container ID where the suspicious network tool is running
container_id = subprocess.check_output("kubectl get pods -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | xargs -I {} kubectl get pod {} -o jsonpath='{.metadata.name}{\"\t\"}{.status.containerStatuses[0].containerID}{\"\n\"}' | grep suspicious-network-tool | awk '{print $2}'", shell=True).decode().strip()

# Stop and delete the container
subprocess.run(f"kubectl delete pod {container_id}", shell=True)
```

Note: Replace "suspicious-network-tool" with the actual name or label of the suspicious network tool container.

3. Kubectl commands:
```bash
# Get the pod name where the suspicious network tool is running
pod_name=$(kubectl get pods -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | grep suspicious-network-tool)

# Stop and delete the pod
kubectl delete pod $pod_name
```

Note: Replace "suspicious-network-tool" with the actual name or label of the suspicious network tool container.
