### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Linux Kernel Module Injection Detected event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process attempted to inject a kernel module into the Linux kernel.
- This event is a potential security threat as it can allow unauthorized access and control over the system.
- It is important to investigate this event further to identify the source of the injection attempt and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risk, such as removing the malicious module and securing the affected system.

To investigate and mitigate this event in a Kubernetes cluster:
1. Identify the affected pod or node using the Kubernetes event logs or monitoring tools.
2. Inspect the pod or node for any suspicious processes or files using the following command: `kubectl exec <pod-name> -- <command>`
3. If a malicious module is found, remove it using the appropriate command for your Linux distribution, such as `rmmod` or `modprobe -r`. Additionally, consider implementing security measures like restricting kernel module loading and monitoring for any further attempts.

#### Remediation

Bash script:
1. Identify the malicious kernel module using the event details.
   - Use the `dmesg` command to check the kernel logs for any suspicious module loading messages.
   - Extract the module name from the log output.

2. Remove the malicious kernel module.
   - Use the `rmmod` command followed by the module name to unload the module from the kernel.
   - Example: `sudo rmmod <module_name>`

3. Prevent future kernel module injections.
   - Disable the ability to load kernel modules by modifying the kernel configuration.
   - Edit the `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf` file and add the module name to the blacklist.
   - Example: `echo "blacklist <module_name>" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf`

Python script:
1. Use the `subprocess` module to execute the bash commands within the Python script.
   - Import the `subprocess` module: `import subprocess`

2. Execute the bash commands using `subprocess.run()` function.
   - Example: `subprocess.run(["sudo", "rmmod", "<module_name>"])`

3. Handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of the commands.
   - Use `try-except` blocks to catch and handle any exceptions raised by the `subprocess.run()` function.
   - Print appropriate error messages or perform necessary actions based on the exception type.
