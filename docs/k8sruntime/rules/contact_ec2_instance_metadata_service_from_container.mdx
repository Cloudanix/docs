### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Contact EC2 Instance Metadata Service From Container" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a container running in the cluster attempted to access the EC2 instance metadata service.
- This event could be a potential security concern as it may indicate unauthorized access or an attempt to gather sensitive information about the underlying EC2 instance.
- To investigate this event, you can use the following commands:
  1. List all pods in the cluster: `kubectl get pods -A`
  2. Inspect the logs of the suspicious pod: `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace>`
  3. Check the container's configuration and security policies to ensure that accessing the EC2 instance metadata service is authorized and necessary for the application's functionality.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected pod: Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster. Look for the pod that triggered the "Contact EC2 Instance Metadata Service From Container" event.

2. Review the pod's configuration: Use the `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` command to get detailed information about the pod. Look for any misconfigurations or suspicious containers that might be attempting to access the EC2 instance metadata service.

3. Update the pod's security context: If the pod's security context allows access to the EC2 instance metadata service, modify the pod's YAML file and set the `metadata.annotations` field to deny access. Then, use the `kubectl apply -f <pod-file.yaml>` command to apply the changes and update the pod.

Note: It is important to review the pod's configuration and ensure that the access to the EC2 instance metadata service is necessary for the application. In some cases, it might be appropriate to completely disable access to the metadata service by setting the `metadata.annotations` field to deny for all pods in the cluster.
