### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Contact EC2 Instance Metadata Service From Container" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a container running in the cluster attempted to access the EC2 instance metadata service.
- This event could be a potential security concern as it may indicate unauthorized access or an attempt to gather sensitive information about the underlying EC2 instance.
- To investigate this event, you can use the following commands:
  1. List all pods in the cluster: `kubectl get pods -A`
  2. Describe the specific pod associated with the event: `kubectl describe pod <pod_name> -n <namespace>`
  3. Check the container's logs for any suspicious activity: `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace>`

Note: The EC2 instance metadata service provides information about the EC2 instance, such as instance ID, IAM role, and security group information. Access to this service should be restricted to authorized entities only, and unnecessary access should be blocked to ensure compliance with security standards.

#### Remediation

To remediate the event "Contact EC2 Instance Metadata Service From Container" using the Python Kubernetes API, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected pod:
   - Use the Kubernetes API to list all pods in the cluster: `kubectl get pods -o wide`
   - Look for the pod that triggered the event based on the pod name or other identifying information.

2. Update the pod's manifest file:
   - Retrieve the pod's manifest file using the Kubernetes API: `kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml > pod.yaml`
   - Open the `pod.yaml` file and locate the container that made the unauthorized request.
   - Remove or modify the container's configuration to prevent it from contacting the EC2 Instance Metadata Service.
   - Save the changes to the `pod.yaml` file.

3. Apply the updated manifest file:
   - Apply the updated manifest file to the cluster using the Kubernetes API: `kubectl apply -f pod.yaml`
   - Verify that the pod has been updated and is running without triggering the event: `kubectl get pods -o wide`

Note: Make sure to test the updated pod configuration thoroughly before applying it to production environments.
