### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Modify binary dirs" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process running within a container has attempted to modify the binary directories on the underlying host system.
- This event could potentially indicate unauthorized access or tampering with the system binaries, which can be a security concern.
- To investigate further, you can use kubectl to check the logs of the affected pod or container, and review the specific actions performed by the process. For example, you can use the command "kubectl logs `<pod_name>` -c `<container_name>`" to view the logs.

#### Remediation

To remediate the event "Modify binary dirs using python kubernetes api", you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected pod: 
   - Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster.
   - Look for the pod that triggered the event based on the pod name or other relevant information from the event.

2. Secure Binary Directories:
   - Ensure binary directories are protected by setting the appropriate file system permissions.
   - Apply security policies to restrict write access to binary directories.

3. Update Pod Security Context:
   - Modify the pod configuration to prevent containers from modifying binary directories:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
      name: secure-pod
   spec:
   containers:
   - name: secure-container
      image: <your-image>
      securityContext:
         readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
         runAsNonRoot: true
   ```

Note: Remember to test the script in a non-production environment before applying it to your production cluster.
