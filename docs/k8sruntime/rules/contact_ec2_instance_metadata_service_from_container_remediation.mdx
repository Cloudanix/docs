### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Contact EC2 Instance Metadata Service From Container" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a container running in the cluster attempted to access the EC2 instance metadata service.
- This event could be a potential security concern as it may indicate unauthorized access or an attempt to gather sensitive information about the underlying EC2 instance.
- To investigate this event, you can use the following commands:
  1. List all pods in the cluster: `kubectl get pods -A`
  2. Describe the specific pod associated with the event: `kubectl describe pod <pod_name> -n <namespace>`
  3. Check the container's configuration and logs to identify any unauthorized access attempts or misconfigurations.

Note: The EC2 instance metadata service provides information about the EC2 instance, such as instance ID, IAM role, and security group information. Access to this service should be restricted to authorized entities only, and unnecessary access should be avoided to comply with security best practices and compliance standards.

#### Remediation

Bash script:
1. Create a bash script file, e.g., `remediate.sh`.
2. Use the `curl` command to make a request to the EC2 instance metadata service endpoint and retrieve the instance metadata.
3. Add the necessary commands to remediate the issue, such as terminating the container or taking any other appropriate action.

Example bash script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Make a request to the EC2 instance metadata service endpoint
metadata=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/)

# Add necessary commands to remediate the issue
# For example, terminate the container
kubectl delete pod <pod_name> -n <namespace>
```

Python script:
1. Import the `subprocess` module to execute shell commands from within the Python script.
2. Use the `subprocess.run()` function to execute the necessary kubectl command to delete the pod.

Example Python script:
```python
import subprocess

# Execute the kubectl command to delete the pod
subprocess.run(["kubectl", "delete", "pod", "<pod_name>", "-n", "<namespace>"])
```

Note: Replace `<pod_name>` and `<namespace>` with the actual values of the pod you want to delete.
