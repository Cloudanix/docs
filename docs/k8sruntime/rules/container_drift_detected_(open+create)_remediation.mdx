### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Container Drift Detected (open+create) event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a container within a pod has modified or created a file outside of its designated file system.
- This event could be a potential security risk as it may indicate unauthorized access or tampering with the host system.
- To investigate this event, you can use the following steps:
  1. Identify the pod and container involved in the event using the `kubectl describe falcoevents <event_id>` command.
  2. Inspect the container's configuration and security context to ensure that it does not have unnecessary privileges or access to the host file system.
  3. Review the container's logs and any relevant audit logs to identify any suspicious activities or unauthorized file modifications.

#### Remediation

To remediate the "Container Drift Detected (open+create)" event, you can use the following bash script or kubectl commands:

Bash Script:
1. Identify the affected container:
   - Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the running pods in the cluster.
   - Identify the pod associated with the event by checking the pod name or labels.

2. Rollback the container image:
   - Use the `kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name>` command to rollback the deployment associated with the affected pod.
   - This will revert the container image to the previous version, eliminating the drift.

3. Verify the remediation:
   - Use the `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` command to check the status of the pod and ensure that the container drift has been resolved.

Python Script:
1. Install the required Python libraries:
   - Use the `pip install kubernetes` command to install the Kubernetes Python client library.

2. Use the Kubernetes API to remediate the event:
   - Use the Python script to interact with the Kubernetes API and perform the following steps:
     - Retrieve the affected pod using the pod name or labels.
     - Rollback the deployment associated with the pod using the Kubernetes API.
     - Verify the remediation by checking the pod status.

3. Integrate the script into your Python application:
   - Incorporate the remediation script into your existing Python application by calling the necessary functions or methods when the "Container Drift Detected (open+create)" event occurs.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to perform the remediation actions in your Kubernetes cluster.
