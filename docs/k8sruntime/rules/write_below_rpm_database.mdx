### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Write below rpm database" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process running within a container attempted to modify the RPM database located in the host system.
- This event could potentially indicate unauthorized or malicious activity, as modifying the RPM database can lead to tampering with the installed packages and compromising the integrity of the system.
- To investigate this event, you can use the following commands:
  1. List all running pods in the cluster: `kubectl get pods -A`
  2. Inspect the logs of the suspicious pod: `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace>`
  3. Check the container's filesystem for any modifications: `kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -n <namespace> -- ls -l /var/lib/rpm`

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected pod: Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster. Look for the pod that triggered the "Write below rpm database" event in the Falco alert. Note down the name of the pod.

2. Inspect the pod's YAML configuration: Use the `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` command to get detailed information about the pod. Look for any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that could have led to the event. Pay attention to the pod's security context, volume mounts, and container images.

3. Remediate the issue:
   - Update the pod's security context: If the pod's security context is not properly configured, modify the pod's YAML file to set appropriate security context settings. Ensure that the pod runs with the least privileges necessary and that it cannot write to sensitive areas like the RPM database.
   - Verify container images: Check if the container image used by the pod is from a trusted source and does not contain any known vulnerabilities. Use tools like Trivy or Clair to scan the container image for vulnerabilities and update it if necessary.
   - Implement RBAC policies: Ensure that the pod has the necessary Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies in place. Limit the pod's permissions to only what is required for its functionality, preventing unauthorized access to critical resources.

Remember to test the changes in a non-production environment before applying them to the production cluster.
