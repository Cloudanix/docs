### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Clear Log Activities event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that someone has attempted to clear or delete the logs of a specific resource or pod.
- This event could be a potential security concern as it may indicate an attempt to cover up malicious activities or hide evidence of unauthorized access.
- To investigate this event, you can use the following commands:
  - Check the audit logs of the Kubernetes API server to identify the user or service account responsible for the log clearing activity: `kubectl logs -n kube-system <api-server-pod-name>`
  - Review the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) configuration to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to modify or delete logs.
  - Monitor the system for any suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts that may have led to the log clearing event.

#### Remediation

1. Use the Kubernetes Python client library to create a Python script that interacts with the Kubernetes API.
2. Use the `kubectl` command to get the list of pods in the cluster: `kubectl get pods`.
3. Iterate through the list of pods and delete the logs for each pod using the `kubectl logs` command: `kubectl logs <pod_name> --namespace=<namespace> --clear`.

Note: Make sure to replace `<pod_name>` with the actual name of the pod and `<namespace>` with the appropriate namespace where the pod is running.
