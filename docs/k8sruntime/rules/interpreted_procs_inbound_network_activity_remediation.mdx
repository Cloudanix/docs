### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Interpreted procs inbound network activity event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process running within a container is receiving incoming network traffic.
- This event could be triggered when a containerized application is accepting network connections from external sources.
- It is important to investigate this event to ensure that the inbound network activity is expected and compliant with the security policies and compliance standards in place.

To investigate further, you can use the following kubectl command:
```
kubectl get pods
```
This will list all the pods running in the cluster. You can then inspect the specific pod in question using:
```
kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
```
This will provide more details about the pod, including the containers running within it.

#### Remediation

1. Bash script:
   - Use `netstat` command to identify the processes with inbound network activity: 
     ```bash
     netstat -tunap | grep -E ":(80|443)" | awk '{print $7}' | cut -d'/' -f1 | sort -u
     ```
   - Iterate through the list of processes and kill them:
     ```bash
     for pid in $(netstat -tunap | grep -E ":(80|443)" | awk '{print $7}' | cut -d'/' -f1 | sort -u); do
         kill -9 $pid
     done
     ```

2. Python script:
   - Use `psutil` library to identify the processes with inbound network activity:
     ```python
     import psutil
     
     for proc in psutil.process_iter(['pid', 'name', 'cmdline']):
         if any(":80" in conn.laddr or ":443" in conn.laddr for conn in proc.connections()):
             proc.kill()
     ```

3. Kubernetes (kubectl) commands:
   - Identify the pods running the suspicious processes:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.spec.containers[].command[] | contains("python") or contains("bash")) | .metadata.name'
     ```
   - Delete the pods identified:
     ```bash
     kubectl delete pod <pod_name> -n <namespace>
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can scale down the deployment to terminate the pods:
     ```bash
     kubectl scale deployment <deployment_name> --replicas=0 -n <namespace>
     ```
