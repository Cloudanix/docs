### Event Information

#### Meaning

- This event indicates a potential unauthorized outbound connection from a pod in the Kubernetes cluster to a Command and Control (C2) server, which could be a sign of a security breach.
- To investigate further, you can use the following kubectl command to list all the pods in the cluster: 
  ```
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
  ```
- You can then inspect the logs of the suspicious pod using the following kubectl command:
  ```
  kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace>
  ```

#### Remediation

- Create a Kubernetes Deployment manifest file to deploy a Python script that uses the Kubernetes API to monitor and block outbound connections to C2 servers:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: c2-connection-monitor
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: c2-connection-monitor
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: c2-connection-monitor
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: c2-connection-monitor
        image: python:3
        command: ["python", "-c", "import kubernetes; # Add your Python script here to monitor and block outbound connections to C2 servers"]
```

- Create a Kubernetes NetworkPolicy manifest file to restrict egress traffic from the deployment to C2 servers:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: block-c2-egress
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: c2-connection-monitor
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: C2_SERVER_IP/CIDR
```

- Apply the Deployment and NetworkPolicy manifest files to the Kubernetes cluster to remediate the outbound connection to C2 servers event:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f networkpolicy.yaml
```
