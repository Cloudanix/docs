### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Directory traversal monitored file read event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process within a container is attempting to read a file outside of its designated directory.
- This event could potentially be a security vulnerability as it may allow an attacker to access sensitive files or escalate privileges within the cluster.
- To investigate this event, you can use kubectl to check the logs of the container where the event occurred, and analyze the file path that was being accessed. Additionally, you can review the container's security context and ensure that appropriate file system restrictions are in place.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected pod:
   - Use `kubectl get pods` to list all the pods in the cluster.
   - Look for the pod that triggered the Directory Traversal event based on the pod name or other relevant information.

2. Inspect the pod's container:
   - Use `kubectl describe pod <pod_name>` to get detailed information about the pod.
   - Look for the container name within the pod that triggered the event.

3. Access the container and investigate the issue:
   - Use `kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -c <container_name> -- /bin/bash` to access the container's shell.
   - Navigate to the directory mentioned in the event and check for any unauthorized file reads or suspicious activities.
   - Remove any unauthorized scripts or files that may have caused the event.

4. Remediation script (Python):
   ```python
   import subprocess

   def remediate_directory_traversal(pod_name, container_name, directory_path):
       # Step 1: Delete unauthorized files
       delete_command = f"kubectl exec -it {pod_name} -c {container_name} -- /bin/bash -c 'rm -rf {directory_path}/*'"
       subprocess.run(delete_command, shell=True, check=True)

       # Step 2: Verify deletion
       verify_command = f"kubectl exec -it {pod_name} -c {container_name} -- /bin/bash -c 'ls {directory_path}'"
       subprocess.run(verify_command, shell=True, check=True)

   # Usage example
   pod_name = "example-pod"
   container_name = "example-container"
   directory_path = "/path/to/directory"
   remediate_directory_traversal(pod_name, container_name, directory_path)
   ```
   Note: Replace `example-pod`, `example-container`, and `/path/to/directory` with the actual values from your environment.
