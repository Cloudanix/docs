### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Container Drift Detected (chmod) event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that there has been a change in the file permissions (chmod) of a container within a pod.
- This event could be a potential security concern as it suggests that the container's file permissions have been modified, which may indicate unauthorized access or tampering.
- It is important to investigate this event further to determine the cause and take appropriate actions to ensure the integrity and security of the containerized application. 

To investigate further, you can use the following kubectl command:
```
kubectl describe pod <pod_name> -n <namespace>
```
This command will provide detailed information about the pod, including any recent changes in file permissions.

#### Remediation

Bash Script:
1. Identify the affected container by checking the container ID or name mentioned in the event.
2. Use the `docker exec` command to access the container's shell.
3. Run the `chmod` command to set the correct permissions on the file mentioned in the event.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Replace <CONTAINER_ID> with the actual container ID or name
CONTAINER_ID="<CONTAINER_ID>"
FILE_PATH="<FILE_PATH>"
PERMISSIONS="<PERMISSIONS>"

docker exec $CONTAINER_ID chmod $PERMISSIONS $FILE_PATH
```

Python Script:
1. Import the `subprocess` module to execute shell commands.
2. Use the `subprocess.run()` function to run the `kubectl exec` command and access the container's shell.
3. Execute the `chmod` command within the container to set the correct permissions on the file mentioned in the event.

```python
import subprocess

# Replace <POD_NAME> with the actual pod name
POD_NAME="<POD_NAME>"
CONTAINER_NAME="<CONTAINER_NAME>"
FILE_PATH="<FILE_PATH>"
PERMISSIONS="<PERMISSIONS>"

command = f"kubectl exec -it {POD_NAME} -c {CONTAINER_NAME} -- chmod {PERMISSIONS} {FILE_PATH}"
subprocess.run(command, shell=True)
```

Note: Make sure to replace `<CONTAINER_ID>`, `<FILE_PATH>`, `<PERMISSIONS>`, `<POD_NAME>`, and `<CONTAINER_NAME>` with the actual values specific to your environment.
