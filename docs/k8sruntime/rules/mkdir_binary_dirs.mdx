### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Mkdir binary dirs event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process attempted to create a directory using the `mkdir` command.
- This event could be triggered by a legitimate action, such as a containerized application creating a directory for storing temporary files or logs.
- However, it could also be a potential security concern if the directory creation is unauthorized or violates compliance standards. It is important to investigate the source and purpose of the directory creation.

To investigate further, you can:
- Use `kubectl logs <pod_name>` to check the logs of the container where the event occurred. Look for any suspicious or unauthorized directory creation activities.
- Inspect the container's security context and permissions using `kubectl describe pod <pod_name>`. Ensure that the container has appropriate access controls and is not running with excessive privileges.
- Review the Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) configuration to ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary permissions to create directories within the cluster. Use `kubectl get rolebindings` and `kubectl get clusterrolebindings` to list the existing role bindings.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the source of the Mkdir binary dirs event by checking the Falco logs or any other security monitoring tool. Look for the specific container or pod that triggered the event.

2. Review the container or pod configuration to ensure that only trusted and necessary images are being used. Remove any suspicious or unauthorized images.

3. Harden the security of the affected container or pod by implementing the following measures:
   - Update the container image to the latest version to ensure any known vulnerabilities are patched.
   - Restrict the privileges of the container by using Kubernetes Security Contexts or Pod Security Policies. Set the appropriate values for the `runAsUser` and `runAsGroup` fields to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Implement a least privilege principle by removing unnecessary capabilities from the container. Use the `securityContext` field to set the `capabilities` parameter to only include the required capabilities.
   - Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy or Clair, and ensure that images are regularly updated with security patches.

Note: It is important to follow compliance standards and best practices specific to your organization while remediating security issues.
