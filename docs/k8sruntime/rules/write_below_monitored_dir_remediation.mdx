### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Write below monitored dir" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process running within a container has attempted to write or modify a file or directory that is being monitored by a security tool or policy.
- This event could potentially indicate unauthorized or suspicious activity, as it may suggest an attempt to tamper with sensitive files or directories.
- To investigate this event, you can use kubectl to check the logs of the container where the event occurred, and analyze the specific file or directory that was being written to. Additionally, you can review the security policies and permissions in place to ensure they align with compliance standards.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected pod: Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster. Look for the pod that triggered the "Write below monitored dir" event in the falco output. Note down the name of the pod.

2. Inspect the pod's configuration: Use the `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` command to get detailed information about the pod. Look for any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that could have led to the event. Pay attention to the volume mounts and file system permissions.

3. Update the pod's security configuration:
   - Modify the pod's security context: If the pod is running with a privileged security context, consider removing it or reducing the privileges to the minimum required for the application to function properly.
   - Restrict file system access: Review the volume mounts and file system permissions in the pod's configuration. Ensure that the pod only has write access to the necessary directories and restrict access to sensitive or critical directories.
   - Implement Pod Security Policies (PSP): PSPs allow you to define security policies that pods must adhere to. Create and apply a PSP that enforces the necessary restrictions and permissions to prevent unauthorized write access below monitored directories.

Remember to test the changes thoroughly before applying them to production environments. Regularly monitor and review the logs and events to ensure that the remediation measures are effective and compliant with the required security standards.
