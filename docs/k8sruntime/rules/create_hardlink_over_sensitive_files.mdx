### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Create Hardlink Over Sensitive Files event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process attempted to create a hardlink to a sensitive file. 
- This event could potentially be a security concern as it may indicate an unauthorized attempt to modify or access sensitive data. 
- It is important to investigate the source of this event and take appropriate actions to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the sensitive files in the cluster. 

To investigate further, you can:
- Use kubectl to check the logs of the relevant pod or container to identify the process that triggered the event.
- Inspect the file system permissions and ownership of the sensitive files to ensure they are properly secured.
- Consider implementing file integrity monitoring tools or auditing mechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized modifications to sensitive files.

#### Remediation

To remediate the event "Create Hardlink Over Sensitive Files" using the Python Kubernetes API, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected pod:
   - Use the event details to determine the pod name and namespace.
   - Run the following command to get the pod details:
     ```
     kubectl get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml
     ```

2. Create a Kubernetes manifest file to update the pod:
   - Modify the YAML file obtained from the previous step to include a securityContext with the appropriate settings to prevent hardlink creation.
   - Add the following section to the pod's YAML file:
     ```yaml
     spec:
       securityContext:
         allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
         readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
     ```

3. Apply the updated manifest file:
   - Save the modified YAML file.
   - Run the following command to apply the changes to the pod:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f <path-to-updated-manifest-file>
     ```

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to modify the pod and namespace.
