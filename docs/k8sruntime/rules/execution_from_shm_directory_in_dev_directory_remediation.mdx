### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Execution from shm directory in dev directory" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process within a container is attempting to execute a file from the shared memory (shm) directory located in the /dev directory.
- This event could potentially be a security concern as executing files from the shm directory can be a sign of malicious activity or an attempt to bypass security measures.
- To investigate this event, you can use the following kubectl command to check the containers running in the pod: 
  `kubectl describe pod <pod_name>`

Note: The provided kubectl command is a starting point for investigation and may need to be modified based on the specific pod and namespace where the event occurred.

#### Remediation

To remediate the event of execution from the shm directory in the dev directory using the Python Kubernetes API, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected pod:
   - Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster.
   - Look for the pod that triggered the event based on the pod name or other identifying information.
   - Note down the name of the affected pod.

2. Update the pod's manifest file:
   - Use the `kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml > pod.yaml` command to export the pod's manifest file to a YAML file.
   - Open the `pod.yaml` file in a text editor.
   - Find the `securityContext` section under the `spec` section of the YAML file.
   - Add or modify the `securityContext` section to include the `runAsNonRoot: true` and `runAsUser: <non-root-user-id>` fields. This will ensure that the pod runs as a non-root user.
   - Save the changes to the `pod.yaml` file.

3. Apply the updated manifest file:
   - Use the `kubectl apply -f pod.yaml` command to apply the updated manifest file and make the necessary changes to the pod.
   - Verify that the pod has been updated successfully by using the `kubectl get pod <pod-name>` command and checking the pod's status.

Note: Make sure to replace `<pod-name>` with the actual name of the affected pod, and `<non-root-user-id>` with the desired non-root user ID to be used by the pod.
