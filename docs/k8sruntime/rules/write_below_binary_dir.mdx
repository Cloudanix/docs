### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Write below binary dir" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process running within a container attempted to write or modify files within the binary directory of the container's file system.
- This event could potentially indicate a malicious activity or a misconfiguration, as modifying files within the binary directory can lead to unauthorized changes to the container's executable files.
- To investigate this event, you can use the following commands:
  1. List all running pods in the cluster: `kubectl get pods -A`
  2. Inspect the logs of the suspicious pod: `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace>`
  3. Check the container's file system for any unauthorized modifications: `kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -n <namespace> -- ls -l /path/to/binary/dir`

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected pod: Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster. Look for the pod that triggered the "Write below binary dir" event in the falco alert. Note down the name of the pod.

2. Inspect the container: Use the `kubectl exec` command to access the shell of the affected pod. For example, `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash`. Once inside the container, navigate to the directory mentioned in the falco alert and check for any unauthorized files or directories.

3. Update container security policies: Review the security policies for the container image running in the affected pod. Ensure that the container is running with the least privileges necessary and that it does not have write access to critical system directories. Modify the container's security context or apparmor profile to restrict write access to the necessary directories only. Rebuild and redeploy the container with the updated security policies.

Note: It is important to investigate the root cause of the event and ensure that the write access was not intentional or required for the application to function properly.
