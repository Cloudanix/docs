### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Change thread namespace event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process has attempted to change its thread namespace.
- This event can be triggered by a container attempting to escape its own namespace and access resources or processes outside of its intended scope.
- It is important to investigate this event as it may indicate a potential security breach or unauthorized access attempt within the cluster.

To investigate the Change thread namespace event in a Kubernetes cluster, you can:
- Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the running pods in the cluster and identify the pod associated with the event.
- Use the `kubectl logs <pod-name>` command to view the logs of the identified pod and look for any suspicious activities or error messages related to namespace changes.
- Analyze the pod's YAML configuration file using `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to check if any specific configurations or security vulnerabilities might have allowed the namespace change event to occur.

#### Remediation

To remediate the falco event "Change thread namespace" using a bash script or kubectl commands and integrate it into a Python script, you can follow these steps:

1. Bash Script:
   - Create a bash script, e.g., `remediate.sh`, with the following content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     pid=$1
     new_namespace=$2
     nsenter -t $pid -m -u -i -n -p -- bash -c "ip netns exec $new_namespace"
     ```
   - Make the script executable: `chmod +x remediate.sh`
   - In your Python script, when you detect the falco event, you can call the bash script with the required parameters:
     ```python
     import subprocess
     
     pid = 1234  # Replace with the actual PID of the process
     new_namespace = "new_namespace"  # Replace with the desired new namespace
     
     subprocess.run(["./remediate.sh", str(pid), new_namespace])
     ```

2. Kubectl Commands:
   - If you prefer using kubectl commands instead of a bash script, you can use the `exec` command to change the thread namespace of a running container.
   - First, identify the pod and container where the event occurred. You can use `kubectl describe falcoevents <event_id>` to get this information.
   - Once you have the pod and container names, you can execute the following kubectl command to change the thread namespace:
     ```bash
     kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -c <container_name> -- ip netns exec <new_namespace>
     ```
   - In your Python script, when you detect the falco event, you can execute the kubectl command using the `subprocess` module:
     ```python
     import subprocess
     
     pod_name = "my-pod"  # Replace with the actual pod name
     container_name = "my-container"  # Replace with the actual container name
     new_namespace = "new_namespace"  # Replace with the desired new namespace
     
     subprocess.run(["kubectl", "exec", "-it", pod_name, "-c", container_name, "--", "ip", "netns", "exec", new_namespace])
     ```

Remember to replace the placeholders (`<event_id>`, `<pod_name>`, `<container_name>`, `<new_namespace>`) with the actual values specific to your environment.
