### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Network Connection outside Local Subnet event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a pod or container within the cluster has established a network connection to an IP address outside of the defined local subnet range.
- This event could potentially indicate unauthorized network communication from within the cluster, which may be a security concern.
- To investigate this event, you can use the kubectl command to check the network policies applied to the pod or namespace in question, and review the pod's logs for any suspicious activity or unauthorized network connections.

#### Remediation

To generate a remediation script for the falco event "Network Connection outside Local Subnet" using bash script or kubectl commands, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the IP address or subnet that is considered the local subnet in your environment. Let's assume it is 192.168.0.0/24 for this example.

2. Bash script:
   - Use the `iptables` command to block outgoing network connections to IP addresses outside the local subnet:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     iptables -A OUTPUT ! -d 192.168.0.0/24 -j DROP
     ```
   - Save the script to a file, e.g., `remediate_network.sh`, and make it executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x remediate_network.sh
     ```

3. Python script:
   - Use the `subprocess` module in Python to execute the kubectl command to create a NetworkPolicy that blocks egress traffic to IP addresses outside the local subnet:
     ```python
     import subprocess

     def create_network_policy():
         network_policy_yaml = '''
         apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
         kind: NetworkPolicy
         metadata:
           name: block-egress
         spec:
           podSelector: {}
           policyTypes:
           - Egress
           egress:
           - to:
             - ipBlock:
                 cidr: 192.168.0.0/24
                 except:
                 - 192.168.0.0/24
         '''
         subprocess.run(['kubectl', 'apply', '-f', '-'], input=network_policy_yaml.encode(), check=True)
     ```
   - Call the `create_network_policy()` function in your Python script to create the NetworkPolicy.

Remember to customize the local subnet IP address or subnet mask according to your environment. Also, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute the bash script or run kubectl commands.
