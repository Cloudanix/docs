### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Create Symlink Over Sensitive Files event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a process or container attempted to create a symbolic link (symlink) pointing to a sensitive file or directory.
- This event could potentially be a security risk as it may allow unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data or system files.
- It is important to investigate this event further to identify the process or container responsible and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risk, such as removing the symlink, restricting permissions, or implementing file integrity monitoring.

To investigate and mitigate this event in a Kubernetes cluster:
1. Identify the pod or container involved in the event using the Kubernetes audit logs or Falco alerts. For example, you can use the following kubectl command to list all pods in the cluster:
   ```
   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
   ```
2. Once you have identified the pod or container, inspect its configuration and deployment files to ensure that the appropriate security measures are in place. Check for any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that could lead to symlink creation over sensitive files.
3. If the symlink was created intentionally, ensure that proper access controls and permissions are in place to prevent unauthorized access. If it was created maliciously, take immediate action to remove the symlink and investigate any potential data breaches or system compromises.

Remember to follow compliance standards and best practices when investigating and mitigating security events in a Kubernetes cluster.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected pod: Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster. Look for the pod that triggered the "Create Symlink Over Sensitive Files" event.

2. Inspect the pod's containers: Use the `kubectl describe pod <pod_name>` command to get detailed information about the pod. Look for the container that is responsible for the event.

3. Update the container's security context: Modify the pod's YAML file or use the `kubectl edit pod <pod_name>` command to update the container's security context. Set the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` field to `false` and the `readOnlyRootFilesystem` field to `true`. This will prevent the container from creating symlinks over sensitive files and restrict write access to the root filesystem.

4. Apply the changes: Save the modified YAML file or exit the editor after making changes using `kubectl edit`. Then, use the `kubectl apply -f <pod_yaml_file>` command to apply the changes to the pod.

5. Verify the remediation: Monitor the pod's logs and events to ensure that the "Create Symlink Over Sensitive Files" event is no longer triggered. Use the `kubectl logs <pod_name>` command to view the container's logs and `kubectl describe pod <pod_name>` to check for any new events related to the event.
