### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Contact K8S API Server From Container" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a container within the cluster attempted to communicate with the Kubernetes API server.
- This event could be triggered by a containerized application or a process running within a container that requires interaction with the Kubernetes API server for various reasons, such as retrieving cluster information, creating or modifying resources, or querying the status of pods or services.
- It is important to analyze this event to ensure that the container's communication with the Kubernetes API server is legitimate and aligns with the compliance standards of the cluster.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the container that is making unauthorized API calls to the Kubernetes API server by checking the source IP address mentioned in the event. You can use the following command to filter the events related to this specific container:

   ```
   kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=Pod,source_component=kubelet,source_host=<node_name>,source_ip=<container_ip>
   ```

2. Once you have identified the pod associated with the container, review its YAML manifest using the following command:

   ```
   kubectl get pod <pod_name> -n <namespace> -o yaml
   ```

   Look for any suspicious or unauthorized volumes, environment variables, or command arguments that could be used to make unauthorized API calls.

3. Take appropriate actions to remediate the issue, such as:
   - Remove any unauthorized volumes, environment variables, or command arguments from the pod's YAML manifest.
   - Update the container image to a trusted version that does not contain any malicious code.
   - Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to restrict the permissions of the pod/container, ensuring that it only has the necessary privileges to perform its intended tasks.

Remember to follow the principle of least privilege and regularly review and update your pod configurations to minimize the risk of unauthorized API calls.
