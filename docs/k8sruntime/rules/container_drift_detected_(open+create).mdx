### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The Container Drift Detected (open+create) event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a container within a pod has modified or created a file outside of its designated file system.
- This event could be a potential security risk as it may indicate unauthorized access or tampering with the host system.
- To investigate this event, you can use the following commands:
  1. List all pods in the cluster: `kubectl get pods -A`
  2. Describe the specific pod where the event occurred: `kubectl describe pod <pod_name> -n <namespace>`
  3. Check the container logs for any suspicious activities: `kubectl logs <pod_name> -c <container_name> -n <namespace>`

#### Remediation

1. Identify the container that triggered the Container Drift Detected event by checking the details of the event. Use the following command to list all the events in the cluster:
   ```
   kubectl get events
   ```

2. Once you have identified the container, review the changes made to the container's file system. You can do this by comparing the current state of the container with a known good state. One way to achieve this is by using Kubernetes ConfigMaps or Secrets to store the expected file system state and then comparing it with the actual state of the container.

3. If any unauthorized changes are detected, take the following actions to remediate the issue:
   - Rollback the container to a previous version or redeploy it using a trusted image.
   - Investigate the root cause of the drift and address any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that may have allowed the unauthorized changes to occur.
   - Implement stricter security controls, such as using read-only file systems or implementing container image signing, to prevent future drift events.

Note: It is important to follow your organization's change management and incident response processes while remediating security issues.
