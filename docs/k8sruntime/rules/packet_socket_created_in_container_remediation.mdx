### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Packet socket created in container" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a container within a pod has created a packet socket. 
- A packet socket is a type of socket that allows direct access to network packets at the protocol level. It enables low-level network monitoring and manipulation within the container. 
- This event could be a potential security concern as it may indicate unauthorized network activity or attempts to bypass network policies. It is important to investigate the event further to ensure compliance with network security standards.

To investigate further, you can use the following kubectl command:
```
kubectl describe pod <pod_name> -n <namespace>
```
This command will provide detailed information about the pod, including the container that created the packet socket.

#### Remediation

Bash script:
1. Identify the container in which the packet socket was created using the event information.
2. Use the `docker exec` command to execute a bash script inside the container.
3. Inside the bash script, remove or disable the packet socket creation functionality.

Example bash script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Disable packet socket creation
sed -i 's/^\(.*packet_socket_create.*\)$/#\1/' /path/to/python_script.py
```

Python script:
1. Use the `kubectl exec` command to execute a Python script inside the container.
2. Inside the Python script, modify the code to remove or disable the packet socket creation functionality.
3. Save the modified Python script back to its original location.

Example Python script:
```python
import os

# Disable packet socket creation
os.system("sed -i 's/^\(.*packet_socket_create.*\)$/#\1/' /path/to/python_script.py")
```
