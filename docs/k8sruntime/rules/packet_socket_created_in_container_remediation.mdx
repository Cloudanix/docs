### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Packet socket created in container" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a container within a pod has created a packet socket. 
- A packet socket is a type of socket that allows direct access to network packets at the protocol level. It enables low-level network monitoring and manipulation within the container. 
- This event could be a potential security concern as it may indicate unauthorized network activity or attempts to bypass network policies. It is important to investigate the event further to ensure compliance with network security standards.

To investigate further, you can use the following kubectl command:
```
kubectl describe pod <pod_name> -n <namespace>
```
This command will provide detailed information about the pod, including the container that created the packet socket.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected container: Use the `kubectl get pods` command to list all the pods in the cluster. Look for the pod that generated the event. Note down the pod name.

2. Access the affected container: Use the `kubectl exec` command to access the shell of the affected container. For example, `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash`. This will open a shell session inside the container.

3. Disable packet socket creation: Edit the container's security context by modifying the pod's YAML file. Add the following securityContext section under the container spec:
```
securityContext:
  capabilities:
    add:
      - NET_RAW
      - NET_ADMIN
```
Save the changes and apply the updated YAML file using `kubectl apply -f <pod-yaml-file>`. This will disable packet socket creation in the container.

Note: Disabling packet socket creation may impact the functionality of certain applications that rely on raw network access. Ensure that this change aligns with your organization's compliance standards and security requirements.
