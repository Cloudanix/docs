### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The "Drop and execute new binary in container" event in a Kubernetes cluster indicates that a container within a pod has attempted to drop an existing binary and execute a new binary.
- This event could potentially indicate a malicious activity or unauthorized modification of the container's filesystem.
- To investigate this event, you can use the following kubectl command to view the logs of the affected pod: `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace>`. Additionally, you can inspect the container's filesystem using `kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -n <namespace> -- sh` to further analyze the changes made.

Remember to consider compliance standards and follow your organization's incident response procedures while investigating this event.

#### Remediation

1. Identify the affected container: Use the Kubernetes dashboard or the kubectl command `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>` to list all the pods in the namespace and identify the pod where the event occurred.

2. Isolate the affected container: Use the kubectl command `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n <namespace> -- sh` to access the shell of the affected container. Once inside the container, you can investigate the impact and gather more information about the event.

3. Remediate the issue:
   - Remove the malicious binary: Identify the new binary that was executed and remove it from the container using the appropriate command, such as `rm <binary-name>`.
   - Update container image: If the container image is compromised, update it to a secure version or rebuild it from a trusted source.
   - Implement security measures: Review and enhance the security measures in your Kubernetes cluster, such as applying RBAC policies, network policies, and pod security policies to prevent unauthorized access and execution of binaries.

Remember to follow your organization's compliance standards and best practices while remediating the issue.
