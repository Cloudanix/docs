title: "Container Security Onboarding"
---

## Overview:

The Cloudanix Container Security capability provides a dashboard to help you scan images for vulnerabilities, detect runtime threats and unusual behavior in your Kubernetes clusters. 

Examples of few the runtime threats detection rules:

- Files added or modified in sensitive directories
- SSH into a container
- Modifications to shell configuration files
- Attempts to read sensitive files that contain credential information
- Crypto mining

The Cloudanix dashboard provides an interactive interface that displays the mapping between threat events, associated workloads (container, pod, and node). Cloudanix also builds co-relation between Runtime Threats and Image Vulnerabilities

There are multiple capabilities offered as part of Container Security Product.

- Runtime Threat Detection
- Image Vulnerabilities Scanning at Build time

## Runtime Threat Detection **Installation:**

Runtime Threat Detection capability is offered as Helm Chart which sits next to the cluster workloads for deeper visibility & analysis into system level calls.

### **Pre-Requisites:**

1. Pick a cluster where you would like to install the container security capability.
2. Install Helm on your local machine, if it's not installed already, check “**Steps to Install Helm”** section for steps. Any version below 3.9.0 should be okay. 3.9.0 is known to raise invalid APIVersion errors while installation of helm charts. Reference: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/10975
3. For the Container Security integration, team member should be able to connect & install helm charts

    - Install Helm Chart
    - Click “Finish” once installation is completed

**Step 4:**

- Congratulations!
- Cloudanix Container Security capability is now installed.
- Data should start getting populated in the “Workloads” screen.

### Uninstall Steps

**Step 1:**

- Setup KubeConfig on your machine to point to your Cluster.

**Step 2:** 

- Uninstall helm chart

```bash
helm uninstall cloudanix -n cloudanix
```

**Step 3:** 

- Remove namespace

```bash
kubectl delete namespace cloudanix
```

## Image Vulnerabilities Scanning at Build time Installation:

Image Vulnerabilities Scanning at Build time integrates with CI/CD Pipelines. Once integrated, Cloudanix plugin exports vulnerabilities findings to Cloudanix. It’s used for visibility & also for co-relation with runtime workloads & threats in Cloudanix Dashboard.

Currently, following CI/CD Platforms are supported for integration:

- Github Actions
- GitLab
- Azure Devops

For integration, please reach out to support@cloudanix.com
