## Benefits of integrating PagerDuty with Cloudanix

* The Cloudanix integration alerts you for Security Incidents that could affect your Cloud infrastructure.
* PagerDuty ensures that the appropriate team is notified about findings like Malicious IP Activity and Brute Force Attacks. With intelligence from PagerDuty's alert grouping, reduce the noise with grouping similar alerts into a single issue.


## Requirements

Here are the pre-requisites for the integration:
* In PagerDuty, integration requires the following roles for configuration. Managers, Admins, Global Admins and Account Owners.
* In Cloudanix: Users with Admin Role. If you do not have this role, please reach out to an Admin for your Cloudanix Tenant.


## How it works

* This is a one-way integration from Cloudanix to PagerDuty. Cloudanix Event Findings (Threats, Anomalies or Malicious Activities) are sent to PagerDuty and those Findings create Incidents in PagerDuty Services.
