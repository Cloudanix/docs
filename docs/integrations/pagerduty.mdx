## Benefits of integrating PagerDuty with Cloudanix

Integrating PagerDuty with Cloudanix alerts will enable organizations to receive alerts instead of going
through all the alert mails thus reducing the overall workload.

## How it works

Cloudanix alerts that arise from anomaly, threat or misconfigurations send an event to a service in PagerDuty.

## Requirements

PagerDuty integrations require an Admin base role for account authorization. 
If you do not have this role, please reach out to an Admin or Account Owner within your organization to configure the integration

## Support 

If you need help with this integration, please contact support@cloudanix.com
