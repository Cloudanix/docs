## Resources which determine your pricing

GCP offers several services. Cloudanix monitors many of these services. However, we do not consider all of them to determine your Cloudanix pricing. Infact, we only use a subset of these services to generate your Cloudanix invoice.

The below table lists all the GCP services which makes up your Cloudanix invoice.

| Resource Name      | Unit         | Notes                         |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| GCP Compute Engine | Per instance |
| GCP CloudSql       | Per instance |                               |
| GCP BigTable       | Per instance |                               |
| GCP Storage        | Per bucket   |                               |
| GCP KMS            | Per instance |                               |
| GCP Functions      | Per function | No dependency on invocations. |

## How do we count your resources?

We continuously monitor the resources and record the max during the month. At the end of the month, your invoice will be generated accordingly.

## An example

Let's say you got 20 VMs, 50 Virtual function, 20 storage buckets and 4 database of PG. Then your pricing per month will be

(20+50+20+4) = 94 \* 0.99 (for Growth plan) = $93.06 per month

We simply add the count of these resources. It doesn't matter the number of your Functions invocations or the size of your VM servers. They are a single unit and gets added up in the count.

## Additional FAQ

There is an FAQ available on the [Pricing Page](https://www.cloudanix.com/pricing?ref=GCP-resources-for-pricing) which answer the popular pricing related questions. Below FAQ covers GCP specific queries.

### What about other resources like Networks, queues etc?

We monitor them but we do not use them towards your pricing. They are free.
