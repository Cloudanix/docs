- This event signifies that a user or application has created a new table in BigQuery, either by directly inserting it or by using an API call.
- The event provides information about the table, such as its name, schema, and location, allowing administrators to track and monitor changes to the BigQuery dataset.

#### Example

- Example: If the security is impacted with the `google.cloud.bigquery.v2.TableService.InsertTable` event in GCP Realtime for BigQuery, it could indicate a potential unauthorized attempt to create a new table in BigQuery. This event could be triggered by an attacker trying to gain access to sensitive data or perform malicious activities within the BigQuery environment.

- Remediation:
  1. Monitor and analyze the event logs: Continuously monitor the event logs for the `google.cloud.bigquery.v2.TableService.InsertTable` event in GCP Realtime. Use Cloud Monitoring or Cloud Logging to set up alerts and notifications for any suspicious activity related to table creation.
  
  2. Implement access controls and permissions: Ensure that proper access controls and permissions are in place for BigQuery. Limit the creation of tables to authorized users or roles. Use IAM policies to grant appropriate permissions and restrict access to sensitive data.
  
  3. Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for BigQuery to capture detailed information about table creation events. This will help in forensic analysis and investigation of any security incidents. Use the following command to enable audit logging for BigQuery:
  
     ```bash
     gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET_ID] --log-filter='protoPayload.methodName="google.cloud.bigquery.v2.TableService.InsertTable"'
     ```
     
     Replace `[SINK_NAME]`, `[PROJECT_ID]`, and `[DATASET_ID]` with appropriate values. This command creates a logging sink that exports logs matching the specified filter to a BigQuery dataset for further analysis.
