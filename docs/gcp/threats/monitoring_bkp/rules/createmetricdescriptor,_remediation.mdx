### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The google.monitoring.v3.MetricService.CreateMetricDescriptor event in GCP Realtime Monitoring refers to the creation of a new metric descriptor.
- A metric descriptor is a configuration object that defines the metadata for a custom metric in Google Cloud Monitoring.
- This event indicates that a user or application has created a new custom metric in GCP, which can be used to collect and analyze specific data points for monitoring purposes.

#### Example

Example of how security can be impacted with google.monitoring.v3.MetricService.CreateMetricDescriptor event in GCP Realtime Monitoring:

1. Unauthorized creation of custom metric descriptors: If an attacker gains access to the necessary permissions, they can use the `google.monitoring.v3.MetricService.CreateMetricDescriptor` event to create custom metric descriptors. This can lead to the creation of malicious or misleading metrics, which can impact the accuracy and reliability of monitoring data.

Remediation:
- Implement strict access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary permissions to create custom metric descriptors. Use IAM roles and permissions to limit access to trusted individuals or groups.
- Regularly review and audit metric descriptors: Monitor the creation of new metric descriptors and regularly review the existing ones. Implement a process to validate and approve any new metric descriptors before they are used in production.

2. Manipulation of metric data: An attacker with access to the `google.monitoring.v3.MetricService.CreateMetricDescriptor` event can potentially manipulate metric data by creating custom metric descriptors with misleading or incorrect configurations. This can lead to inaccurate monitoring data and impact the effectiveness of alerting and troubleshooting processes.

Remediation:
- Implement data validation and integrity checks: Regularly validate and verify the integrity of metric data. Implement mechanisms to detect and flag any anomalies or inconsistencies in the monitoring data.
- Monitor and alert on metric descriptor changes: Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to notify administrators whenever a new metric descriptor is created or modified. This can help identify any unauthorized changes and take appropriate actions.

3. Resource exhaustion: If an attacker repeatedly triggers the `google.monitoring.v3.MetricService.CreateMetricDescriptor` event with a large number of custom metric descriptors, it can lead to resource exhaustion and impact the performance and availability of the monitoring system.

Remediation:
- Implement rate limiting and throttling: Configure rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to limit the number of metric descriptor creations per unit of time. This can help prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
- Monitor resource utilization: Regularly monitor the resource utilization of the monitoring system, including CPU, memory, and storage. Set up alerts to notify administrators when resource usage exceeds predefined thresholds.

Note: The provided remediation steps are general recommendations and may need to be adapted based on the specific requirements and configurations of your GCP environment.
