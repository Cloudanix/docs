### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The google.monitoring.v3.UptimeCheckService.DeleteUptimeCheckConfig event in gcprealtime for Monitoring indicates that an Uptime Check configuration has been deleted.
- This event signifies that a specific Uptime Check configuration, which monitors the availability of a resource, has been removed from the Monitoring service in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- The event provides information about the Uptime Check configuration that was deleted, allowing administrators to track changes and maintain an audit trail of configuration modifications.

#### Example

- It is possible for the security to be impacted with the `google.monitoring.v3.UptimeCheckService.DeleteUptimeCheckConfig` event in GCP Realtime Monitoring if an unauthorized user gains access to the necessary permissions to delete an Uptime Check configuration.
- Remediation:
  1. Ensure that proper IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies are in place to restrict access to the Uptime Check configurations. Only authorized users should have the necessary permissions to delete or modify these configurations.
  2. Regularly review and audit the IAM policies to ensure that they are up to date and aligned with the principle of least privilege.
  3. Enable audit logging for the Uptime Check service to track any deletions or modifications made to the configurations. This can be done using the Cloud Logging service in GCP. For example, you can use the following command to create a log sink that exports logs related to Uptime Check configuration changes to Cloud Storage:

```bash
gcloud logging sinks create uptime-check-config-changes \
    storage.googleapis.com/[YOUR_BUCKET_NAME] \
    --log-filter='resource.type="uptimeCheckConfig"'
```

This will export the logs to the specified Cloud Storage bucket, allowing you to monitor and investigate any unauthorized deletions of Uptime Check configurations.
