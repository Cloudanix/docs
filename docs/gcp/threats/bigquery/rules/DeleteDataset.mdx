### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The google.cloud.bigquery.v2.DeleteDataset event in gcprealtime for BigQuery indicates that a dataset has been deleted in Google Cloud Platform's BigQuery service.
- This event signifies that all tables, views, and other objects within the dataset have been permanently removed.
- It is important to note that this event cannot be undone, and any data stored within the deleted dataset will be lost.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the Google Cloud project and triggers the `google.cloud.bigquery.v2.DeleteDataset` event in GCP Realtime for BigQuery, they can delete an entire dataset along with all its associated tables, views, and data. This can result in data loss, disruption of business operations, and potential violation of compliance regulations.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have access to the Google Cloud project and BigQuery resources. Use IAM roles and permissions to restrict access to sensitive operations like dataset deletion.
- Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for BigQuery to track and monitor all dataset deletion events. This will help in identifying any unauthorized or suspicious activities.
- Regular backups: Take regular backups of datasets and store them in a separate location or project. This will help in recovering the data in case of accidental or malicious deletion.

Example CLI command to enable audit logging for BigQuery:
```
gcloud logging sinks create <SINK_NAME> bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/datasets/<DATASET_ID> --log-filter='protoPayload.methodName="google.cloud.bigquery.v2.DatasetService.DeleteDataset"'
```

Example Bash script to create a backup of a dataset:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

PROJECT_ID="<PROJECT_ID>"
DATASET_ID="<DATASET_ID>"
BACKUP_BUCKET="<BACKUP_BUCKET>"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)

bq --project_id=$PROJECT_ID cp -r $PROJECT_ID:$DATASET_ID $BACKUP_BUCKET/$DATASET_ID-$TIMESTAMP
```

2. Example of security impact: If a misconfigured IAM role is assigned to a user or service account, granting them the `bigquery.datasets.delete` permission, they can trigger the `google.cloud.bigquery.v2.DeleteDataset` event and delete datasets without proper authorization. This can lead to unauthorized data deletion and potential data breaches.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and audit IAM roles: Regularly review and audit the IAM roles assigned to users and service accounts. Remove unnecessary or overly permissive roles to minimize the risk of unauthorized dataset deletion.
- Implement least privilege principle: Follow the principle of least privilege and only grant necessary permissions to users and service accounts. Avoid assigning the `bigquery.datasets.delete` permission unless absolutely required.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA for all user accounts to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access to the Google Cloud project.

Example CLI command to enable MFA for a user:
```
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Example Bash script to remove an IAM role from a user:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

PROJECT_ID="<PROJECT_ID>"
USER_EMAIL="<USER_EMAIL>"
ROLE="<ROLE>"

gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member=user:$USER_EMAIL --role=$ROLE
```

3. Example of security impact: If a malicious insider gains access to a privileged account with the necessary permissions to delete datasets, they can intentionally trigger the `google.cloud.bigquery.v2.DeleteDataset` event and delete critical datasets. This can result in significant data loss, disruption of business operations, and potential financial and reputational damage.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls and monitoring: Implement strict access controls for privileged accounts and regularly monitor their activities. Enable detailed logging and alerting to detect any suspicious or unauthorized dataset deletion events.
- Implement separation of duties: Implement separation of duties to ensure that no single individual has complete control over dataset deletion. Require multiple approvals or involvement of different individuals for critical operations.
- Regularly review and rotate credentials: Regularly review and rotate credentials for privileged accounts to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. Use strong password policies and consider implementing additional authentication factors.

Example CLI command to enable detailed logging for BigQuery:
```
gcloud logging sinks create <SINK_NAME> bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/datasets/<DATASET_ID> --log-filter='protoPayload.methodName="google.cloud.bigquery.v2.DatasetService.DeleteDataset"'
```

Example Bash script to rotate credentials for a service account:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

SERVICE_ACCOUNT="<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>"

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create --iam-account=$SERVICE_ACCOUNT key.json
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=key.json
```
