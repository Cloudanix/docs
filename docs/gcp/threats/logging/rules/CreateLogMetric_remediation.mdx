Remediation:
- Regularly review and monitor the logs and metrics in GCP to identify any unauthorized log metric creations.
- Implement proper access controls and permissions to restrict the creation of log metrics to authorized users only.
- Enable audit logging in GCP to track and investigate any unauthorized access attempts or log metric creations.

2. Bash script to list log metrics in GCP:
```bash
gcloud logging metrics list
```

3. Bash script to delete a specific log metric in GCP:
```bash
