### Event Information

- The google.logging.v2.ConfigServiceV2.DeleteSink event in GCP for Logging indicates that a sink has been deleted from the logging configuration.
- This event signifies that the configuration for sending logs to a specific destination, such as BigQuery or Cloud Storage, has been removed.
- It is important to monitor this event to track any changes made to the logging configuration and ensure that the appropriate sinks are in place for log management and analysis.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with google.logging.v2.ConfigServiceV2.DeleteSink in GCP for Logging, it could potentially allow unauthorized users or malicious actors to delete important log sinks. This could result in the loss of critical log data, hindering incident response and forensic investigations.

2. Data loss or exposure: If a log sink is deleted using google.logging.v2.ConfigServiceV2.DeleteSink without proper authorization or validation, it could lead to the accidental loss or exposure of sensitive log data. This can have serious implications for compliance with data protection regulations and may result in reputational damage for the organization.

3. Disruption of monitoring and auditing: Log sinks play a crucial role in monitoring and auditing activities within a cloud environment. If security is impacted with google.logging.v2.ConfigServiceV2.DeleteSink, it could disrupt the monitoring and auditing capabilities, making it difficult to detect and investigate security incidents or compliance violations. This can lead to delayed incident response and increased risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion of a log sink in GCP Logging using the GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Review and update IAM permissions:
   - Identify the IAM roles and permissions associated with the `google.logging.v2.ConfigServiceV2.DeleteSink` operation.
   - Ensure that only authorized individuals or service accounts have the necessary permissions to perform this operation.
   - Remove any unnecessary or excessive permissions that could potentially allow unauthorized deletion of log sinks.

2. Enable audit logging:
   - Enable audit logging for GCP Logging to track and monitor any changes made to log sinks.
   - Configure the audit logs to include information about the `google.logging.v2.ConfigServiceV2.DeleteSink` operation.
   - Regularly review the audit logs to detect any unauthorized deletion attempts and take appropriate actions.

3. Implement access controls:
   - Utilize GCP's Identity and Access Management (IAM) to enforce granular access controls for log sinks.
   - Assign appropriate IAM roles to individuals or service accounts based on their responsibilities and the need to manage log sinks.
   - Regularly review and update access controls to ensure that only authorized individuals have the necessary permissions to delete log sinks.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of log sinks in GCP Logging and ensure the integrity and availability of log data for security monitoring and compliance purposes.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate unauthorized deletion of a log sink in GCP Logging using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:
   - Identify the unauthorized deletion by reviewing the logs and audit trails.
   - Re-create the deleted log sink using the `gcloud logging sinks create` command, specifying the necessary parameters such as sink name, destination, and filter.
   - Ensure that proper access controls and permissions are in place to prevent unauthorized deletion in the future.

2. To mitigate the risk of data loss or exposure due to unauthorized deletion of log sinks in GCP Logging using GCP CLI, you can take the following actions:
   - Regularly monitor and review the logs and audit trails to detect any unauthorized deletion attempts.
   - Implement strong access controls and permissions to restrict the ability to delete log sinks.
   - Enable log sink deletion notifications to receive alerts when log sinks are deleted, allowing for immediate response and investigation.

3. To prevent disruption of logging infrastructure caused by unauthorized deletion of log sinks in GCP Logging using GCP CLI, consider the following measures:
   - Implement a backup and recovery strategy for log sinks to quickly restore them in case of accidental or unauthorized deletion.
   - Regularly test the backup and recovery process to ensure its effectiveness.
   - Implement strict access controls and permissions to limit the ability to delete log sinks to authorized individuals only.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of a log sink in GCP Logging using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized individuals or services have the necessary permissions to perform the `google.logging.v2.ConfigServiceV2.DeleteSink` operation. This can be achieved by using IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles and policies to restrict access to the log sink deletion functionality.

```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2

def delete_log_sink(project_id, sink_name):
    client = logging_v2.ConfigServiceV2Client()
    sink_path = client.sink_path(project_id, sink_name)
    client.delete_sink(sink_path)
```

2. Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for GCP Logging to track any changes made to log sinks. This will help in identifying unauthorized deletion attempts and provide an audit trail for investigation purposes.

```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2

def enable_audit_logging(project_id):
    client = logging_v2.ConfigServiceV2Client()
    project_path = client.project_path(project_id)
    client.update_project(project_path, audit_logs_enabled=True)
```

3. Monitor and alert on log sink deletions: Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and notify any unauthorized log sink deletions. This can be done by setting up Cloud Monitoring alerts or using Cloud Pub/Sub to receive notifications when log sinks are deleted.

```python
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3

def create_alert_policy(project_id, sink_name):
    client = monitoring_v3.AlertPolicyServiceClient()
    project_path = client.project_path(project_id)
    condition = monitoring_v3.AlertPolicy.Condition()
    condition.metric_threshold.filter = 'metric.type="logging.googleapis.com/sink/deleted_count"'
    condition.metric_threshold.threshold_value = 1
    condition.metric_threshold.comparison = monitoring_v3.ComparisonType.COMPARISON_GT
    condition.duration = {'seconds': 60}
    policy = monitoring_v3.AlertPolicy()
    policy.display_name = 'Log Sink Deletion Alert'
    policy.combiner = monitoring_v3.AlertPolicy.ConditionCombinerType.AND
    policy.conditions = [condition]
    client.create_alert_policy(project_path, policy)
```

By implementing these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized log sink deletions and ensure the integrity and availability of log data in GCP Logging.
