#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the google.pubsub.v1.Subscriber.CreateSubscription event in gcprealtime for Pubsub is misconfigured or misused, it can lead to potential security risks such as unauthorized access to sensitive data or unauthorized message consumption.

- Remediation: To mitigate the security impact, you can follow these steps:
  - Ensure that proper access controls are in place for Pubsub resources, such as topics and subscriptions. Limit access to only authorized users or service accounts.
  - Regularly review and audit the permissions assigned to Pubsub resources to identify any potential misconfigurations or excessive privileges.
  - Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information.
  - Enable Pubsub's Identity and Access Management (IAM) logging to monitor and detect any suspicious activities.
  - Regularly monitor and review the Pubsub logs and metrics to identify any abnormal behavior or potential security incidents.

Example CLI command for creating a Pubsub subscription with appropriate security measures:
```
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create <subscription-name> --topic=<topic-name> --ack-deadline=30 --expiration-period=259200 --message-retention-duration=604800 --push-endpoint=<endpoint-url> --push-auth-service-account=<service-account-email> --push-auth-token=<auth-token> --filter=<filter-expression>
```

2. Example of security impact: If the google.pubsub.v1.Subscriber.CreateSubscription event in gcprealtime for Pubsub is triggered by an unauthorized user or a malicious actor, it can result in the creation of a subscription that allows them to receive and access sensitive messages.

- Remediation: To address this security impact, consider the following steps:
  - Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as using service accounts or OAuth, to ensure that only authorized users or applications can create subscriptions.
  - Regularly review and monitor the Pubsub subscription creation events to detect any unauthorized or suspicious activities.
  - Enable Pubsub's access logs and audit logs to track and investigate any unauthorized subscription creations.
  - Implement strict access controls and permissions for Pubsub resources, ensuring that only necessary privileges are granted to users or service accounts.

Example CLI command for creating a Pubsub subscription with strict access controls:
```
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create <subscription-name> --topic=<topic-name> --ack-deadline=30 --expiration-period=259200 --message-retention-duration=604800 --filter=<filter-expression> --no-enable-message-ordering --no-enable-ack-ordering --no-retain-acked-messages
```

3. Example of security impact: If the google.pubsub.v1.Subscriber.CreateSubscription event in gcprealtime for Pubsub is triggered with weak or insecure configuration settings, it can expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access to messages.

- Remediation: To mitigate this security impact, consider the following actions:
  - Implement proper access controls and permissions for Pubsub resources, ensuring that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary privileges.
  - Enable Pubsub's encryption at rest and in transit to protect sensitive data.
  - Regularly review and update the subscription configuration settings to ensure they align with security best practices.
  - Implement Pubsub's Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to enforce fine-grained access controls.
  - Regularly monitor and analyze Pubsub logs and metrics to detect any abnormal activities or potential security vulnerabilities.

Example CLI command for creating a Pubsub subscription with secure configuration settings:
```
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create <subscription-name> --topic=<topic-name> --ack-deadline=30 --expiration-period=259200 --message-retention-duration=604800 --filter=<filter-expression> --enable-message-ordering --enable-ack-ordering --retain-acked-messages
```
