#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the google.bigtable.admin.v2.BigtableInstanceAdmin.SetIamPolicy event in gcprealtime for Bigtable, they could potentially modify the IAM policy for a Bigtable instance. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the Bigtable instance or unauthorized actions being performed on the instance.

Remediation:
- Regularly review and audit IAM policies for Bigtable instances to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions.
- Implement the principle of least privilege by granting only the minimum required permissions to users and service accounts.
- Enable Cloud Audit Logging to monitor and detect any unauthorized changes to IAM policies. For example, you can use the following gcloud command to enable Cloud Audit Logging for Bigtable instances:

```
gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME] \
    --log-filter='resource.type="bigtable.googleapis.com/Instance" protoPayload.methodName="google.bigtable.admin.v2.BigtableInstanceAdmin.SetIamPolicy"'
```

This command creates a Cloud Logging sink that exports logs for the `google.bigtable.admin.v2.BigtableInstanceAdmin.SetIamPolicy` method to a specified Cloud Storage bucket.

- Regularly review Cloud Audit Logging logs and set up alerts or notifications to promptly identify any unauthorized changes to IAM policies.
