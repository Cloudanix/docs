#### Using CLI

To remediate the issues mentioned in the previous response for GCP Pub/Sub using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Enable audit logging for Pub/Sub:
   - Use the following command to enable audit logging for Pub/Sub:
     ```
     gcloud pubsub topics set-iam-policy <TOPIC_NAME> policy.json
     ```
   - Replace `<TOPIC_NAME>` with the name of the Pub/Sub topic you want to enable audit logging for.
   - Create a `policy.json` file with the following content:
     ```
     {
       "auditConfigs": [
         {
           "auditLogConfigs": [
             {
               "logType": "DATA_READ",
               "exemptedMembers": []
             },
             {
               "logType": "DATA_WRITE",
               "exemptedMembers": []
             }
           ],
           "service": "pubsub.googleapis.com"
         }
       ],
       "bindings": [
         {
           "role": "roles/pubsub.publisher",
           "members": [
             "user:<USER_EMAIL>"
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Replace `<USER_EMAIL>` with the email address of the user who should have the `pubsub.publisher` role.

2. Implement VPC Service Controls for Pub/Sub:
   - Use the following command to create a VPC Service Controls perimeter for Pub/Sub:
     ```
     gcloud access-context-manager perimeters create <PERIMETER_NAME> --resources=pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/-/topics/*
     ```
   - Replace `<PERIMETER_NAME>` with a name for the perimeter and `<PROJECT_ID>` with your GCP project ID.

3. Enable Pub/Sub encryption at rest:
   - Use the following command to enable encryption at rest for Pub/Sub:
     ```
     gcloud pubsub topics update <TOPIC_NAME> --message-storage-policy-encryption-key=projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/global/keyRings/<KEY_RING_NAME>/cryptoKeys/<CRYPTO_KEY_NAME>
     ```
   - Replace `<TOPIC_NAME>` with the name of the Pub/Sub topic you want to enable encryption for, `<PROJECT_ID>` with your GCP project ID, `<KEY_RING_NAME>` with the name of the key ring, and `<CRYPTO_KEY_NAME>` with the name of the crypto key.

Please note that the above commands assume you have the necessary permissions to perform these actions in your GCP project.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issues mentioned in the previous response for GCP Pub/Sub using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Enable VPC Service Controls:
   - Use the `google-cloud-securitycenter` library to enable VPC Service Controls for your project.
   - Here's an example Python script to enable VPC Service Controls:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import securitycenter

   client = securitycenter.SecurityCenterClient()

   # Set the project ID and organization ID
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   organization_id = 'your-organization-id'

   # Set the VPC Service Controls configuration
   vpc_service_controls = {
       'project': f'projects/{project_id}',
       'servicePerimeters': [
           {
               'name': f'projects/{project_id}/servicePerimeters/default',
               'resources': [
                   'pubsub.googleapis.com'
               ],
               'status': 'ACTIVE'
           }
       ]
   }

   # Enable VPC Service Controls
   response = client.update_organization_settings(
       organization_id=organization_id,
       organization_settings={'vpc_service_controls': vpc_service_controls}
   )

   print('VPC Service Controls enabled successfully.')
   ```

2. Implement Pub/Sub access controls:
   - Use the `google-cloud-pubsub` library to implement access controls for your Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions.
   - Here's an example Python script to create a new topic with access controls:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

   publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()

   # Set the project ID and topic name
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   topic_name = 'your-topic-name'

   # Set the IAM policy for the topic
   policy = {
       'bindings': [
           {
               'role': 'roles/pubsub.publisher',
               'members': ['serviceAccount:your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com']
           }
       ]
   }

   # Create the topic with access controls
   topic_path = publisher.topic_path(project_id, topic_name)
   topic = publisher.create_topic(request={'name': topic_path, 'policy': policy})

   print(f'Topic {topic.name} created successfully with access controls.')
   ```

3. Monitor Pub/Sub activity using Cloud Monitoring:
   - Use the `google-cloud-monitoring` library to monitor Pub/Sub activity and set up alerts for any suspicious or unauthorized events.
   - Here's an example Python script to create a new alert policy for Pub/Sub:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import monitoring_v3

   client = monitoring_v3.AlertPolicyServiceClient()

   # Set the project ID and topic name
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   topic_name = 'your-topic-name'

   # Set the condition for the alert policy
   condition = {
       'condition_threshold': {
           'filter': f'resource.type="pubsub_topic" AND resource.labels.project_id="{project_id}" AND resource.labels.topic_id="{topic_name}"',
           'comparison': 'COMPARISON_GT',
           'threshold_value': 0,
           'duration': {'seconds': 60}
       }
   }

   # Create the alert policy
   policy = {
       'display_name': 'Pub/Sub Activity Alert',
       'conditions': [condition],
       'notification_channels': ['projects/your-project-id/notificationChannels/your-notification-channel']
   }

   # Create the alert policy
   response = client.create_alert_policy(
       name=f'projects/{project_id}', alert_policy=policy)

   print(f'Alert policy {response.name} created successfully.')
   ```

Please note that you need to replace the placeholders (`your-project-id`, `your-organization-id`, `your-service-account`, `your-topic-name`, `your-notification-channel`) with the actual values specific to your GCP environment.
