### Event Information

- The google.pubsub.v1.Subscriber.DeleteSubscription event in GCP for Pubsub indicates that a subscription has been deleted in the Google Cloud Pub/Sub service.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process initiates the deletion of a subscription.
- It signifies that the subscription and its associated resources, such as message delivery and acknowledgment, have been permanently removed from the Pub/Sub system.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with google.pubsub.v1.Subscriber.DeleteSubscription in GCP for Pubsub, one example could be an unauthorized user gaining access to the necessary permissions to delete a subscription. This could result in the accidental or intentional deletion of critical subscriptions, leading to data loss or disruption of message delivery.

2. Lack of access controls: Another example could be the absence of proper access controls for the DeleteSubscription operation. If there are no granular permissions in place, any user with the necessary Pubsub role or project-level IAM role could potentially delete subscriptions, even if they do not have a legitimate need to do so. This could lead to unauthorized or accidental deletions.

3. Insider threat: A third example could be an insider threat scenario where a trusted user with legitimate access to the DeleteSubscription operation misuses their privileges. This could involve deleting subscriptions without proper authorization or for malicious purposes, potentially causing data loss or disrupting critical business processes. Implementing proper monitoring and auditing mechanisms can help detect and mitigate such risks.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion, lack of access controls, and insider threats related to the google.pubsub.v1.Subscriber.DeleteSubscription operation in GCP Pubsub using the GCP console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Implement granular access controls:
   - Go to the GCP Console and navigate to the Pubsub section.
   - Select the project where your Pubsub subscriptions are located.
   - Click on the "IAM & Admin" tab in the left menu.
   - Identify the roles or permissions that grant access to the DeleteSubscription operation.
   - Review and modify the existing roles or create custom roles with more granular permissions.
   - Assign these roles to users or groups based on their specific needs and responsibilities.
   - Regularly review and update access controls to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.

2. Enable audit logging and monitoring:
   - In the GCP Console, navigate to the Pubsub section of your project.
   - Click on the "Logs" tab in the left menu.
   - Enable the necessary logs, such as Admin Activity or Data Access logs, to capture DeleteSubscription events.
   - Configure log sinks to export these logs to a centralized logging and monitoring system.
   - Set up alerts or notifications to be triggered when suspicious or unauthorized DeleteSubscription activities are detected.
   - Regularly review the logs and investigate any anomalies or suspicious activities promptly.

3. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA):
   - In the GCP Console, navigate to the "IAM & Admin" section of your project.
   - Click on the "IAM" tab in the left menu.
   - Identify the users or groups that have access to the DeleteSubscription operation.
   - Enable MFA for these users or groups to add an extra layer of security to their accounts.
   - Encourage the use of strong, unique passwords and regular password rotation.
   - Regularly review and revoke access for users who no longer require DeleteSubscription privileges.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized deletion, lack of access controls, and insider threats in GCP Pubsub using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of subscriptions in GCP Pubsub using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:
   - Regularly review and update access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete subscriptions. Use granular IAM roles and permissions to restrict access to the DeleteSubscription operation.
   - Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for Pubsub to track and monitor any deletion activities. This will help in identifying unauthorized deletions and taking appropriate actions.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for privileged accounts to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access to the GCP CLI.

2. Lack of access controls: To address the lack of access controls for the DeleteSubscription operation in GCP Pubsub using GCP CLI, you can take the following steps:
   - Implement least privilege principle: Assign the DeleteSubscription permission only to users or service accounts that require it for their legitimate tasks. Avoid granting this permission at the project or organization level.
   - Regularly review and update IAM policies: Periodically review and update IAM policies to ensure that access controls are aligned with the principle of least privilege. Remove unnecessary permissions from users or service accounts.
   - Conduct regular security assessments: Perform regular security assessments to identify any misconfigurations or gaps in access controls. Use tools like Cloud Security Command Center to gain visibility into your GCP environment.

3. Insider threat: To mitigate the risk of insider threats in GCP Pubsub using GCP CLI, consider the following measures:
   - Implement separation of duties: Implement a separation of duties policy to ensure that no single user has complete control over the DeleteSubscription operation. This helps prevent misuse of privileges by trusted users.
   - Enable activity monitoring and alerting: Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect any suspicious or unauthorized activities related to subscription deletions. Use Cloud Monitoring or Cloud Audit Logs to track and analyze user actions.
   - Conduct regular user access reviews: Regularly review and validate user access to the DeleteSubscription operation. Remove access for users who no longer require it or have changed roles within the organization.

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of subscriptions in GCP Pubsub using Python, you can implement the following steps:

- Regularly review and update access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete subscriptions. Use IAM roles and permissions to grant access to specific individuals or groups. Regularly review and update these access controls to remove any unnecessary or outdated permissions.

- Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for Pubsub operations, including subscription deletions. This will allow you to track and monitor any unauthorized deletion attempts. You can use the Cloud Audit Logs API in Python to retrieve and analyze the logs.

- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enforce the use of MFA for users with delete permissions. This adds an extra layer of security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

2. Lack of access controls: To address the lack of access controls for the DeleteSubscription operation in GCP Pubsub using Python, consider the following steps:

- Implement granular permissions: Define and assign granular permissions for the DeleteSubscription operation. Use IAM roles and custom roles to restrict access to only those users who require it. Avoid granting project-level IAM roles unless necessary.

- Regularly review and update permissions: Regularly review and update the permissions assigned to users. Remove any unnecessary or excessive permissions to minimize the risk of unauthorized deletions.

- Implement automated monitoring: Set up automated monitoring and alerting to detect any unusual or unauthorized deletion activities. You can use the Pubsub API in Python to retrieve subscription metadata and compare it against expected configurations.

3. Insider threat: To mitigate the risk of insider threats in GCP Pubsub using Python, consider the following measures:

- Implement least privilege principle: Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions. Only grant the DeleteSubscription permission to users who genuinely require it for their job responsibilities.

- Implement separation of duties: Implement separation of duties by dividing critical operations, such as subscription deletion, among multiple individuals or teams. This reduces the risk of a single insider having complete control over the deletion process.

- Implement monitoring and anomaly detection: Implement monitoring and anomaly detection mechanisms to identify any suspicious or unauthorized activities. Regularly review logs and audit trails to detect any unusual patterns or behavior. You can use the Pubsub API and Cloud Audit Logs API in Python to retrieve and analyze relevant logs.
