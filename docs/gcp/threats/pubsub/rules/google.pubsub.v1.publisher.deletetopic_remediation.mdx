### Event Information

1. The google.pubsub.v1.Publisher.DeleteTopic event in GCP for Pubsub indicates that a topic has been deleted by a publisher.
2. This event is triggered when a publisher sends a request to delete a specific topic in Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
3. It is important to note that deleting a topic will also delete all the associated subscriptions and any pending messages in those subscriptions.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: One potential security impact of using the `google.pubsub.v1.Publisher.DeleteTopic` operation in GCP Pub/Sub is the risk of unauthorized deletion of topics. If an attacker gains access to the necessary permissions or credentials, they could potentially delete critical topics, leading to data loss or disruption of services.

2. Data exposure: Another security concern is the potential exposure of sensitive data during the deletion process. If a topic contains confidential or personally identifiable information (PII), its deletion could inadvertently expose that data if proper precautions are not taken. It is important to ensure that any data stored in the topic is properly handled or removed before initiating the deletion.

3. Service disruption: Deleting a topic can have unintended consequences on the applications or services relying on it. If a topic is deleted without considering the impact on subscribers or downstream systems, it can lead to service disruptions or data inconsistencies. It is crucial to have a well-defined process in place to handle topic deletions, including proper communication and coordination with relevant stakeholders to minimize any potential disruptions.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion, data loss, and denial of service risks in GCP Pub/Sub using the GCP console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Implement Access Controls:
   - Go to the GCP Console and navigate to the Pub/Sub section.
   - Select the topic you want to secure and click on "Permissions" in the left-hand menu.
   - Review the existing permissions and ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary roles to delete topics.
   - Remove any unnecessary or overly permissive roles and grant the appropriate roles to the required users or service accounts.

2. Enable Backups and Recovery:
   - In the GCP Console, go to the Pub/Sub section and select the topic you want to protect.
   - Click on "Settings" in the left-hand menu.
   - Enable the "Message retention" option and set an appropriate retention period to retain messages even if the topic is accidentally deleted.
   - Consider enabling the "Snapshot" feature to create regular backups of the topic, allowing for easy recovery in case of data loss.

3. Set up Monitoring and Alerting:
   - Navigate to the GCP Console and go to the Pub/Sub section.
   - Select the topic you want to monitor and click on "Monitoring" in the left-hand menu.
   - Configure monitoring metrics and create alerts for any suspicious or unauthorized deletion attempts.
   - Set up notifications to be alerted via email, SMS, or other preferred channels when an alert is triggered.

By following these steps, you can enhance the security and resilience of your GCP Pub/Sub environment, mitigating the risks of unauthorized deletion, data loss, and denial of service attacks.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion in GCP Pub/Sub, you can use the following GCP CLI commands:

- Restrict access: Use the `gcloud pubsub topics add-iam-policy-binding` command to add IAM policies and restrict the necessary permissions for deleting topics. For example:
```
gcloud pubsub topics add-iam-policy-binding [TOPIC_NAME] --member=[MEMBER] --role=roles/pubsub.publisher
```
This command adds an IAM policy binding to the specified topic, granting the specified member the `roles/pubsub.publisher` role, which allows publishing messages but not deleting topics.

- Enable audit logging: Use the `gcloud logging sinks create` command to create a logging sink that captures logs for topic deletions. For example:
```
gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_NAME] --log-filter='protoPayload.methodName="google.pubsub.v1.Publisher.DeleteTopic"'
```
This command creates a logging sink that captures logs for the `google.pubsub.v1.Publisher.DeleteTopic` method, which is triggered when a topic is deleted. These logs can be used for monitoring and alerting purposes.

2. Data loss: To remediate data loss in GCP Pub/Sub, you can use the following GCP CLI commands:

- Enable backups: Use the `gcloud pubsub topics snapshots create` command to create snapshots of topics at regular intervals. For example:
```
gcloud pubsub topics snapshots create [TOPIC_NAME] --snapshot=[SNAPSHOT_NAME]
```
This command creates a snapshot of the specified topic, which can be used for recovery in case of accidental deletion or data loss.

- Implement retention policies: Use the `gcloud pubsub topics update` command to set a retention duration for topics. For example:
```
gcloud pubsub topics update [TOPIC_NAME] --message-retention-duration=[DURATION]
```
This command sets the message retention duration for the specified topic, ensuring that messages are retained for a specific period even if the topic is deleted. This helps prevent permanent data loss.

3. Denial of Service (DoS): To remediate DoS attacks in GCP Pub/Sub, you can use the following GCP CLI commands:

- Implement rate limiting: Use the `gcloud pubsub topics update` command to set a maximum publish rate for topics. For example:
```
gcloud pubsub topics update [TOPIC_NAME] --publish-throughput-bytes-per-second=[BYTES_PER_SECOND]
```
This command sets the maximum publish rate in bytes per second for the specified topic, limiting the impact of excessive deletion requests.

- Enable anomaly detection: Use the `gcloud monitoring policies create` command to create anomaly detection policies for Pub/Sub metrics. For example:
```
gcloud monitoring policies create [POLICY_NAME] --condition=[CONDITION] --notification-channels=[CHANNELS]
```
This command creates an anomaly detection policy based on specified conditions, such as abnormal deletion rates, and sends notifications to specified channels when anomalies are detected. This helps in detecting and responding to DoS attacks in a timely manner.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion, data loss, and denial of service risks in GCP Pub/Sub, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement Access Controls: Use IAM roles and permissions to restrict who can delete topics. Assign the necessary roles to authorized users and ensure that only trusted individuals have the necessary permissions to delete topics. Here's an example Python script to create a custom IAM role and assign it to a user:

```python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
from google.protobuf import field_mask_pb2

def create_custom_role(project_id, role_id, permissions):
    client = pubsub_v1.IAMPolicyClient()
    parent = f"projects/{project_id}"
    role = {
        "title": role_id,
        "description": "Custom role for Pub/Sub topic deletion",
        "includedPermissions": permissions,
    }
    response = client.create_role(parent, role)
    print(f"Custom role '{role_id}' created with ID: {response.name}")

# Usage example
project_id = "your-project-id"
role_id = "pubsub-topic-deleter"
permissions = ["pubsub.topics.delete"]
create_custom_role(project_id, role_id, permissions)
```

2. Backup and Recovery Mechanisms: Regularly backup your topics and ensure you have a disaster recovery plan in place. This can involve exporting topic configurations and messages to a storage service like Cloud Storage. Here's an example Python script to export a topic's messages to Cloud Storage:

```python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

def export_topic_messages(project_id, topic_id, bucket_name):
    client = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
    topic_path = client.topic_path(project_id, topic_id)
    storage_uri = f"gs://{bucket_name}/topic-backup"
    response = client.export_snapshot(topic_path, storage_uri)
    print(f"Messages from topic '{topic_id}' exported to: {response.name}")

# Usage example
project_id = "your-project-id"
topic_id = "your-topic-id"
bucket_name = "your-bucket-name"
export_topic_messages(project_id, topic_id, bucket_name)
```

3. Monitoring and Alerting: Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to any suspicious or unauthorized deletion attempts. Use Cloud Monitoring to create custom metrics and alerts based on Pub/Sub API activity. Here's an example Python script to create a Pub/Sub API metric and an alert policy:

```python
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3

def create_metric_and_alert(project_id, topic_id):
    client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient()
    project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
    metric_type = f"pubsub.googleapis.com/topic/{topic_id}/delete_count"
    metric_descriptor = {
        "type": metric_type,
        "metricKind": monitoring_v3.enums.MetricDescriptor.MetricKind.CUMULATIVE,
        "valueType": monitoring_v3.enums.MetricDescriptor.ValueType.INT64,
        "unit": "1",
        "description": "Number of topic deletions",
    }
    client.create_metric_descriptor(project_name, metric_descriptor)
    print(f"Metric '{metric_type}' created")

    alert_policy = {
        "displayName": f"Unauthorized topic deletion - {topic_id}",
        "combiner": monitoring_v3.enums.AlertPolicy.ConditionCombinerType.AND,
        "conditions": [
            {
                "conditionThreshold": {
                    "comparison": monitoring_v3.enums.ComparisonType.COMPARISON_GT,
                    "thresholdValue": 0,
                    "filter": f'metric.type="{metric_type}"',
                    "duration": {
                        "seconds": 300,
                    },
                },
            },
        ],
        "notificationChannels": [],
        "enabled": True,
    }
    response = client.create_alert_policy(project_name, alert_policy)
    print(f"Alert policy '{response.name}' created")

# Usage example
project_id = "your-project-id"
topic_id = "your-topic-id"
create_metric_and_alert(project_id, topic_id)
```

These scripts provide a starting point for implementing the necessary remediation steps in GCP Pub/Sub using Python. Remember to customize them according to your specific requirements and environment.
