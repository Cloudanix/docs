  2. Select the project and Firestore instance where the security issue is identified.
  3. Go to the "IAM & Admin" tab and click on "IAM" in the left-hand menu.
  4. Locate the role or user associated with the `google.firestore.admin.v1.FirestoreAdmin.UpdateDatabase` permission.
  5. Click on the pencil icon next to the role or user to edit their permissions.
  6. Remove the `google.firestore.admin.v1.FirestoreAdmin.UpdateDatabase` permission from the role or user.
  7. Save the changes.
  8. Regularly review and audit the IAM permissions to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary access to Firestore resources.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with `google.firestore.admin.v1.FirestoreAdmin.UpdateDatabase` in GCP Firestore, it means that an unauthorized user or process has gained the ability to modify the database configuration or schema, potentially leading to data loss or unauthorized access.

     ```
     gcloud firestore databases list
     ```

     gcloud firestore databases update [DATABASE_ID] --remove-permissions=google.firestore.admin.v1.FirestoreAdmin.UpdateDatabase:[USER_OR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]
     ```

  3. Monitor and review access controls: Regularly review and update the access controls for Firestore databases to ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary permissions.

Note: Replace `[DATABASE_ID]` with the actual ID of the impacted database, and `[USER_OR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]` with the email or service account ID of the unauthorized entity.
