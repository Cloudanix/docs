#### Example

- Impact on Security: The `google.firestore.admin.v1.FirestoreAdmin.DeleteIndex` event in GCP Realtime for Firestore can potentially impact security if it is triggered without proper authorization or authentication. This event is used to delete an index in Firestore, which can have significant implications on data access and query performance.

- Example: If an unauthorized user gains access to the GCP project and triggers the `DeleteIndex` event, they can delete critical indexes used for data retrieval and querying. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or cause performance issues for legitimate users.

- Remediation: To mitigate the security impact of this event, the following steps can be taken:
  1. Implement strict access controls and permissions for the GCP project, ensuring that only authorized users or services have the necessary privileges to trigger the `DeleteIndex` event.
  2. Enable audit logging and monitoring for Firestore events, including the `DeleteIndex` event. This will help in detecting any unauthorized or suspicious activities.
  3. Regularly backup Firestore indexes and data to ensure quick recovery in case of accidental or malicious deletion. This can be achieved using the Firestore export functionality:
     ```
     gcloud firestore export gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
     ```

Note: The specific implementation details may vary based on the GCP project setup and requirements. It is recommended to consult the official GCP documentation and security best practices for Firestore.
