### Event Information

- The google.monitoring.v3.UptimeCheckService.DeleteUptimeCheckConfig event in GCP for Monitoring indicates that an Uptime Check configuration has been deleted.
- This event signifies that a specific Uptime Check configuration, which monitors the availability of a resource, has been removed from the Monitoring service.
- It is important to note that this event does not indicate any issues with the resource being monitored, but rather the removal of the configuration itself.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with the `google.monitoring.v3.UptimeCheckService.DeleteUptimeCheckConfig` event in GCP Monitoring, it could indicate that an unauthorized user or entity has gained access to the system and is deleting uptime check configurations. This could potentially lead to service disruptions or false positives/negatives in monitoring alerts.

2. Misconfiguration: Another security impact could be due to misconfiguration of access controls or permissions. If the `DeleteUptimeCheckConfig` event is triggered by a user or service account with excessive privileges, it could result in unintended deletion of uptime check configurations, leading to potential gaps in monitoring coverage.

3. Malicious activity: The `DeleteUptimeCheckConfig` event could also indicate malicious activity, such as an attacker attempting to disrupt monitoring capabilities by deleting critical uptime check configurations. This could be part of a larger attack strategy aimed at evading detection or causing service disruptions.

To mitigate these security impacts, it is important to regularly review and update access controls and permissions, implement multi-factor authentication, monitor and analyze audit logs for suspicious activities, and ensure proper backup and recovery mechanisms are in place for uptime check configurations.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of uptime check configurations in GCP Monitoring using the GCP console, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Access the GCP console by navigating to the GCP Console URL (https://console.cloud.google.com) and logging in with appropriate credentials.

- Step 2: Navigate to the Monitoring section by selecting "Monitoring" from the main menu.

- Step 3: In the Monitoring section, locate and select "Uptime checks" from the left-hand menu.

- Step 4: Review the list of existing uptime check configurations and identify any deleted configurations.

- Step 5: If unauthorized deletion is detected, investigate the audit logs to determine the source of the deletion event. This can be done by selecting "Audit Logs" from the left-hand menu and filtering for the relevant event type (`google.monitoring.v3.UptimeCheckService.DeleteUptimeCheckConfig`).

- Step 6: Take appropriate action based on the investigation findings. This may include revoking access privileges for unauthorized users or entities, updating access controls and permissions, or implementing additional security measures such as multi-factor authentication.

- Step 7: Restore any deleted uptime check configurations from backups or recreate them as necessary.

2. Misconfiguration: To remediate misconfiguration-related security impacts in GCP Monitoring using the GCP console, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Access the GCP console and navigate to the Monitoring section as described in the previous response.

- Step 2: Review the access controls and permissions assigned to users and service accounts that have the ability to delete uptime check configurations.

- Step 3: Identify any users or service accounts with excessive privileges and adjust their access controls accordingly. This may involve removing unnecessary permissions or assigning more granular roles.

- Step 4: Regularly review and update access controls and permissions to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.

- Step 5: Consider implementing additional security measures such as IAM conditions or security policies to enforce stricter controls on uptime check configuration deletion.

3. Malicious activity: To remediate security impacts related to malicious activity in GCP Monitoring using the GCP console, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Access the GCP console and navigate to the Monitoring section as described earlier.

- Step 2: Review the audit logs for the `DeleteUptimeCheckConfig` event and investigate any suspicious activities or patterns.

- Step 3: If malicious activity is detected, take immediate action to mitigate the threat. This may involve revoking access privileges for the attacker, blocking their IP address, or escalating the incident to the appropriate security team.

- Step 4: Implement additional security measures such as intrusion detection systems, anomaly detection, or threat intelligence feeds to proactively identify and prevent future malicious activity.

- Step 5: Regularly monitor and analyze audit logs for any unusual or suspicious activities, and promptly investigate and respond to any potential security incidents.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unauthorized deletion, misconfiguration, and malicious activity related to the `DeleteUptimeCheckConfig` event in GCP Monitoring, you can take the following steps using GCP CLI:

1. Regularly review and update access controls and permissions:
   - Use the `gcloud projects get-iam-policy` command to retrieve the IAM policy for the project.
   - Analyze the policy to ensure that only authorized users and service accounts have the necessary permissions to delete uptime check configurations.
   - Use the `gcloud projects set-iam-policy` command to update the IAM policy and remove excessive privileges.

2. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA):
   - Enable MFA for all user accounts accessing the GCP project.
   - Use the `gcloud auth login` command to authenticate with MFA enabled.

3. Monitor and analyze audit logs:
   - Enable audit logging for GCP Monitoring API activities.
   - Use the `gcloud logging read` command to retrieve and analyze the audit logs.
   - Look for any suspicious activities related to the `DeleteUptimeCheckConfig` event and investigate further if necessary.

4. Ensure proper backup and recovery mechanisms:
   - Regularly backup uptime check configurations using the `gcloud monitoring uptime-checks describe` command to retrieve the configuration details.
   - Store the backup in a secure location, such as Cloud Storage or a version control system.
   - In case of accidental deletion or malicious activity, use the `gcloud monitoring uptime-checks create` command to recreate the uptime check configurations from the backup.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the security impacts of unauthorized deletion, misconfiguration, and malicious activity related to the `DeleteUptimeCheckConfig` event in GCP Monitoring.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion, misconfiguration, and malicious activity related to the `DeleteUptimeCheckConfig` event in GCP Monitoring, you can follow these steps:

1. Regularly review and update access controls and permissions:
   - Use the GCP IAM (Identity and Access Management) service to manage user and service account permissions.
   - Limit the number of users or service accounts with the ability to delete uptime check configurations.
   - Implement the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions to perform specific tasks.

2. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA):
   - Enable MFA for all user accounts accessing GCP resources, including those with permissions to delete uptime check configurations.
   - Use Google Authenticator or other MFA solutions supported by GCP.

3. Monitor and analyze audit logs:
   - Enable GCP Cloud Audit Logs to capture all API activity, including the `DeleteUptimeCheckConfig` event.
   - Use Cloud Logging or a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool to monitor and analyze the logs for any suspicious activities.
   - Set up alerts or notifications for any unexpected or unauthorized deletion events.

Here's an example Python script using the `google-cloud-logging` library to retrieve audit logs for the `DeleteUptimeCheckConfig` event:

```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2

def get_delete_uptime_check_config_logs(project_id):
    client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
    parent = f"projects/{project_id}"
    filter_str = 'protoPayload.methodName="google.monitoring.v3.UptimeCheckService.DeleteUptimeCheckConfig"'

    response = client.list_log_entries(
        request={"resourceNames": [parent], "filter": filter_str}
    )

    for entry in response:
        print(entry)

# Usage
project_id = "your-project-id"
get_delete_uptime_check_config_logs(project_id)
```

Note: Make sure to install the `google-cloud-logging` library using `pip install google-cloud-logging`.
