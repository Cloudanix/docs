- Enable Cloud Audit Logging and Monitoring: Enable Cloud Audit Logging to track and monitor all activity within the CloudRun service. Set up alerts and notifications to detect any suspicious or unauthorized activities.

Example CLI commands:
```
# Enable VPC Service Controls for CloudRun
gcloud services vpc-peerings connect \
    --service=servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
    --network=projects/[PROJECT_ID]/global/networks/[NETWORK_NAME] \
    --ranges=[IP_RANGE]

# Grant IAM roles to users/service accounts
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] \
    --member=[MEMBER] \
    --role=[ROLE]

# Enable Cloud Audit Logging
gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] \
    storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME] \
    --log-filter='resource.type="cloud_run_revision"'
```
