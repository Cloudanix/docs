### Event Information

- The google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure event in GCP for GCPIAM indicates a failed login attempt to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service using the GCPIAM (Google Cloud Platform Identity and Access Management) system.
- This event is triggered when a user or service account attempts to log in to a GCP service but fails due to incorrect credentials, insufficient permissions, or other authentication-related issues.
- The event provides valuable information for troubleshooting and security analysis, including the timestamp of the failed login attempt, the identity of the user or service account, and any relevant error codes or messages.


### Examples

1. Investigate potential brute force attacks: If you observe multiple instances of google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure events in GCP for GCPIAM, it could indicate that an attacker is attempting to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. In this case, you should investigate the source IP addresses associated with these events and implement measures to prevent brute force attacks, such as implementing account lockouts or rate limiting.

2. Review password policies and authentication mechanisms: The occurrence of google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure events may suggest that users are experiencing difficulties in logging in due to incorrect passwords or authentication issues. It is important to review and enforce strong password policies, including password complexity requirements and regular password expiration. Additionally, consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance the security of user accounts.

3. Monitor for account compromise: In some cases, google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure events may indicate that user accounts have been compromised. It is crucial to monitor for any suspicious activities associated with these events, such as unusual login patterns or access to sensitive resources. Implementing real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms can help detect and respond to potential account compromises promptly. Additionally, consider enabling audit logging and conducting regular security assessments to identify any vulnerabilities in your GCP environment.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Investigate potential brute force attacks:
- Access the GCP console and navigate to the Logging section.
- Filter the logs by selecting the appropriate log type, in this case, "google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure" events.
- Analyze the logs to identify the instances and source IP addresses associated with these events.
- Implement measures to prevent brute force attacks, such as implementing account lockouts or rate limiting, based on the analysis.

2. Review password policies and authentication mechanisms:
- Access the GCP console and navigate to the IAM & Admin section.
- Review the existing password policies and authentication mechanisms in place.
- Enforce strong password policies, including regular password changes and the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Communicate the updated policies to the users and provide guidance on how to set up MFA.

3. Monitor for account compromise:
- Access the GCP console and navigate to the Logging section.
- Filter the logs by selecting the appropriate log type, in this case, "google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure" events.
- Analyze the logs to identify any sudden increase in these events for GCPIAM.
- Investigate the affected accounts, reset passwords, and enable additional security measures like reviewing access logs, enabling suspicious activity alerts, and implementing anomaly detection mechanisms to identify and mitigate any ongoing attacks.

#### Using CLI

1. Investigate potential brute force attacks:
- Use the `gcloud logging read` command to retrieve the google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure events in GCP for GCPIAM: 
  ```
  gcloud logging read "resource.type=project AND logName=projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity AND protoPayload.methodName=google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure"
  ```
- Analyze the source IP addresses associated with these events to identify potential attackers.
- Implement measures to prevent brute force attacks, such as implementing account lockouts or rate limiting, using appropriate GCP services or configurations.

2. Review password policies and authentication mechanisms:
- Use the `gcloud iam policies describe` command to retrieve the IAM policies for GCPIAM:
  ```
  gcloud iam policies describe projects/[PROJECT_ID]/serviceAccounts/[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]
  ```
- Review the password policies and authentication mechanisms defined in the IAM policies.
- Enforce strong password policies, including regular password changes and the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA), by updating the IAM policies accordingly.

3. Monitor for account compromise:
- Use the `gcloud logging read` command to retrieve the google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure events in GCP for GCPIAM:
  ```
  gcloud logging read "resource.type=project AND logName=projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity AND protoPayload.methodName=google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure"
  ```
- Analyze the sudden increase in these events to identify potential compromised user accounts.
- Take immediate actions such as resetting passwords, reviewing access logs, enabling suspicious activity alerts, and implementing anomaly detection mechanisms using appropriate GCP services or configurations.

#### Using Python

1. Investigate potential brute force attacks:
To investigate potential brute force attacks in GCP GCPIAM using Python scripts, you can utilize the GCP Cloud Logging API. Here is an example Python script that retrieves and analyzes the google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure events:

```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2

def investigate_brute_force_attacks(project_id):
    client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
    parent = f"projects/{project_id}"
    filter_str = 'logName="projects/{project_id}/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity" AND protoPayload.methodName="google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure"'
    
    response = client.list_log_entries(request={"parent": parent, "filter": filter_str})
    
    for entry in response:
        source_ip = entry.proto_payload.request.metadata.caller_ip
        # Perform further analysis or actions based on the source IP
        
# Usage
project_id = "your-project-id"
investigate_brute_force_attacks(project_id)
```

2. Review password policies and authentication mechanisms:
To review password policies and authentication mechanisms in GCP GCPIAM using Python scripts, you can utilize the GCP Identity and Access Management (IAM) API. Here is an example Python script that retrieves and analyzes the google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure events:

```python
from google.cloud import iam_v1

def review_password_policies(project_id):
    client = iam_v1.IAMClient()
    parent = f"projects/{project_id}/locations/global"
    
    response = client.list_workload_identity_pools(request={"parent": parent})
    
    for pool in response:
        # Retrieve and analyze password policies and authentication mechanisms for each pool
        
# Usage
project_id = "your-project-id"
review_password_policies(project_id)
```

3. Monitor for account compromise:
To monitor for account compromise in GCP GCPIAM using Python scripts, you can utilize the GCP Cloud Monitoring API. Here is an example Python script that retrieves and analyzes the google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure events:

```python
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3

def monitor_account_compromise(project_id):
    client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient()
    project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
    filter_str = 'metric.type="logging.googleapis.com/user/login_failure_count" AND resource.type="gce_instance"'
    
    response = client.list_time_series(request={"name": project_name, "filter": filter_str})
    
    for series in response:
        # Analyze the time series data to identify sudden increases in login failure events
        
# Usage
project_id = "your-project-id"
monitor_account_compromise(project_id)
```
