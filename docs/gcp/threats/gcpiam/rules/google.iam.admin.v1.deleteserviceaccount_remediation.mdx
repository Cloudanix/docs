### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The google.iam.admin.v1.DeleteServiceAccount event in GCP for GCPIAM refers to the deletion of a service account in Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM).
- This event indicates that a service account, which is a special type of Google account used by applications and services to authenticate and access GCP resources, has been deleted.
- The event provides information about the service account that was deleted, including its unique identifier, email address, and the project in which it was created.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with google.iam.admin.v1.DeleteServiceAccount in GCP for GCPIAM, it means that an unauthorized user or process has the ability to delete service accounts in the GCP Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. This can lead to potential security breaches and unauthorized access to resources.

To remediate this issue for GCP GCPIAM using the GCP console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Identify the affected service account: 
   - Go to the GCP console and navigate to the IAM & Admin page.
   - Click on "Service accounts" in the left-hand menu.
   - Look for the service account that has the "google.iam.admin.v1.DeleteServiceAccount" permission assigned to it.

2. Remove the unauthorized permission:
   - Click on the service account name to open its details.
   - In the "Permissions" tab, locate the "google.iam.admin.v1.DeleteServiceAccount" permission.
   - Click on the trash bin icon next to the permission to remove it.

3. Review and adjust other permissions:
   - While in the service account details, review the other permissions assigned to the account.
   - Remove any unnecessary or unauthorized permissions.
   - Ensure that only authorized users or processes have the necessary permissions.

By following these steps, you can remediate the security impact of the "google.iam.admin.v1.DeleteServiceAccount" permission in GCP GCPIAM and mitigate the risk of unauthorized service account deletion.

#### Using CLI

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the `google.iam.admin.v1.DeleteServiceAccount` permission in GCP IAM, they can delete service accounts within the GCP project. This can lead to unauthorized access, data loss, and potential disruption of services relying on those service accounts.

2. Remediation steps for GCP GCPIAM using GCP CLI:
   - Identify the affected service account(s) by listing all service accounts in the project using the following command:
     ```
     gcloud iam service-accounts list --project [PROJECT_ID]
     ```

   - Remove the `google.iam.admin.v1.DeleteServiceAccount` permission from the unauthorized user or group by revoking their IAM role using the following command:
     ```
     gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=[MEMBER] --role=roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin
     ```

   - Regularly review and audit IAM permissions to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary privileges and permissions within the GCP project.

#### Using Python

Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the `google.iam.admin.v1.DeleteServiceAccount` permission in GCP for GCPIAM, they can delete service accounts within the project. This can lead to unauthorized access, data loss, and potential disruption of services.

Remediation steps for GCP GCPIAM using Python:
1. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Ensure that only authorized users have the `google.iam.admin.v1.DeleteServiceAccount` permission. Grant this permission only to trusted individuals or groups who require it for their specific tasks.
```python
from google.cloud import iam

def grant_delete_service_account_permission(project_id, member):
    client = iam.IAMClient()
    policy = client.get_policy(request={"resource": f"projects/{project_id}"})
    
    # Add the member to the IAM policy with the required permission
    policy.bindings.add(
        role="roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin",
        members=[member],
    )
    
    # Update the IAM policy
    client.set_policy(request={"resource": f"projects/{project_id}", "policy": policy})
```

2. Enable Audit Logging: Enable audit logging for IAM-related actions, including service account deletions. This will help in monitoring and detecting any unauthorized or suspicious activities.
```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2

def enable_iam_audit_logging(project_id):
    client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
    parent = client.project_path(project_id)
    
    # Create a sink to export IAM audit logs to Cloud Storage
    sink = {
        "name": f"projects/{project_id}/sinks/iam-audit-logs",
        "destination": f"storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME]",
        "filter": 'protoPayload.methodName="google.iam.admin.v1.DeleteServiceAccount"',
        "includeChildren": True,
    }
    
    # Create the sink
    client.create_sink(request={"parent": parent, "sink": sink})
```

3. Implement Continuous Monitoring: Regularly review the IAM audit logs and monitor for any suspicious or unauthorized service account deletions. Set up alerts or notifications to promptly respond to any security incidents.
```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2

def monitor_iam_audit_logs(project_id):
    client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
    parent = client.project_path(project_id)
    
    # List the IAM audit logs
    logs = client.list_logs(request={"parent": parent})
    
    # Process the logs and look for service account deletions
    for log in logs:
        if log.name == f"projects/{project_id}/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity":
            entries = client.list_log_entries(request={"resourceNames": [log.name]})
            for entry in entries:
                if entry.proto_payload.method_name == "google.iam.admin.v1.DeleteServiceAccount":
                    # Perform necessary actions for monitoring and incident response
                    pass
```
Note: Replace `[BUCKET_NAME]` with the actual name of the Cloud Storage bucket where you want to export the IAM audit logs.
