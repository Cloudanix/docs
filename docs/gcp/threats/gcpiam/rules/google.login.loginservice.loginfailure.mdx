### Event Information

- The google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure event in GCP for GCPIAM indicates a failed login attempt to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service using the GCPIAM (Google Cloud Platform Identity and Access Management) system.
- This event is triggered when a user or service account attempts to log in to a GCP service but fails due to incorrect credentials, insufficient permissions, or other authentication-related issues.
- The event provides valuable information for troubleshooting and security analysis, including the timestamp of the failed login attempt, the identity of the user or service account, and any relevant error codes or messages.


### Examples

1. Investigate potential brute force attacks: If you observe multiple instances of google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure events in GCP for GCPIAM, it could indicate that an attacker is attempting to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. In this case, you should investigate the source IP addresses associated with these events and implement measures to prevent brute force attacks, such as implementing account lockouts or rate limiting.

2. Review password policies and authentication mechanisms: The occurrence of google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure events may suggest that users are experiencing difficulties in logging in due to incorrect passwords or authentication issues. It is important to review and enforce strong password policies, including password complexity requirements and regular password expiration. Additionally, consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance the security of user accounts.

3. Monitor for account compromise: In some cases, google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure events may indicate that user accounts have been compromised. It is crucial to monitor for any suspicious activities associated with these events, such as unusual login patterns or access to sensitive resources. Implementing real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms can help detect and respond to potential account compromises promptly. Additionally, consider enabling audit logging and conducting regular security assessments to identify any vulnerabilities in your GCP environment.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the "Logging" section by clicking on the menu icon in the top-left corner and selecting "Logging" under the "Operations" section.
3. In the Logging section, you will see a search bar at the top. Click on it and enter the following filter query to search for the specific event: `resource.type="gce_instance" AND logName="projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity" AND protoPayload.methodName="google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure"`
   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual GCP project ID.
4. Press Enter or click on the "Search" button to execute the query.
5. The search results will display the event logs related to the specified filter query. Analyze the logs to identify patterns such as repeated login failures from the same IP address or multiple failed login attempts for different user accounts.
6. Based on your analysis, implement appropriate measures to remediate the identified issues, such as implementing account lockouts, rate limiting, resetting passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, or revoking compromised credentials.

Note: The steps provided assume that you have the necessary permissions and access to the GCP Console and Logging section.

#### Using CLI

1. Investigate potential brute force attacks:
- Use the GCP CLI command `gcloud logging read` to retrieve the event logs for google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure in GCP for GCPIAM.
- Analyze the logs to identify patterns such as repeated login failures from the same IP address or multiple failed login attempts for different user accounts.
- Implement measures like account lockouts or rate limiting using the GCP CLI command `gcloud identity-access-management` to mitigate the risk of brute force attacks.

2. Identify potential account compromise:
- Retrieve the event logs for google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure in GCP for GCPIAM using the GCP CLI command `gcloud logging read`.
- Analyze the logs to identify any suspicious login attempts, such as failed logins from unfamiliar IP addresses or unusual login patterns.
- Take appropriate actions, such as resetting passwords using the GCP CLI command `gcloud identity-access-management`, enabling multi-factor authentication, or revoking compromised credentials.

3. Monitor for credential stuffing attacks:
- Use the GCP CLI command `gcloud logging read` to retrieve the event logs for google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure in GCP for GCPIAM.
- Monitor for a significant increase in these events, which could indicate a credential stuffing attack.
- Implement measures like CAPTCHA, rate limiting, or a strong password policy using the GCP CLI command `gcloud identity-access-management` to mitigate the risk of credential stuffing attacks. Regularly monitor and analyze the event logs to identify any suspicious login patterns or unauthorized access attempts.

#### Using Python

1. Investigate potential brute force attacks:
- Use the GCP Cloud Logging API to retrieve the event logs for google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure events in GCPIAM.
- Analyze the logs using Python by filtering for specific patterns such as repeated login failures from the same IP address or multiple failed login attempts for different user accounts.
- Implement account lockouts or rate limiting using the GCP Identity and Access Management (IAM) API to mitigate the risk of brute force attacks.

2. Identify potential account compromise:
- Utilize the GCP Cloud Logging API to fetch the event logs for google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure events in GCPIAM.
- Write a Python script to analyze the logs and identify any suspicious login attempts, such as failed logins from unfamiliar IP addresses or unusual login patterns.
- Take appropriate actions like resetting passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, or revoking compromised credentials using the GCP IAM API.

3. Monitor for credential stuffing attacks:
- Retrieve the google.login.LoginService.LoginFailure event logs in GCPIAM using the GCP Cloud Logging API.
- Develop a Python script to monitor and analyze the logs, looking for a significant increase in login failure events.
- Implement measures like CAPTCHA, rate limiting, or a strong password policy using the GCP IAM API to mitigate the risk of credential stuffing attacks. Regularly monitor and analyze the event logs to identify any suspicious login patterns or unauthorized access attempts.
