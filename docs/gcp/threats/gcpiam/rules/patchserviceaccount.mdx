- Review the changes made to the service account's permissions or configuration.
- If the changes were unauthorized or unintended, revert the modifications to restore the original state of the service account.
- Regularly monitor and audit service account changes to detect and respond to any unauthorized modifications promptly.

Example CLI command to revert service account changes:
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts set-iam-policy [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] [ORIGINAL_POLICY_FILE]
```

- Review the changes made to the service account's roles or permissions.
- If the changes were unauthorized or excessive, revert the modifications to restore the original roles or permissions.

- Implement proper access controls and segregation of duties to prevent unauthorized modifications to service account roles and permissions.

Example CLI command to revert service account roles or permissions:
```bash
gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] --role=[ROLE]
```
