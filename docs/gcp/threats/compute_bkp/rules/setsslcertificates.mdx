### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setSslCertificates event in gcprealtime for Compute refers to an event where SSL certificates are being set for a target HTTPS proxy in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

2. This event indicates that a change is being made to the SSL certificates associated with a target HTTPS proxy, which is used to terminate SSL/TLS connections for HTTP(S) load balancing in GCP.

3. By setting SSL certificates for a target HTTPS proxy, you can ensure secure communication between clients and your backend services, protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of your applications.

#### Example

1. Impact on Security: The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setSslCertificates event in GCP Realtime for Compute can potentially impact security if unauthorized SSL certificates are set for the target HTTPS proxies. This can lead to potential man-in-the-middle attacks or unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Remediation:
- Regularly monitor and review the target HTTPS proxies and their associated SSL certificates to ensure they are valid and authorized.
- Implement strict access controls and permissions to prevent unauthorized modifications to the target HTTPS proxies.
- Use GCP Cloud Monitoring or other monitoring tools to set up alerts for any changes made to the SSL certificates associated with the target HTTPS proxies.

Example CLI Command:
To list the SSL certificates associated with a target HTTPS proxy in GCP, you can use the following gcloud command:

```
gcloud compute target-https-proxies describe [TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY_NAME] --project [PROJECT_ID] --format="json(sslCertificates)"
```

This command will provide a list of SSL certificates associated with the specified target HTTPS proxy. You can then review the certificates and ensure they are authorized and valid.

Note: Replace `[TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY_NAME]` with the actual name of the target HTTPS proxy and `[PROJECT_ID]` with your GCP project ID.
