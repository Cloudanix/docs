### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The dns.managedZones.delete event in gcprealtime for CloudDNS indicates that a managed zone has been deleted in Google Cloud DNS.
2. This event signifies that the DNS configuration for a specific domain or subdomain has been removed from Cloud DNS.
3. It is important to note that deleting a managed zone will result in the removal of all associated DNS records and configurations for that zone.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the credentials or privileges required to execute the `dns.managedZones.delete` event in GCP Realtime for CloudDNS, they could potentially delete a managed zone, leading to a loss of DNS records and disrupting the availability of services relying on those records. This could result in service downtime, potential data breaches, or even a complete loss of control over the affected domain.

Remediation:
- Implement strong access controls: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the necessary credentials and privileges required to execute the `dns.managedZones.delete` event. Use IAM roles and permissions to restrict access to trusted individuals or groups.
- Enable audit logging: Enable Cloud Audit Logging for CloudDNS to track and monitor any changes made to managed zones. This will help in identifying any unauthorized or suspicious activities.
- Regular backups: Take regular backups of your DNS records and configurations to mitigate the impact of accidental or malicious deletions. This will allow you to restore the DNS records in case of any unexpected deletions.

Example CLI command to enable audit logging for CloudDNS:
```
gcloud logging sinks create dns-audit-sink storage.googleapis.com/[YOUR_BUCKET_NAME] --log-filter="resource.type=cloud_dns_managed_zone"
```

Example CLI command to create a backup of a managed zone:
```
gcloud dns managed-zones export [ZONE_NAME] --destination-file=[BACKUP_FILE_PATH]
```

Note: Replace `[YOUR_BUCKET_NAME]` with the name of your Cloud Storage bucket and `[ZONE_NAME]` with the name of the managed zone you want to backup.
