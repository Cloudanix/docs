### Event Information

1. The dns.policies.delete event in GCP for CloudDNS indicates that a DNS policy has been deleted in the Cloud DNS service.
2. This event signifies that any DNS rules or configurations associated with the deleted policy will no longer be in effect.
3. It is important to monitor this event to ensure that the deletion of a DNS policy does not impact the DNS resolution and availability of your applications and services.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of DNS policies: If security is impacted with dns.policies.delete in GCP for CloudDNS, it could potentially lead to unauthorized deletion of DNS policies. This means that an attacker with sufficient privileges could delete critical DNS policies, disrupting the resolution of domain names and potentially causing service outages.

2. DNS hijacking: Another security impact could be DNS hijacking. If an unauthorized user gains access to delete DNS policies, they could potentially modify the DNS settings to redirect traffic to malicious servers. This could result in users being directed to fake websites or having their sensitive information intercepted.

3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: Deleting DNS policies inappropriately could also lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack. By deleting critical DNS policies, an attacker could disrupt the resolution of domain names, making it difficult for legitimate users to access services hosted on the affected domains. This could result in service downtime and financial losses for the affected organization.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion of DNS policies in GCP CloudDNS using the GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Ensure that proper access controls are in place to restrict the deletion of DNS policies to authorized individuals only. Grant the necessary permissions to specific users or groups who require the ability to manage DNS policies, while limiting access for others.

2. Enable Audit Logging: Enable audit logging for CloudDNS in GCP. This will allow you to track and monitor any changes made to DNS policies, including deletions. By reviewing the audit logs, you can identify any unauthorized deletion attempts and take appropriate action.

3. Regularly Backup DNS Policies: Create regular backups of your DNS policies to mitigate the risk of accidental or malicious deletions. This can be done by exporting the DNS policies configuration and storing it in a secure location. In the event of a deletion, you can restore the policies from the backup to quickly recover the configurations and minimize service disruption.

By implementing RBAC, enabling audit logging, and regularly backing up DNS policies, you can effectively remediate the risk of unauthorized deletion of DNS policies in GCP CloudDNS and ensure the availability and security of your DNS configurations.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate unauthorized deletion of DNS policies in GCP CloudDNS using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:
   - Identify the affected DNS policy by checking the audit logs or monitoring alerts.
   - Restore the deleted DNS policy from a backup or recreate it using the appropriate configuration.
   - Ensure that proper access controls and permissions are in place to prevent unauthorized deletion in the future.
   - Regularly monitor and review the audit logs to detect any suspicious activities related to DNS policy deletion.

2. To remediate DNS hijacking in GCP CloudDNS using GCP CLI, you can take the following actions:
   - Identify the compromised DNS policy by analyzing the DNS resolution logs or monitoring alerts.
   - Restore the original DNS configurations by reverting any unauthorized changes made by the attacker.
   - Implement additional security measures such as DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to prevent DNS hijacking.
   - Regularly monitor DNS resolution logs and traffic patterns to detect any abnormal behavior or unauthorized modifications.

3. To remediate service disruption caused by unauthorized deletion of DNS policies in GCP CloudDNS using GCP CLI, you can perform the following steps:
   - Identify the affected DNS policies by analyzing the audit logs or monitoring alerts.
   - Restore the deleted DNS policies from backups or recreate them with the correct configurations.
   - Implement proper access controls and permissions to prevent accidental or unauthorized deletion of DNS policies.
   - Regularly backup DNS policies and monitor for any unexpected changes or deletions to ensure service availability and reliability.

#### Using Python

1. To remediate unauthorized deletion of DNS policies in GCP CloudDNS, you can implement the following steps:

- Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete DNS policies. Use IAM (Identity and Access Management) to manage and assign appropriate roles to users, limiting the ability to delete DNS policies to trusted individuals.

- Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for CloudDNS to track any changes made to DNS policies. This will help in identifying any unauthorized deletion attempts and provide a trail for investigation.

- Regular backups: Take regular backups of DNS policies to ensure that even if a policy is accidentally deleted, it can be restored quickly. You can use the CloudDNS API in Python to automate the backup process and store the backups in a secure location.

2. To remediate DNS hijacking in GCP CloudDNS, consider the following steps:

- Enable DNSSEC: DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) adds an extra layer of security by digitally signing DNS records. Enabling DNSSEC ensures the integrity and authenticity of DNS responses, making it difficult for attackers to hijack DNS configurations.

- Implement strong access controls: Follow the principle of least privilege and ensure that only authorized users have the ability to modify DNS configurations. Regularly review and update access controls to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

- Monitor DNS traffic: Implement monitoring and anomaly detection mechanisms to identify any unusual DNS traffic patterns. This can help in detecting potential DNS hijacking attempts and taking appropriate actions to mitigate the risk.

3. To remediate service disruption caused by unauthorized deletion of DNS policies in GCP CloudDNS, you can take the following steps:

- Implement change management processes: Establish a formal change management process that includes proper authorization and documentation for any changes made to DNS policies. This ensures that only authorized changes are made and provides a clear understanding of the impact before any modifications are applied.

- Regularly review and validate DNS configurations: Conduct regular reviews of DNS configurations to ensure they align with the intended design and requirements. This helps in identifying any discrepancies or unauthorized changes and allows for timely remediation.

- Implement backup and restore procedures: Maintain regular backups of DNS policies and configurations. In the event of accidental deletion, having a backup allows for quick restoration of the policies, minimizing the impact on services. Use the CloudDNS API in Python to automate the backup and restore processes.
