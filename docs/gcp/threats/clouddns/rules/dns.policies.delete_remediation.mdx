### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The dns.policies.delete event in GCP for CloudDNS indicates that a DNS policy has been deleted in the Cloud DNS service.
2. This event signifies that any DNS rules or configurations associated with the deleted policy will no longer be in effect.
3. It is important to monitor this event to ensure that the deletion of a DNS policy does not impact the DNS resolution and availability of your applications and services.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with dns.policies.delete in GCP for CloudDNS, it means that an unauthorized user or process has the ability to delete DNS policies in the CloudDNS service. This can lead to potential disruptions in DNS resolution and compromise the availability and integrity of the DNS infrastructure.

- Remediation steps using GCP console:
  1. Identify and restrict access: Review the IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies for the CloudDNS service and ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary permissions to delete DNS policies. Remove any unnecessary or overly permissive access.
  2. Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for CloudDNS in GCP console. This will help in tracking and monitoring any deletion activities related to DNS policies. You can configure the logs to be stored in Cloud Storage or exported to BigQuery for further analysis.
  3. Implement least privilege: Follow the principle of least privilege and grant only the necessary permissions to users or service accounts. Use custom roles if needed to provide granular access control. Regularly review and update the permissions based on the principle of least privilege.

Note: It is important to regularly monitor and review the access controls and permissions for CloudDNS to ensure the security and integrity of the DNS infrastructure.

#### Using CLI

- Impact: The `dns.policies.delete` permission in GCP for CloudDNS allows a user to delete DNS policies, which can potentially impact the security of the CloudDNS configuration. If an unauthorized user gains access to this permission, they can delete important DNS policies, leading to service disruptions or unauthorized DNS changes.

- Example: If an attacker gains access to the `dns.policies.delete` permission, they can delete DNS policies that enforce security measures such as DNSSEC or DNS firewall rules. This can result in the compromise of DNS resolution, allowing the attacker to redirect traffic or perform DNS spoofing attacks.

- Remediation using GCP CLI: To remediate this security issue for GCP CloudDNS using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected user or service account with the `dns.policies.delete` permission.
   ```
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy [PROJECT_ID] --flatten="bindings[].members" --format="table(bindings.role)" --filter="bindings.members:[USER_EMAIL_OR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]"
   ```

2. Remove the `dns.policies.delete` permission from the user or service account.
   ```
   gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=[USER_EMAIL_OR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT] --role=roles/dns.policies.delete
   ```

3. Monitor and review the CloudDNS configuration regularly to ensure that the appropriate security policies are in place and that unauthorized changes are detected promptly.

Note: Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with the actual GCP project ID, and `[USER_EMAIL_OR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]` with the email address or service account identifier of the affected user.

#### Using Python

- Example: If security is impacted with `dns.policies.delete` in GCP for CloudDNS, it means that an unauthorized user or process has the ability to delete DNS policies, which can lead to disruption of DNS resolution and potential security vulnerabilities.

- Remediation steps for GCP CloudDNS using Python:
  1. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or processes have the necessary permissions to delete DNS policies. This can be achieved by using IAM roles and policies to restrict access to the `dns.policies.delete` permission.
  
  ```python
  from google.cloud import dns

  def delete_dns_policy(policy_name):
      client = dns.PoliciesClient()
      policy_path = client.policy_path(project_id, policy_name)
      client.delete_policy(policy_path)
  ```
  
  2. Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for CloudDNS to track any deletion activities related to DNS policies. This can help in identifying any unauthorized deletions and investigating security incidents.
  
  ```python
  from google.cloud import logging_v2

  def enable_dns_audit_logging(project_id):
      client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
      parent = client.project_path(project_id)
      log_name = "dns_audit_log"
      sink_name = "dns_audit_sink"
      filter_expr = 'protoPayload.methodName="dns.policies.delete"'
      
      sink = {
          "name": sink_name,
          "destination": f"bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/{project_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/tables/{table_id}",
          "filter": filter_expr,
          "output_version_format": "V2"
      }
      
      client.create_sink(parent, sink)
  ```
  
  3. Monitor and alert on policy deletions: Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to notify relevant stakeholders whenever a DNS policy is deleted. This can be achieved using Cloud Monitoring or other monitoring tools to set up alerts based on specific log entries or metrics related to policy deletions.
