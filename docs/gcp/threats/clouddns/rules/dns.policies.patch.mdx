### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The dns.policies.patch event in GCP for CloudDNS refers to a modification made to a DNS policy in Cloud DNS.
2. This event indicates that a change has been made to the configuration of a DNS policy, such as updating the rules or settings.
3. It is important to monitor this event as it helps track any changes made to DNS policies, ensuring that the policies are up to date and aligned with the desired configuration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example of security impact: If the dns.policies.patch permission is misconfigured in GCP for CloudDNS, it could allow unauthorized users to modify DNS policies, potentially leading to DNS hijacking or unauthorized DNS changes.

- Remediation steps using GCP console:
  1. Log in to the GCP console and navigate to the Cloud DNS page.
  2. Select the DNS policy that needs to be remediated.
  3. Click on the "Permissions" tab.
  4. Review the existing permissions and identify any instances where the dns.policies.patch permission is granted to unauthorized users or roles.
  5. Remove the dns.policies.patch permission from any unauthorized users or roles by clicking on the "Edit" button next to the respective user or role.
  6. Save the changes and ensure that only authorized users or roles have the dns.policies.patch permission.
  7. Regularly review and audit the permissions to ensure ongoing security and compliance.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with `dns.policies.patch` in GCP for CloudDNS, it could potentially allow unauthorized modifications to DNS policies, leading to DNS hijacking or unauthorized DNS changes.

- Remediation for GCP CloudDNS using GCP CLI:
  1. Identify the affected DNS policy by listing all DNS policies in the project:
     ```
     gcloud dns policies list --project [PROJECT_ID]
     ```

  2. Review the policy details to understand the impact and identify the necessary changes:
     ```
     gcloud dns policies describe [POLICY_NAME] --project [PROJECT_ID]
     ```

  3. Update the affected DNS policy to remediate the security issue. For example, if the issue is related to unauthorized modifications, you can restrict the policy to only allow modifications from authorized sources:
     ```
     gcloud dns policies update [POLICY_NAME] --project [PROJECT_ID] --update-dnssec-state=on --update-allow-dns-requests-from=[AUTHORIZED_SOURCES]
     ```
     Replace `[POLICY_NAME]` with the name of the affected DNS policy, `[PROJECT_ID]` with your GCP project ID, and `[AUTHORIZED_SOURCES]` with the authorized sources (e.g., IP ranges, service accounts) that are allowed to modify the DNS policy.

Note: The actual commands may vary based on your specific requirements and the GCP CLI version you are using. Make sure to refer to the official GCP documentation for the most up-to-date commands and options.

#### Using Python

- Example of security impact: If the `dns.policies.patch` permission is misconfigured or granted to unauthorized users in GCP for CloudDNS, it could allow them to modify DNS policies, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in DNS configurations. This could result in DNS hijacking, DNS spoofing, or other malicious activities.

- Remediation steps for GCP CloudDNS using Python:
  1. Identify and review the IAM roles and permissions associated with the `dns.policies.patch` permission.
  2. Ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary permissions to modify DNS policies.
  3. Implement a least privilege principle by granting the `dns.policies.patch` permission only to specific individuals or service accounts that require it, and regularly review and audit the access controls.

Python script example to grant `dns.policies.patch` permission to a service account:

```python
from google.cloud import iam

def grant_dns_policies_patch_permission(service_account_email):
    client = iam.IAMClient()
    policy = client.get_policy(request={"resource": "projects/your-project-id"})
    
    # Add dns.policies.patch permission to the service account
    policy.bindings.add(
        role="roles/dns.policies.patch",
        members=[f"serviceAccount:{service_account_email}"]
    )
    
    # Update the policy
    client.set_policy(request={"resource": "projects/your-project-id", "policy": policy})
```

Note: Replace `your-project-id` with your actual GCP project ID and provide the `service_account_email` as an argument to the `grant_dns_policies_patch_permission` function.
