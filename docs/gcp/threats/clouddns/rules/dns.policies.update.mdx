### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The dns.policies.update event in GCP for CloudDNS refers to a change or update made to a DNS policy within the Cloud DNS service.
2. This event indicates that a modification has been made to the configuration or settings of a DNS policy, which governs how DNS queries are handled and resolved.
3. It is important to monitor and track dns.policies.update events to ensure that any changes to DNS policies are intentional and align with the desired DNS resolution behavior for the associated domains or resources.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with dns.policies.update in GCP for CloudDNS, it could potentially allow unauthorized users to modify DNS policies, leading to DNS hijacking or other malicious activities. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive information or disruption of services.

- Remediation steps using GCP console:
  1. Sign in to the Google Cloud Console.
  2. Navigate to the Cloud DNS page.
  3. Select the DNS policy that needs to be secured.
  4. Click on the "Permissions" tab.
  5. Review the existing permissions and identify any users or groups with the dns.policies.update role.
  6. Remove the dns.policies.update role from any unauthorized users or groups.
  7. Click on the "Add Member" button to grant the dns.policies.update role to authorized users or groups.
  8. Specify the email address or group name of the authorized user or group.
  9. Select the dns.policies.update role from the dropdown menu.
  10. Click on the "Add" button to grant the role.
  11. Repeat steps 8-10 for each authorized user or group.
  12. Review the updated permissions to ensure only authorized users or groups have the dns.policies.update role.
  13. Save the changes.
  14. Regularly monitor and review the permissions to ensure ongoing security and compliance.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with `dns.policies.update` in GCP for CloudDNS, it could potentially allow unauthorized users to modify DNS policies, leading to DNS hijacking or other malicious activities.

- Remediation steps for GCP CloudDNS using GCP CLI:
  1. Identify the impacted DNS policy by listing all the existing policies:
     ```
     gcloud dns policies list
     ```

  2. Disable the `dns.policies.update` permission for unauthorized users or service accounts by updating the IAM policy for the specific DNS policy:
     ```
     gcloud dns policies update [POLICY_NAME] --remove-iam-policy-binding [ROLE]:[UNAUTHORIZED_USER]
     ```

  3. Verify the updated IAM policy to ensure the `dns.policies.update` permission is removed for unauthorized users:
     ```
     gcloud dns policies describe [POLICY_NAME] --format="json(iamPolicy)"
     ```

Note: Replace `[POLICY_NAME]` with the actual name of the DNS policy, `[ROLE]` with the desired IAM role (e.g., `roles/dns.admin`), and `[UNAUTHORIZED_USER]` with the email or service account of the unauthorized user.

#### Using Python

- Example: If security is impacted with `dns.policies.update` in GCP for CloudDNS, it could potentially allow unauthorized users to modify DNS policies, leading to DNS hijacking or unauthorized DNS changes.

- Remediation steps for GCP CloudDNS using Python:
  1. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary permissions to update DNS policies. Use IAM roles and permissions to restrict access to the `dns.policies.update` action.
  2. Enable audit logging: Enable Cloud Audit Logs for CloudDNS to track any changes made to DNS policies. This will help in identifying any unauthorized modifications and take appropriate actions.
  3. Implement continuous monitoring: Regularly monitor the Cloud Audit Logs and set up alerts or notifications to detect any suspicious activities related to DNS policy updates. This can be achieved using Cloud Monitoring or by leveraging the Cloud Logging API.

Python script example to update DNS policies in GCP CloudDNS:

```python
from google.cloud import dns

def update_dns_policy(project_id, policy_name, new_description):
    client = dns.PoliciesClient()
    policy_path = client.policy_path(project_id, policy_name)
    policy = client.get_policy(policy_path)
    policy.description = new_description
    update_mask = {"paths": ["description"]}
    updated_policy = client.update_policy(policy, update_mask)
    print(f"DNS policy {policy_name} updated successfully.")

# Usage example
project_id = "your-project-id"
policy_name = "your-policy-name"
new_description = "New policy description"
update_dns_policy(project_id, policy_name, new_description)
```

Note: This script assumes that you have already set up authentication for your Python environment using Application Default Credentials (ADC) or explicitly providing service account credentials.
