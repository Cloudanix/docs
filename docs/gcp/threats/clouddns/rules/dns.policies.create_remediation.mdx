### Event Information

1. The dns.policies.create event in GCP for CloudDNS indicates that a new DNS policy has been created in the Cloud DNS service.
2. This event signifies that a user or an automated process has defined a new policy to control how DNS queries are handled within the Cloud DNS infrastructure.
3. The dns.policies.create event is important for tracking and auditing purposes, as it allows administrators to monitor the creation of DNS policies and ensure that the desired DNS configurations are being implemented.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized creation of DNS policies: If security is impacted with dns.policies.create in GCP for CloudDNS, it could potentially allow unauthorized users to create DNS policies. This can lead to the creation of malicious policies that can redirect traffic to unauthorized or malicious destinations, compromising the security of the network.

2. DNS hijacking: Another security impact could be DNS hijacking. If an attacker gains access to the dns.policies.create permission, they can create policies that redirect DNS queries to their own malicious servers. This can result in users being directed to fake websites or having their sensitive information intercepted.

3. DNS cache poisoning: The creation of unauthorized DNS policies can also lead to DNS cache poisoning. By manipulating DNS responses, attackers can redirect legitimate traffic to malicious destinations. This can result in users unknowingly accessing fake websites or being exposed to phishing attacks, compromising their security and privacy.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized creation of DNS policies in GCP CloudDNS using the GCP console, you can follow these steps:

1. Limit IAM permissions: Review and update the IAM (Identity and Access Management) permissions for users and service accounts. Ensure that only authorized individuals or roles have the necessary permissions to create DNS policies. Remove any unnecessary or overly permissive roles.

2. Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for CloudDNS in GCP. This will allow you to monitor and track any changes made to DNS policies. By reviewing the audit logs regularly, you can identify any unauthorized creation of DNS policies and take appropriate action.

3. Implement firewall rules: Configure firewall rules to restrict access to the CloudDNS API. Only allow trusted IP addresses or networks to access the API. This will help prevent unauthorized users from creating DNS policies.

Additionally, it is recommended to regularly review and monitor the DNS policies in CloudDNS to identify any suspicious or unauthorized changes. Implementing a robust change management process and conducting regular security assessments can also help mitigate the risk of unauthorized creation of DNS policies.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unauthorized creation of DNS policies in GCP CloudDNS, you can follow these steps using GCP CLI commands:

1. Restrict IAM permissions: Review and modify the IAM permissions to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary roles and permissions to create DNS policies. Remove any unnecessary or overly permissive roles assigned to users or service accounts.

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=[MEMBER] --role=[ROLE]
```

2. Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for CloudDNS to track any changes made to DNS policies. This will help in identifying unauthorized creation of policies and provide an audit trail for investigation.

```bash
gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME] --log-filter="resource.type=project AND logName:cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity AND protoPayload.methodName:google.cloud.dns.v1.Policies.CreatePolicy"
```

3. Implement VPC Service Controls: Configure VPC Service Controls to restrict access to CloudDNS APIs from unauthorized networks or IP ranges. This adds an additional layer of security by preventing unauthorized access to the DNS infrastructure.

```bash
gcloud beta services vpc-peerings create [PEERING_NAME] --network=[NETWORK_NAME] --ranges=[IP_RANGE] --service=[SERVICE_NAME]
```

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized creation of DNS policies in GCP CloudDNS and enhance the security of your DNS infrastructure.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized creation of DNS policies in GCP CloudDNS, you can take the following steps:

1. Implement IAM (Identity and Access Management) controls: Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to create DNS policies. Use IAM roles and permissions to restrict access to the Cloud DNS service and prevent unauthorized creation of policies.

2. Enable audit logging and monitoring: Enable Cloud Audit Logging to track and monitor any changes made to DNS policies. This will help in identifying any unauthorized creation of policies and take appropriate actions. Additionally, set up alerts or notifications to be notified of any suspicious activities related to DNS policies.

3. Regularly review and delete unused policies: Periodically review the existing DNS policies and delete any unused or unnecessary policies. This will help in reducing the attack surface and minimizing the risk of unauthorized policy creation.

Here's an example of a Python script that can be used to automate the remediation process:

```python
from google.cloud import dns

def delete_unused_policies(project_id, zone_name):
    client = dns.Client(project=project_id)
    zone = client.zone(zone_name)

    # Get all DNS policies in the zone
    policies = zone.list_policies()

    for policy in policies:
        # Check if the policy is unused
        if policy.num_managed_zones == 0:
            # Delete the unused policy
            policy.delete()

    print("Unused DNS policies deleted successfully.")

# Usage
project_id = "your-project-id"
zone_name = "your-zone-name"

delete_unused_policies(project_id, zone_name)
```

Note: Replace "your-project-id" with your actual GCP project ID and "your-zone-name" with the name of the DNS zone where you want to delete unused policies. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to delete DNS policies in the specified zone.
