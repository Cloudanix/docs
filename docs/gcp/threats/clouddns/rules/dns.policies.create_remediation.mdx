### Event Information

1. The dns.policies.create event in GCP for CloudDNS indicates that a new DNS policy has been created in the Cloud DNS service.
2. This event signifies that a user or an automated process has defined a new policy to control how DNS queries are handled within the Cloud DNS service.
3. The dns.policies.create event is important for tracking and auditing purposes, as it allows administrators to monitor the creation of DNS policies and ensure that the desired DNS configurations are being implemented.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized creation of DNS policies: If security is impacted with dns.policies.create in GCP for CloudDNS, it could potentially allow unauthorized users to create DNS policies. This can lead to the creation of malicious policies that can redirect traffic to unauthorized or malicious destinations, compromising the security of the network.

2. DNS hijacking: Another security impact could be DNS hijacking. If an attacker gains access to the dns.policies.create permission, they can create policies that redirect DNS queries to their own malicious servers. This can result in users being directed to fake websites or having their sensitive information intercepted.

3. DNS cache poisoning: The creation of unauthorized DNS policies can also lead to DNS cache poisoning. By manipulating DNS responses, attackers can redirect legitimate traffic to malicious destinations. This can result in users unknowingly accessing fake websites or being exposed to phishing attacks, compromising their security and privacy.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized creation of DNS policies can be remediated by following these steps in the GCP console:
   - Identify and review the IAM roles and permissions assigned to users and service accounts.
   - Remove the dns.policies.create permission from any unauthorized users or service accounts.
   - Regularly review and audit IAM roles and permissions to ensure they are aligned with the principle of least privilege.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts to add an extra layer of security.

2. To mitigate the risk of DNS hijacking in GCP CloudDNS, you can take the following steps:
   - Enable DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) for your DNS zones to ensure the integrity and authenticity of DNS responses.
   - Regularly monitor DNS traffic and analyze DNS query logs for any suspicious activity.
   - Implement DNS firewall rules to block or alert on any unauthorized DNS queries or responses.
   - Regularly review and update DNS policies to ensure they are aligned with your organization's security requirements.

3. To prevent DNS cache poisoning in GCP CloudDNS, you can implement the following measures:
   - Enable DNS response rate limiting to protect against DNS amplification attacks and reduce the impact of cache poisoning.
   - Implement DNS query logging and analysis to detect any abnormal DNS responses or patterns.
   - Regularly update and patch DNS servers to mitigate any known vulnerabilities.
   - Implement DNSSEC to ensure the authenticity and integrity of DNS responses and prevent cache poisoning attacks.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate unauthorized creation of DNS policies in GCP CloudDNS, you can follow these steps using GCP CLI:

- Identify the unauthorized DNS policies by reviewing the existing policies and their creators.
- Revoke the dns.policies.create permission from unauthorized users or roles using the following command:
  `gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=[MEMBER] --role=roles/dns.policies.create`

2. To mitigate the risk of DNS hijacking, you can take the following actions using GCP CLI:

- Monitor for any suspicious DNS policies or changes in DNS configurations.
- Regularly review and audit the DNS policies and their associated resources.
- Implement DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to add an additional layer of security to DNS queries.

3. To prevent DNS cache poisoning resulting from unauthorized DNS policies, you can perform the following steps using GCP CLI:

- Regularly review and validate the DNS cache to ensure its integrity.
- Implement DNS response rate limiting (RRL) to mitigate the impact of cache poisoning attacks.
- Enable DNS logging and monitoring to detect any unusual DNS activities and take appropriate actions.

#### Using Python

1. To remediate unauthorized creation of DNS policies in GCP CloudDNS, you can implement the following steps using Python:

```python
from google.cloud import dns

def remove_dns_policy(project_id, policy_name):
    client = dns.Client(project=project_id)
    policy = client.get_policy(policy_name)
    policy.delete()
    print(f"DNS policy {policy_name} has been successfully deleted.")

# Usage example
project_id = "your-project-id"
policy_name = "unauthorized-policy"
remove_dns_policy(project_id, policy_name)
```

2. To mitigate the risk of DNS hijacking in GCP CloudDNS, you can implement the following steps using Python:

```python
from google.cloud import dns

def disable_dns_policy(project_id, policy_name):
    client = dns.Client(project=project_id)
    policy = client.get_policy(policy_name)
    policy.update(enable=False)
    policy.changes.create()
    print(f"DNS policy {policy_name} has been disabled to prevent DNS hijacking.")

# Usage example
project_id = "your-project-id"
policy_name = "hijacked-policy"
disable_dns_policy(project_id, policy_name)
```

3. To prevent DNS cache poisoning resulting from unauthorized DNS policies in GCP CloudDNS, you can implement the following steps using Python:

```python
from google.cloud import dns

def remove_dns_policy(project_id, policy_name):
    client = dns.Client(project=project_id)
    policy = client.get_policy(policy_name)
    policy.delete()
    print(f"DNS policy {policy_name} has been successfully deleted.")

# Usage example
project_id = "your-project-id"
policy_name = "unauthorized-policy"
remove_dns_policy(project_id, policy_name)
```

Please note that the provided Python scripts assume you have the necessary permissions and have installed the `google-cloud-dns` library. Adjust the code as per your specific requirements and environment.
