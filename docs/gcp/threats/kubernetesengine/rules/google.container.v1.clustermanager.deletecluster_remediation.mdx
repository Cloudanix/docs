### Event Information

- The google.container.v1.ClusterManager.DeleteCluster event in GCP for Kubernetes Engine indicates that a cluster deletion operation has been initiated.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process requests to delete a Kubernetes Engine cluster in GCP.
- The event signifies the start of the cluster deletion process and provides information about the cluster being deleted, such as the project ID, cluster name, and zone.




### Examples

1. Unauthorized access: If security is impacted with the `google.container.v1.ClusterManager.DeleteCluster` event in GCP for Kubernetes Engine, it could indicate that an unauthorized user or entity has gained access to the cluster management API and is attempting to delete a cluster. This could potentially lead to the deletion of critical resources and disruption of services.

2. Misconfiguration: Another possible security impact could be due to misconfiguration of access controls or permissions within the Kubernetes Engine cluster. If the event is triggered by a user or service account with excessive privileges, it could result in unintended deletion of clusters, leading to data loss or service downtime.

3. Malicious activity: The event could also indicate malicious activity, such as an attacker attempting to delete a cluster as part of a larger attack or data breach. This could be a result of compromised credentials or an insider threat. It is important to investigate such events promptly to identify and mitigate any potential security risks.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized access:
- Step 1: Access the GCP console and navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section.
- Step 2: Select the specific cluster that triggered the `google.container.v1.ClusterManager.DeleteCluster` event.
- Step 3: Review the cluster's access controls and permissions to identify any potential unauthorized users or entities.
- Step 4: Remove any unauthorized access by revoking the corresponding user or entity's permissions or disabling their accounts.
- Step 5: Monitor the cluster for any further unauthorized access attempts and consider implementing additional security measures, such as enabling audit logging or enabling VPC Service Controls.

2. Misconfiguration:
- Step 1: Access the GCP console and navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section.
- Step 2: Select the specific cluster that triggered the event.
- Step 3: Review the cluster's access controls and permissions to identify any misconfigurations.
- Step 4: Adjust the access controls and permissions to ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary privileges.
- Step 5: Regularly review and audit the cluster's access controls to prevent future misconfigurations.

3. Malicious activity:
- Step 1: Access the GCP console and navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section.
- Step 2: Select the specific cluster that triggered the event.
- Step 3: Investigate the event logs and any associated logs or monitoring data to identify any signs of malicious activity.
- Step 4: If compromised credentials are suspected, revoke the affected credentials and enforce stronger authentication measures, such as multi-factor authentication.
- Step 5: Implement additional security measures, such as network policies or intrusion detection systems, to detect and prevent future malicious activity. Regularly monitor and analyze logs and events to identify any potential security threats.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized access: To remediate unauthorized access to the GCP Kubernetes Engine cluster, you can take the following steps using GCP CLI commands:

- Identify the user or service account responsible for the unauthorized access by reviewing the logs and audit trails. Use the following command to list the events related to cluster deletion:

  `gcloud logging read "resource.type=container AND protoPayload.methodName=google.container.v1.ClusterManager.DeleteCluster"`

- Disable or revoke the compromised credentials or access keys associated with the unauthorized user or service account. Use the appropriate GCP CLI command to disable or revoke the credentials, depending on the type of credentials used.

- Implement strong access controls and permissions within the Kubernetes Engine cluster. Ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary privileges to perform cluster deletion operations. Use the `gcloud` command to manage access controls and permissions.

2. Misconfiguration: To remediate misconfiguration issues related to access controls or permissions within the Kubernetes Engine cluster, you can follow these steps using GCP CLI commands:

- Review the current access controls and permissions configuration of the cluster using the following command:

  `gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE]`

- Identify any excessive privileges granted to users or service accounts. Adjust the permissions accordingly to limit the scope of actions they can perform within the cluster. Use the `gcloud` command to modify access controls and permissions.

- Regularly audit and review the access controls and permissions configuration to ensure that they align with the principle of least privilege. Implement a process to periodically review and update the configuration as needed.

3. Malicious activity: To remediate malicious activity related to the deletion of a GCP Kubernetes Engine cluster, you can take the following steps using GCP CLI commands:

- Investigate the event promptly by reviewing the logs and audit trails. Use the following command to list the events related to cluster deletion:

  `gcloud logging read "resource.type=container AND protoPayload.methodName=google.container.v1.ClusterManager.DeleteCluster"`

- Identify any suspicious or unauthorized activities associated with the event. Look for indicators of compromise or unauthorized access.

- Take appropriate actions based on the investigation findings. This may include disabling compromised credentials, revoking access, restoring the cluster from backups, and implementing additional security measures to prevent future incidents.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized access, misconfiguration, or malicious activity in GCP Kubernetes Engine, you can use Python scripts to implement the following steps:

1. Monitor and detect unauthorized access:
   - Use the Google Cloud Monitoring API to set up alerts for the `google.container.v1.ClusterManager.DeleteCluster` event.
   - Write a Python script that periodically checks for this event using the Monitoring API and sends notifications or triggers automated actions when unauthorized access is detected.
   - Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), for all user and service accounts accessing the Kubernetes Engine cluster.

2. Prevent misconfiguration:
   - Use the Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) API to review and manage access controls and permissions for the Kubernetes Engine cluster.
   - Write a Python script that regularly audits the IAM policies and identifies any misconfigurations, such as excessive privileges or incorrect role assignments.
   - Implement a least privilege principle by granting only the necessary permissions to users and service accounts.

3. Detect and respond to malicious activity:
   - Utilize the Google Cloud Security Command Center API to monitor and analyze security events and logs related to the Kubernetes Engine cluster.
   - Write a Python script that analyzes the logs for suspicious patterns or anomalies, such as multiple failed authentication attempts or unusual API calls.
   - Implement a robust incident response plan that includes steps for investigating and mitigating potential security breaches, such as revoking compromised credentials and restoring affected resources.

Please note that the provided steps are high-level guidelines, and you may need to adapt them based on your specific requirements and environment.
