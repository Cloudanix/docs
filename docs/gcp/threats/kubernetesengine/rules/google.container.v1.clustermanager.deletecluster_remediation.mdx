### Event Information

- The google.container.v1.ClusterManager.DeleteCluster event in GCP for Kubernetes Engine indicates that a cluster deletion operation has been initiated.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process requests to delete a Kubernetes Engine cluster in GCP.
- The event provides information about the cluster being deleted, such as the project ID, cluster name, and the user who initiated the deletion.




### Examples

1. Unauthorized access: If security is impacted with the `google.container.v1.ClusterManager.DeleteCluster` event in GCP for Kubernetes Engine, it could indicate that an unauthorized user or entity has gained access to the cluster management API and is attempting to delete a cluster. This could potentially lead to the deletion of critical resources and disruption of services.

2. Misconfiguration: Another possibility is that the event is triggered due to a misconfiguration in the access control settings of the Kubernetes Engine cluster. If the necessary permissions are not properly configured, it could allow unauthorized users or entities to delete clusters, leading to a security breach.

3. Malicious activity: The event could also indicate malicious activity, such as an attacker attempting to delete a cluster as part of a larger attack or data breach. This could be a deliberate attempt to disrupt services, steal sensitive data, or gain unauthorized access to other resources within the cluster or the broader GCP environment.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Unauthorized access:
- Step 1: Access the GCP console and navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section.
- Step 2: Select the specific cluster that triggered the `google.container.v1.ClusterManager.DeleteCluster` event.
- Step 3: Review the cluster's access controls and permissions to identify any potential unauthorized users or entities.
- Step 4: Remove any unauthorized access by revoking the corresponding user or entity's permissions or disabling their accounts.
- Step 5: Monitor the cluster for any further unauthorized access attempts and consider implementing additional security measures, such as enabling audit logging or enabling VPC Service Controls.

2. Misconfiguration:
- Step 1: Access the GCP console and navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section.
- Step 2: Select the specific cluster that triggered the event.
- Step 3: Review the cluster's access controls and permissions to identify any misconfigurations.
- Step 4: Adjust the access controls and permissions to ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary privileges.
- Step 5: Regularly review and audit the cluster's access controls to prevent future misconfigurations.

3. Malicious activity:
- Step 1: Access the GCP console and navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section.
- Step 2: Select the specific cluster that triggered the event.
- Step 3: Investigate the event logs and any associated logs or monitoring data to identify any signs of malicious activity.
- Step 4: If compromised credentials are suspected, revoke the affected credentials and enforce stronger authentication measures, such as multi-factor authentication.
- Step 5: Implement additional security measures, such as network policies or intrusion detection systems, to detect and prevent future malicious activity. Regularly monitor and analyze logs and events to identify any potential security threats.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized access: To remediate unauthorized access to the GCP Kubernetes Engine cluster, you can take the following steps using the GCP CLI:

- Identify the user or service account associated with the `google.container.v1.ClusterManager.DeleteCluster` event by reviewing the event logs or audit logs.
- Disable or revoke the access privileges of the unauthorized user or service account using the `gcloud` command with the appropriate IAM role or permission modifications.
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access in the future.

2. Misconfiguration: To remediate misconfiguration issues in the GCP Kubernetes Engine cluster, you can use the GCP CLI as follows:

- Review the cluster configuration using the `gcloud container clusters describe` command to identify any misconfigured access controls or permissions.
- Adjust the access controls and permissions using the `gcloud container clusters update` command to ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary privileges.
- Regularly audit and validate the cluster configuration to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.

3. Malicious activity: To remediate malicious activity in the GCP Kubernetes Engine cluster, you can follow these steps using the GCP CLI:

- Investigate the `google.container.v1.ClusterManager.DeleteCluster` event by reviewing the event logs or audit logs to gather additional information about the activity.
- Disable or revoke the compromised credentials or access privileges associated with the event using the `gcloud` command with the appropriate IAM role or permission modifications.
- Implement security measures such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), log monitoring, and anomaly detection to detect and prevent future malicious activities.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized access, misconfiguration, or malicious activity in GCP Kubernetes Engine, you can use the following Python script:

1. Unauthorized access:
```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2

def remediate_unauthorized_access(project_id, cluster_name):
    client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
    filter_str = f'resource.type="k8s_cluster" AND protoPayload.methodName="google.container.v1.ClusterManager.DeleteCluster" AND resource.labels.cluster_name="{cluster_name}"'
    response = client.list_log_entries(project_id, filter_=filter_str)
    
    for entry in response:
        # Perform necessary actions to revoke access and secure the cluster
        # For example, you can disable the compromised user account or service account
        # You can also review and update access controls and permissions for the cluster
        # Additionally, consider enabling audit logging and monitoring for future incidents
```

2. Misconfiguration:
```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2

def remediate_misconfiguration(project_id, cluster_name):
    client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
    filter_str = f'resource.type="k8s_cluster" AND protoPayload.methodName="google.container.v1.ClusterManager.DeleteCluster" AND resource.labels.cluster_name="{cluster_name}"'
    response = client.list_log_entries(project_id, filter_=filter_str)
    
    for entry in response:
        # Review and update access controls and permissions for the cluster
        # Ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have necessary privileges
        # Regularly audit and monitor access controls to prevent misconfigurations
        # Consider implementing least privilege principle to minimize potential impact
```

3. Malicious activity:
```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2

def remediate_malicious_activity(project_id, cluster_name):
    client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
    filter_str = f'resource.type="k8s_cluster" AND protoPayload.methodName="google.container.v1.ClusterManager.DeleteCluster" AND resource.labels.cluster_name="{cluster_name}"'
    response = client.list_log_entries(project_id, filter_=filter_str)
    
    for entry in response:
        # Investigate the event to identify the source and nature of the malicious activity
        # Take appropriate actions to mitigate the attack, such as revoking compromised credentials
        # Implement additional security measures like multi-factor authentication and intrusion detection systems
        # Regularly monitor and analyze logs to detect and respond to potential security incidents
```

Note: The provided Python scripts use the Google Cloud Logging API to retrieve relevant log entries based on the specified filters. You need to have the necessary permissions and authentication set up to use the API.
