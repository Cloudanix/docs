      - Select the cluster where the issue is occurring.
      - Click on the "Security" tab to view the security settings of the cluster.
      - Check the access controls and authentication mechanisms in place for the Kubernetes API.
      - Update the access controls to ensure that only authorized users or services have access to the Kubernetes API.
      - Enable authentication mechanisms like RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) or OIDC (OpenID Connect) to secure the API access.
      - Monitor the cluster to ensure that unauthorized access to the Kubernetes API is prevented.

   c. Example 3: Misconfigured network policies
      - Navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section in the GCP console.
      - Select the cluster where the issue is occurring.
      - Click on the "Networking" tab to view the network settings of the cluster.
      - Check the network policies configured for the cluster and identify any misconfigurations.
      - Update the network policies to ensure that the desired traffic flow and access controls are in place.
      - Test the network policies to verify that the desired traffic is allowed and unauthorized traffic is blocked.
      - Monitor the cluster to ensure that the network policies are correctly configured and enforced.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issues in GCP Kubernetes Engine using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Enable Kubernetes Engine Pod Security Policies:
   - Use the following command to enable the PodSecurityPolicy feature:
     ```
     gcloud beta container clusters update [CLUSTER_NAME] --enable-pod-security-policy
     ```

2. Implement Network Policies:
   - Install the Calico network policy controller by running the following command:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml
     ```
   - Create a network policy to restrict traffic between pods by defining the desired ingress and egress rules. For example:
     ```
     apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
     kind: NetworkPolicy
     metadata:
       name: [NETWORK_POLICY_NAME]
     spec:
       podSelector:
         matchLabels:
           app: [APP_LABEL]
       policyTypes:
       - Ingress
       - Egress
       ingress:
       - from:
         - podSelector:
             matchLabels:
               app: [ALLOWED_APP_LABEL]
         ports:
         - protocol: TCP
           port: [ALLOWED_PORT]
       egress:
       - to:
         - podSelector:
             matchLabels:
               app: [ALLOWED_APP_LABEL]
         ports:
         - protocol: TCP
           port: [ALLOWED_PORT]
     ```
     Apply the network policy using the command:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f [NETWORK_POLICY_FILE]
     ```

3. Implement Pod Security Policies:
   - Create a Pod Security Policy (PSP) manifest file with the desired security settings. For example:
     ```
     apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
     kind: PodSecurityPolicy
     metadata:
       name: [PSP_NAME]
     spec:
       privileged: false
       allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
       requiredDropCapabilities:
       - ALL
       allowedCapabilities: []
       volumes:
       - 'configMap'
       - 'emptyDir'
       - 'projected'
       - 'secret'
       hostNetwork: false
       hostIPC: false
       hostPID: false
       runAsUser:
         rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot'
       seLinux:
         rule: 'RunAsAny'
       supplementalGroups:
         rule: 'MustRunAs'
       fsGroup:
         rule: 'MustRunAs'
     ```
     Apply the PSP using the command:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f [PSP_FILE]
     ```
   - Create a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding to allow the PSP to be used by the desired service accounts. For example:
     ```
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     kind: ClusterRole
     metadata:
       name: [CLUSTER_ROLE_NAME]
     rules:
     - apiGroups: ['policy']
       resources: ['podsecuritypolicies']
       verbs: ['use']
       resourceNames: ['[PSP_NAME]']
     ---
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     kind: ClusterRoleBinding
     metadata:
       name: [CLUSTER_ROLE_BINDING_NAME]
     roleRef:
       apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
       kind: ClusterRole
       name: [CLUSTER_ROLE_NAME]
     subjects:
     - kind: ServiceAccount
       name: [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME]
       namespace: [NAMESPACE]
     ```
     Apply the ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding using the command:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f [CLUSTER_ROLE_FILE]
     ```

   - Set the necessary parameters such as cluster name, zone, node pool details, and any additional settings required.
   - Execute the script to create the cluster.

2. Configuring Pod Security Policies:
   - Use the `google-cloud-sdk` library to manage Pod Security Policies (PSPs) in GCP Kubernetes Engine.
   - Write a Python script that utilizes the `google.cloud.container_v1` module to create or update PSPs.
   - Define the desired PSP configurations, such as allowed security contexts, volumes, and other restrictions.
   - Execute the script to apply the PSPs to the Kubernetes Engine cluster.

3. Implementing Network Policies:
   - Use the `google-cloud-sdk` library to manage network policies in GCP Kubernetes Engine.
   - Write a Python script that utilizes the `google.cloud.container_v1` module to create or update network policies.
   - Define the desired network policy rules, such as ingress and egress rules, allowed protocols, and source/destination IP ranges.
   - Execute the script to apply the network policies to the Kubernetes Engine cluster.
