### Event Information

- The v1.compute.sslPolicies.delete event in GCP for Compute indicates that an SSL policy has been deleted.
- This event signifies that any existing SSL policy configurations associated with the specified resource (such as a load balancer) will no longer be in effect.
- It is important to review the impact of this event on your environment and ensure that any necessary SSL configurations are updated or replaced accordingly.


### Examples

1. Loss of SSL/TLS encryption: Deleting the SSL policy for Compute Engine instances in GCP can impact security by removing the SSL/TLS encryption configuration. This means that the communication between clients and the instances will no longer be encrypted, potentially exposing sensitive data to eavesdropping or interception.

2. Increased vulnerability to attacks: SSL policies provide a layer of protection against common security vulnerabilities, such as SSL/TLS protocol weaknesses or outdated cipher suites. Deleting the SSL policy can leave the instances vulnerable to attacks that exploit these weaknesses, increasing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

3. Non-compliance with security standards: Many compliance standards, such as PCI DSS or HIPAA, require the use of SSL/TLS encryption for data in transit. Deleting the SSL policy can result in non-compliance with these standards, potentially leading to penalties or loss of certification. It is important to carefully assess the impact on compliance before deleting SSL policies in GCP.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
2. Navigate to the Compute Engine section by clicking on the "Compute Engine" option in the left-hand menu.
3. In the Compute Engine section, click on "VM instances" to view a list of your virtual machine instances.
4. Locate the instance for which you want to delete the SSL policy and click on its name to access its details.
5. In the instance details page, scroll down to the "Networking" section and click on "Edit" to modify the instance's network settings.
6. In the "Networking" tab, locate the "Security" section and find the "SSL policy" option.
7. Click on the drop-down menu next to the SSL policy option and select "None" to remove the SSL policy from the instance.
8. Review the changes and click on the "Save" button to apply the modifications.
9. Repeat steps 4-8 for any other instances for which you want to delete the SSL policy.
10. After deleting the SSL policy for all desired instances, ensure that alternative security measures are in place to protect network communications and comply with security standards.

#### Using CLI

1. Identify the SSL policy: Use the following command to list all the SSL policies associated with Compute Engine instances in GCP:
   `gcloud compute ssl-policies list`

2. Create a new SSL policy: If the existing SSL policy needs to be replaced, create a new SSL policy using the following command:
   `gcloud compute ssl-policies create [SSL_POLICY_NAME] --profile=[PROFILE]`

3. Update the instance: Apply the new SSL policy to the Compute Engine instances using the following command:
   `gcloud compute instances update [INSTANCE_NAME] --update-ssl-policy=[SSL_POLICY_NAME]`

Note: Replace [SSL_POLICY_NAME] with the desired name for the SSL policy, [PROFILE] with the desired profile (e.g., "MODERN" or "COMPATIBLE"), and [INSTANCE_NAME] with the name of the Compute Engine instance.

#### Using Python

1. Inability to enforce SSL/TLS encryption:
- Use the Google Cloud SDK and the `gcloud` command-line tool to retrieve the SSL policy for Compute Engine instances in GCP.
- Analyze the SSL policy settings to identify any misconfigurations or issues that may be preventing the enforcement of SSL/TLS encryption.
- Update the SSL policy settings to ensure that SSL/TLS encryption is properly enforced for incoming traffic.

2. Increased risk of data breaches:
- Implement a monitoring solution that can detect any unauthorized access or data breaches in real-time.
- Regularly review and update firewall rules and access controls to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Implement additional security measures such as intrusion detection systems and data loss prevention tools to further protect against data breaches.

3. Non-compliance with security standards:
- Review the specific security standards and regulations that apply to your organization.
- Identify the SSL/TLS encryption requirements outlined in these standards.
- Implement the necessary SSL policy configurations in GCP Compute Engine instances to ensure compliance with the relevant security standards and regulations.
