### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setQuicOverride event in GCP for Compute refers to an event where the QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) override setting for a target HTTPS proxy is modified.
- QUIC is a transport layer protocol that aims to improve the performance of web applications by reducing latency and improving security.
- This event indicates that the QUIC override setting for a target HTTPS proxy has been changed, potentially impacting the way traffic is handled and optimized for web applications using QUIC.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setQuicOverride API in GCP Compute allows users to override the QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol settings for target HTTPS proxies. If security is impacted with this API, it could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the QUIC protocol settings.

To remediate this issue for GCP Compute using the GCP console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Sign in to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com) using your GCP account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Compute Engine section by selecting "Compute Engine" from the main navigation menu.
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Target HTTPS Proxies" under the "Network services" section.
4. Locate the target HTTPS proxy that needs to be remediated and click on its name to open its details.
5. In the target HTTPS proxy details page, click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page to enter the edit mode.
6. Scroll down to the "QUIC Override" section and ensure that the "QUIC Override" option is set to the desired configuration based on your security requirements.
7. If you want to disable QUIC, select the "Disable" option. If you want to enable QUIC, select the "Enable" option.
8. Once you have made the necessary changes, click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page to apply the configuration changes.
9. Verify that the changes have been successfully applied by checking the target HTTPS proxy's details page.

By following these steps, you can remediate the security impact of v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setQuicOverride in GCP Compute using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

1. Impact on Security: The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setQuicOverride API in GCP Compute allows for overriding the QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol settings for target HTTPS proxies. If misconfigured or misused, it can potentially impact security by enabling or disabling QUIC for HTTPS traffic, which may lead to vulnerabilities or performance issues.

2. Remediation Steps using GCP CLI:
   - Identify the target HTTPS proxy that needs to be remediated. You can use the following command to list all target HTTPS proxies in your project:
     ```
     gcloud compute target-https-proxies list
     ```

   - Once you have identified the target HTTPS proxy, you can update its QUIC override settings using the following command:
     ```
     gcloud compute target-https-proxies update [TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY_NAME] --no-quic-override
     ```
     This command disables the QUIC override for the specified target HTTPS proxy.

   - Verify the changes by listing the target HTTPS proxy again and ensuring that the QUIC override is disabled:
     ```
     gcloud compute target-https-proxies describe [TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY_NAME]
     ```
     Look for the "quicOverride" field in the output, which should be set to "NONE" indicating that QUIC override is disabled.

Note: Replace [TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY_NAME] with the actual name of the target HTTPS proxy you want to remediate.

#### Using Python

1. Impact on Security: The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setQuicOverride API in GCP Compute allows for overriding the QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol settings for target HTTPS proxies. If misconfigured or abused, this API can potentially impact security by enabling or disabling QUIC for HTTPS traffic, which may lead to vulnerabilities or performance issues.

2. Remediation Steps: To remediate this issue for GCP Compute using Python, you can follow these steps:

   a. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```
   pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
   ```

   b. Authenticate and authorize your Python script to access the GCP Compute API:
   ```python
   from google.oauth2 import service_account
   from googleapiclient.discovery import build

   # Path to your service account key JSON file
   service_account_key_file = '/path/to/service_account_key.json'

   # Create credentials from the service account key file
   credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
       service_account_key_file,
       scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute']
   )

   # Build the Compute API client
   compute_service = build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
   ```

   c. Use the Compute API client to update the target HTTPS proxy and disable QUIC:
   ```python
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   target_https_proxy_name = 'your-target-https-proxy-name'

   # Disable QUIC for the target HTTPS proxy
   request_body = {
       'quicOverride': 'DISABLE'
   }

   # Send the update request
   response = compute_service.targetHttpsProxies().setQuicOverride(
       project=project_id,
       targetHttpsProxy=target_https_proxy_name,
       body=request_body
   ).execute()

   print('QUIC override for target HTTPS proxy updated successfully.')
   ```

   Note: Replace `'your-project-id'` and `'your-target-https-proxy-name'` with the actual values for your GCP project and target HTTPS proxy.

3. Additional Considerations:
   - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and roles assigned to the service account used for authentication.
   - Test the script in a non-production environment before applying changes to production systems.
   - Monitor the impact of disabling QUIC on your HTTPS traffic and consider any performance implications.
