### Event Information

- The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch event in GCP for Compute refers to a modification or update made to a target HTTPS proxy configuration.
- This event indicates that changes have been made to the settings of a target HTTPS proxy, such as updating the SSL certificate, modifying the backend service, or adjusting the load balancing settings.
- It is important to monitor this event to track any changes made to the target HTTPS proxy configuration and ensure that the modifications align with the desired configuration and security requirements.


### Examples

1. Insecure SSL/TLS configuration: The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch method in GCP allows for modifying the configuration of target HTTPS proxies. If security is impacted, it could potentially result in an insecure SSL/TLS configuration. For example, an attacker could modify the proxy configuration to disable or weaken SSL/TLS encryption, leaving the communication between clients and the backend vulnerable to interception or tampering.

2. Unauthorized access to backend services: If security is impacted with v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch, it could potentially allow unauthorized access to backend services. For instance, an attacker could modify the proxy configuration to redirect traffic to a malicious backend server, bypassing any access controls or authentication mechanisms in place. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or unauthorized execution of actions on the backend.

3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: Another example of security impact with v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch is the potential for enabling or amplifying Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. An attacker could modify the proxy configuration to redirect a large volume of traffic to a specific backend service, overwhelming its resources and causing it to become unresponsive. This could result in service disruption for legitimate users and potentially impact the availability of other services relying on the same backend.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the security issues related to the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch method in GCP Compute using the GCP console, you can follow these steps:

1. Insecure SSL/TLS configuration:
- Access the GCP console and navigate to the Compute Engine section.
- Select the appropriate project and go to the "Load balancing" tab.
- Choose "Target HTTPS proxies" from the left-hand menu.
- Identify the target HTTPS proxy that needs remediation and click on its name.
- In the proxy details page, click on the "Edit" button.
- Review the SSL/TLS configuration settings and ensure they meet the recommended security standards.
- Make any necessary changes to enable or strengthen SSL/TLS encryption.
- Save the changes and verify that the SSL/TLS configuration is now secure.

2. Unauthorized access to backend services:
- Access the GCP console and navigate to the Compute Engine section.
- Select the appropriate project and go to the "Load balancing" tab.
- Choose "Target HTTPS proxies" from the left-hand menu.
- Identify the target HTTPS proxy that needs remediation and click on its name.
- In the proxy details page, click on the "Edit" button.
- Review the backend service configuration and ensure that only authorized backend servers are specified.
- Remove any unauthorized or suspicious backend server configurations.
- Save the changes and verify that the proxy now only allows access to authorized backend services.

3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:
- Access the GCP console and navigate to the Compute Engine section.
- Select the appropriate project and go to the "Load balancing" tab.
- Choose "Target HTTPS proxies" from the left-hand menu.
- Identify the target HTTPS proxy that needs remediation and click on its name.
- In the proxy details page, click on the "Edit" button.
- Review the load balancing settings and ensure that they are properly configured to handle traffic spikes and prevent DoS attacks.
- Implement rate limiting, request throttling, or other mechanisms to mitigate excessive traffic to the backend services.
- Save the changes and verify that the proxy is now protected against DoS attacks by properly managing traffic to the backend services.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate an insecure SSL/TLS configuration in GCP Compute using GCP CLI commands, you can follow these steps:
   - Identify the target HTTPS proxy that needs to be remediated.
   - Use the `gcloud compute target-https-proxies describe` command to retrieve the current configuration.
   - Analyze the configuration and identify any insecure SSL/TLS settings.
   - Use the `gcloud compute target-https-proxies update` command to modify the proxy configuration and enforce secure SSL/TLS settings.
   - Ensure that the updated configuration adheres to best practices for SSL/TLS security, such as using strong cipher suites, enabling perfect forward secrecy, and disabling weak protocols or encryption algorithms.

2. To remediate unauthorized access to backend services in GCP Compute using GCP CLI commands, you can take the following steps:
   - Identify the target HTTPS proxy that is vulnerable to unauthorized access.
   - Use the `gcloud compute target-https-proxies describe` command to retrieve the current configuration.
   - Review the configuration and identify any unauthorized access points or misconfigurations.
   - Use the `gcloud compute target-https-proxies update` command to modify the proxy configuration and enforce proper access controls.
   - Ensure that only authorized backend services are specified in the configuration and that any access controls or authentication mechanisms are properly configured.

3. To remediate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in GCP Compute using GCP CLI commands, you can follow these steps:
   - Identify the target HTTPS proxy that is susceptible to DoS attacks.
   - Use the `gcloud compute target-https-proxies describe` command to retrieve the current configuration.
   - Analyze the configuration and identify any potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could be exploited for DoS attacks.
   - Use the `gcloud compute target-https-proxies update` command to modify the proxy configuration and implement appropriate mitigation measures.
   - Consider implementing rate limiting, request throttling, or other DoS protection mechanisms to prevent excessive traffic from overwhelming the backend services.

#### Using Python

1. Insecure SSL/TLS configuration:
- Use the GCP Python SDK to retrieve the current configuration of target HTTPS proxies.
- Analyze the configuration to identify any insecure SSL/TLS settings, such as weak cipher suites or outdated protocols.
- Use the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch method to update the proxy configuration and enforce secure SSL/TLS settings.
- Ensure that only strong cipher suites and up-to-date protocols are enabled, and disable any insecure options.
- Regularly monitor and audit the SSL/TLS configuration to detect and remediate any potential vulnerabilities.

2. Unauthorized access to backend services:
- Utilize the GCP Python SDK to fetch the existing configuration of target HTTPS proxies.
- Validate the configuration to identify any unauthorized access points or misconfigurations.
- Implement strict access controls and authentication mechanisms for backend services, such as requiring valid credentials or implementing IP whitelisting.
- Use the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch method to update the proxy configuration and enforce proper access controls.
- Regularly review and update the access controls to ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed to reach the backend services.

3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:
- Leverage the GCP Python SDK to retrieve the current configuration of target HTTPS proxies.
- Analyze the configuration to identify any potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited for DoS attacks.
- Implement rate limiting or traffic shaping mechanisms to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks.
