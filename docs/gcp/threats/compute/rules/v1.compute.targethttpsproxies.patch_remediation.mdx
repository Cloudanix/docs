### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch event in GCP for Compute refers to a modification or update made to a target HTTPS proxy configuration.
- This event indicates that changes have been made to the settings of a target HTTPS proxy, such as updating the SSL certificate, modifying the backend service, or adjusting the load balancing settings.
- It is important to monitor this event to track any changes made to the target HTTPS proxy configuration and ensure that the desired settings are applied correctly.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch method in GCP Compute allows for modifying the configuration of a target HTTPS proxy, which can potentially impact security if not used correctly.
- An example of how security can be impacted with this method is if an unauthorized user gains access to the GCP console and modifies the target HTTPS proxy configuration, potentially redirecting traffic to a malicious destination or disrupting the normal flow of traffic.

To remediate this issue for GCP Compute using the GCP console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Access the GCP Console: Log in to your GCP account and navigate to the GCP Console.

2. Navigate to the Target HTTPS Proxies page: In the GCP Console, go to the "Networking" section and select "Network services" and then "Load balancing". From the left-hand menu, click on "Target HTTPS Proxies".

3. Review and modify the target HTTPS proxy configuration: On the Target HTTPS Proxies page, review the existing target HTTPS proxy configurations. Look for any unauthorized or suspicious changes made to the configuration. If any unauthorized changes are found, click on the target HTTPS proxy to view its details.

4. Revert or modify the configuration: If unauthorized changes are detected, click on the "Edit" button to modify the target HTTPS proxy configuration. Revert the changes made by the unauthorized user to restore the original configuration. Ensure that the target HTTPS proxy is configured securely, following best practices for security and compliance.

5. Monitor and audit: Regularly monitor the target HTTPS proxy configurations for any unauthorized changes. Enable logging and auditing features provided by GCP to track and investigate any suspicious activities related to the target HTTPS proxies.

By following these steps, you can remediate the security impact of v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch in GCP Compute using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

- The `v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch` API in GCP Compute allows for modifying the configuration of a target HTTPS proxy, which can potentially impact security if not used correctly.
- An example of a security impact could be if an unauthorized user gains access to the API and modifies the target HTTPS proxy configuration to redirect traffic to a malicious destination, compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the communication.
- To remediate this security issue for GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:
  1. Identify the affected target HTTPS proxy by listing all the target HTTPS proxies in your project using the command: `gcloud compute target-https-proxies list`
  2. Once you have identified the target HTTPS proxy, you can revert the configuration to a known good state by using the `gcloud compute target-https-proxies update` command with the appropriate flags and values. For example: `gcloud compute target-https-proxies update [TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY_NAME] --global --ssl-certificates=[SSL_CERTIFICATE_NAME] --url-map=[URL_MAP_NAME]`
  3. It is also recommended to review and update the access controls and permissions for the affected API to prevent unauthorized access in the future.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch in GCP Compute:
   - If the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch method is misconfigured or misused, it can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities in the target HTTPS proxies of GCP Compute. For example, if an unauthorized user gains access to the patch method and modifies the target HTTPS proxy configuration, it could result in unauthorized access to sensitive data or services.

2. Remediation for GCP Compute using Python:
   - To remediate the security impact of v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch in GCP Compute using Python, you can utilize the Google Cloud Python Client Library. Here's an example script that demonstrates how to update a target HTTPS proxy configuration:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def update_target_https_proxy(project_id, target_https_proxy_name, new_ssl_certificates):
    client = compute_v1.TargetHttpsProxiesClient()

    target_https_proxy_path = client.target_https_proxy_path(project_id, target_https_proxy_name)

    target_https_proxy = client.get(target_https_proxy_path)

    target_https_proxy.ssl_certificates = new_ssl_certificates

    update_mask = {"paths": ["ssl_certificates"]}

    client.update(target_https_proxy_path, target_https_proxy, update_mask=update_mask)

# Usage example
project_id = "your-project-id"
target_https_proxy_name = "your-target-https-proxy-name"
new_ssl_certificates = ["new-ssl-certificate-1", "new-ssl-certificate-2"]

update_target_https_proxy(project_id, target_https_proxy_name, new_ssl_certificates)
```

This script uses the `compute_v1` module from the Google Cloud Python Client Library to update the SSL certificates associated with a target HTTPS proxy. You need to provide your project ID, target HTTPS proxy name, and the new SSL certificates as parameters to the `update_target_https_proxy` function. The `update_mask` is used to specify which fields should be updated in the target HTTPS proxy configuration.
