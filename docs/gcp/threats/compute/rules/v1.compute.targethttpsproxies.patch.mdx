### Event Information

- The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch event in GCP for Compute refers to a modification or update made to a target HTTPS proxy configuration.
- This event indicates that changes have been made to the settings of a target HTTPS proxy, such as updating the SSL certificate, modifying the backend service, or adjusting the load balancing settings.
- It is important to monitor this event to track any changes made to the target HTTPS proxy configuration and ensure that the modifications align with the desired configuration and security requirements.


### Examples

- The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.patch method in GCP Compute allows for the modification of target HTTPS proxies, which can impact security if not properly managed.
- One example of how security can be impacted is if an unauthorized user gains access to the target HTTPS proxy and modifies the configuration, potentially redirecting traffic to malicious destinations.
- Another example is if the patch method is used to disable SSL/TLS encryption on the target HTTPS proxy, leaving the communication between clients and the backend vulnerable to interception and tampering.
- Additionally, if the patch method is used to add insecure or weak cipher suites to the target HTTPS proxy's configuration, it can weaken the security of the SSL/TLS communication, making it easier for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the encryption protocols.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Enable VPC Flow Logs:
- Go to the GCP Console and navigate to the VPC network where the Compute instances are located.
- Select the subnet(s) associated with the instances.
- Click on "Edit" and scroll down to the "Flow logs" section.
- Enable flow logs by selecting the desired configuration options, such as the log destination and filter.
- Save the changes.

2. Implement IAM Roles and Permissions:
- Go to the GCP Console and navigate to the IAM & Admin section.
- Click on "Roles" and search for the appropriate roles that need to be assigned to the Compute instances.
- Select the desired role(s) and click on "Add Members".
- Enter the email addresses of the users or service accounts that need to be granted the roles.
- Click on "Save" to apply the changes.

3. Configure Firewall Rules:
- Go to the GCP Console and navigate to the VPC network where the Compute instances are located.
- Click on "Firewall rules" and then "Create Firewall Rule".
- Provide a name and description for the rule.
- Specify the source and destination IP ranges, ports, and protocols as per the desired configuration.
- Choose the appropriate action (allow or deny) and priority for the rule.
- Save the rule to apply it to the network.

Note: These steps assume that you have the necessary permissions to access and modify the GCP resources. Adjust the instructions accordingly if you have different roles or access levels.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issues mentioned in the previous response for GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Disable SSH access for the default service account:
   - Use the following command to get the email address of the default service account:
     ```
     gcloud iam service-accounts list --filter="displayName:Compute Engine default service account"
     ```
   - Once you have the email address, use the following command to remove the roles associated with SSH access:
     ```
     gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member=serviceAccount:EMAIL_ADDRESS --role=roles/compute.osLogin
     ```

2. Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring:
   - Use the following command to enable VPC Flow Logs for a specific subnet:
     ```
     gcloud compute networks subnets update SUBNET_NAME --region=REGION --enable-flow-logs
     ```

3. Restrict public access to Cloud Storage buckets:
   - Use the following command to update the bucket ACL and remove all public access:
     ```
     gsutil iam ch allUsers:legacyObjectReader gs://BUCKET_NAME
     ```

Please note that you need to replace the placeholders (PROJECT_ID, EMAIL_ADDRESS, SUBNET_NAME, REGION, and BUCKET_NAME) with the actual values specific to your GCP environment.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issues mentioned in the previous response for GCP Compute using Python, you can use the following approaches:

1. Enforce strong passwords:
   - Use the Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) API to create a custom password policy for your GCP project.
   - Write a Python script to programmatically enforce the password policy by setting the minimum password length, complexity requirements, and password expiration rules for all user accounts.

2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):
   - Use the Google Cloud IAM API to enable MFA for all user accounts in your GCP project.
   - Write a Python script to automate the process of enabling MFA for each user, using the Google Cloud IAM API's `setIamPolicy` method.

3. Implement network security controls:
   - Use the Google Cloud Firewall API to create firewall rules that restrict inbound and outbound traffic to and from your GCP Compute instances.
   - Write a Python script to programmatically create and manage firewall rules, using the Google Cloud Firewall API's `insert` and `update` methods.

Please note that the actual implementation of these scripts may vary depending on your specific requirements and the Python libraries you choose to use.
