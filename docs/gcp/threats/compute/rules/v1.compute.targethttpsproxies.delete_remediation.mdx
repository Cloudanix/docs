### Event Information

- The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete event in GCP for Compute indicates that a target HTTPS proxy has been deleted.
- This event signifies that the specified target HTTPS proxy, which is responsible for forwarding HTTPS traffic to a backend service, has been removed from the GCP environment.
- It is important to note that deleting a target HTTPS proxy will result in the termination of any existing connections and the removal of associated configurations.


### Examples

- Unauthorized deletion of target HTTPS proxies: If security is impacted with v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete in GCP, it could potentially allow unauthorized individuals to delete target HTTPS proxies. This could lead to disruption of traffic routing and potential denial of service attacks.

- Misconfiguration of access controls: If security is impacted, it could be due to misconfiguration of access controls for the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete API. This could result in unauthorized users gaining access to the API and being able to delete target HTTPS proxies without proper authorization.

- Lack of audit trail: If security is impacted, it could be due to a lack of proper logging and auditing mechanisms for the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete API. This could make it difficult to track and investigate any unauthorized deletions, hindering incident response and forensic analysis.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the unauthorized deletion of target HTTPS proxies in GCP Compute using the GCP console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Review and update access controls:
   - Access the GCP console and navigate to the IAM & Admin section.
   - Identify the roles and permissions assigned to users or service accounts that have access to the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete API.
   - Ensure that only authorized individuals or service accounts have the necessary permissions to delete target HTTPS proxies.
   - Remove any unnecessary or overly permissive access rights to mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletions.

2. Enable audit logging:
   - Access the GCP console and navigate to the Logging section.
   - Enable audit logging for the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete API.
   - Configure the logging to capture relevant information such as the user or service account performing the deletion, the timestamp, and any additional details that can aid in incident investigation.
   - Regularly review the audit logs to detect any suspicious or unauthorized deletion activities.

3. Implement monitoring and alerts:
   - Access the GCP console and navigate to the Monitoring section.
   - Set up monitoring and alerts for the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete API.
   - Define thresholds or conditions that trigger an alert when unusual or unauthorized deletion activities are detected.
   - Configure the alerts to notify the appropriate personnel or teams responsible for incident response, enabling them to take immediate action in case of any unauthorized deletions.

By following these steps, you can enhance the security of your GCP Compute environment and mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of target HTTPS proxies.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the unauthorized deletion of target HTTPS proxies in GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can take the following steps:

1. Review and update access controls: Ensure that the access controls for the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete API are properly configured. Limit access to authorized individuals or roles only. You can use the following CLI command to update access controls:

   ```
   gcloud compute target-https-proxies update [TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY_NAME] --no-allow-service-accounts --no-allow-unregistered-calls
   ```

   Replace [TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY_NAME] with the name of the target HTTPS proxy that needs to be protected.

2. Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete API to create an audit trail of all API activities. This will help in tracking and investigating any unauthorized deletions. Use the following CLI command to enable audit logging:

   ```
   gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME] --log-filter='resource.type="httpTargetProxy" protoPayload.methodName="v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete"'
   ```

   Replace [SINK_NAME] with a name for the logging sink and [BUCKET_NAME] with the name of the Cloud Storage bucket where the logs will be stored.

3. Monitor and alert on deletion events: Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and notify any deletion events related to target HTTPS proxies. This can be done using Cloud Monitoring or a third-party monitoring tool. Configure alerts to notify the appropriate personnel when unauthorized deletions are detected.

By implementing these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of target HTTPS proxies and ensure the security of your GCP Compute environment.

#### Using Python

To remediate the unauthorized deletion of target HTTPS proxies in GCP Compute using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement proper access controls: Review and update the access controls for the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete API to ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete target HTTPS proxies. You can use the Google Cloud IAM API in Python to manage IAM policies and roles programmatically.

```python
from google.cloud import iam

def update_iam_policy(project_id, target_proxy_name):
    client = iam.IAMClient()
    policy = client.get_policy(project_id)
    
    # Update the policy to grant appropriate permissions for the target proxy
    # e.g., add or modify bindings for the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete API
    
    updated_policy = client.set_policy(project_id, policy)
    print(f"Updated IAM policy for project {project_id}: {updated_policy}")
```

2. Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete API to capture relevant events and actions. This will help in tracking and investigating any unauthorized deletions. You can use the Google Cloud Logging API in Python to configure and manage audit logs.

```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2

def enable_audit_logging(project_id, target_proxy_name):
    client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
    
    # Configure audit logging for the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete API
    # e.g., create a log sink and set up log filters
    
    print(f"Audit logging enabled for project {project_id}")
```

3. Implement monitoring and alerting: Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect any suspicious or unauthorized activities related to the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete API. You can use the Google Cloud Monitoring API in Python to create custom metrics, set up alerts, and trigger notifications.

```python
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3

def create_alert_policy(project_id, target_proxy_name):
    client = monitoring_v3.AlertPolicyServiceClient()
    
    # Create an alert policy to monitor the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete API
    # e.g., define conditions, thresholds, and notification channels
    
    print(f"Alert policy created for project {project_id}")
```

By implementing these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of target HTTPS proxies in GCP Compute and enhance the security of your environment.
