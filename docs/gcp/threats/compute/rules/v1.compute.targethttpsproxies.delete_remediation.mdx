### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete event in GCP for Compute indicates that a target HTTPS proxy has been deleted.
- This event signifies that the specified target HTTPS proxy, which is responsible for forwarding HTTPS traffic to a backend service, has been removed from the GCP environment.
- It is important to note that deleting a target HTTPS proxy will result in the termination of any existing connections and the removal of associated configurations.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- The security impact of v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete in GCP Compute is that it allows the deletion of target HTTPS proxies, which can potentially disrupt the traffic flow to the backend services associated with those proxies.
- An example of this security impact would be an unauthorized user gaining access to the GCP console or API and deleting a target HTTPS proxy that is critical for the operation of a web application. This would result in the application becoming inaccessible over HTTPS.

To remediate this security issue for GCP Compute using the GCP console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Sign in to the GCP console using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the Compute Engine section by clicking on the "Compute Engine" option in the main menu.
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Target HTTPS Proxies" under the "Network services" section.
4. Identify the target HTTPS proxy that needs to be secured and click on its name to open its details.
5. In the target HTTPS proxy details page, click on the "Permissions" tab.
6. Review the current permissions and ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary roles to delete target HTTPS proxies.
7. If you need to modify the permissions, click on the "Edit" button next to the "Permissions" section.
8. In the permissions editor, remove any unnecessary or unauthorized roles that have the ability to delete target HTTPS proxies.
9. Add the necessary roles to the appropriate users or service accounts who should have the ability to delete target HTTPS proxies.
10. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the security impact of v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete in GCP Compute by properly managing the permissions and access control for target HTTPS proxies.

#### Using CLI

- The `v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete` operation in GCP Compute allows for the deletion of a target HTTPS proxy, which can potentially impact security if not handled properly.
- An example of how security can be impacted is if a target HTTPS proxy is deleted without proper authorization or authentication checks, allowing unauthorized access to the backend services associated with the proxy.
- To remediate this issue for GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:
  1. First, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform the delete operation on the target HTTPS proxy.
  2. Use the `gcloud compute target-https-proxies delete` command to delete the target HTTPS proxy. Replace `[TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY]` with the name or ID of the target HTTPS proxy you want to delete.
  3. Double-check the deletion by using the `gcloud compute target-https-proxies describe` command with the same `[TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY]` parameter to confirm that the target HTTPS proxy has been successfully deleted.

Example CLI commands:
```
gcloud compute target-https-proxies delete [TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY]
gcloud compute target-https-proxies describe [TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY]
```

#### Using Python

- The `v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.delete` API in GCP Compute allows for the deletion of target HTTPS proxies, which can potentially impact security if not used properly.
- An example of how security can be impacted is if a target HTTPS proxy is deleted without proper authorization or authentication, allowing unauthorized access to the backend services associated with the proxy.
- To remediate this issue in GCP Compute using Python, you can use the Google Cloud Client Library for Python. Here's an example script that demonstrates how to delete a target HTTPS proxy with proper authentication and authorization:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def delete_target_https_proxy(project_id, target_https_proxy_name):
    client = compute_v1.TargetHttpsProxiesClient()
    target_https_proxy_path = client.target_https_proxy_path(project_id, target_https_proxy_name)
    client.delete(target_https_proxy_path)

# Usage example
project_id = 'your-project-id'
target_https_proxy_name = 'your-target-https-proxy-name'
delete_target_https_proxy(project_id, target_https_proxy_name)
```

Make sure to replace `'your-project-id'` with your actual GCP project ID and `'your-target-https-proxy-name'` with the name of the target HTTPS proxy you want to delete. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary permissions and authentication set up for the script to run successfully.
