### Event Information

1. The v1.compute.urlMaps.patch event in GCP for Compute refers to a modification or update made to a URL map configuration in the Google Cloud Platform.

2. This event indicates that changes have been made to the settings of a URL map, which is used to route incoming requests to the appropriate backend service or target proxy based on the requested URL.

3. The event can be triggered when modifications are made to the URL map's path matcher rules, host rules, or any other relevant configuration settings. It is important to monitor and track these events to ensure the proper functioning and routing of traffic within your GCP environment.


### Examples

None

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Insecure URL redirection:
- Access the GCP Console and navigate to the Compute Engine section.
- Select the appropriate project and go to the "URL Maps" page.
- Identify the URL map that needs to be remediated and click on it.
- In the URL map details page, click on the "Edit" button.
- Review the configuration and locate the section related to URL redirection.
- Ensure that the target URL is properly configured and does not redirect to any malicious or unauthorized websites.
- Make the necessary changes to fix the misconfiguration.
- Save the changes and verify that the URL redirection is now secure.

2. Access control vulnerabilities:
- Access the GCP Console and navigate to the Compute Engine section.
- Select the appropriate project and go to the "URL Maps" page.
- Identify the URL map that needs to be remediated and click on it.
- In the URL map details page, click on the "Edit" button.
- Review the configuration and locate the section related to access controls.
- Ensure that the access controls are properly configured to restrict access to sensitive resources or APIs.
- Make the necessary changes to fix any misconfigurations, such as adding or removing allowed IP ranges or adjusting authentication settings.
- Save the changes and verify that the access controls are now properly configured.

3. SSL/TLS certificate issues:
- Access the GCP Console and navigate to the Compute Engine section.
- Select the appropriate project and go to the "URL Maps" page.
- Identify the URL map that needs to be remediated and click on it.
- In the URL map details page, click on the "Edit" button.
- Review the configuration and locate the section related to SSL/TLS certificates.
- Ensure that a valid and up-to-date certificate is configured for the URL map.
- If a certificate needs to be renewed or replaced, follow the appropriate steps to obtain a new certificate.
- Update the URL map configuration with the new certificate information.
- Save the changes and verify that the SSL/TLS certificate is now properly configured.

#### Using CLI

1. Insecure URL redirection:
- Identify the misconfigured URL redirection by reviewing the URL maps configuration.
- Update the URL maps using the `gcloud compute url-maps patch` command, ensuring that the redirection is configured securely and pointing to trusted destinations.
- Regularly monitor and audit the URL maps configuration to detect any potential misconfigurations.

2. Access control vulnerabilities:
- Review the access control settings for the URL maps using the `gcloud compute url-maps describe` command.
- Identify any misconfigured access controls that may allow unauthorized access.
- Update the access controls using the `gcloud compute url-maps update` command, ensuring that only authorized entities have access to the resources or APIs.

3. SSL/TLS certificate issues:
- Review the SSL/TLS certificate configuration for the URL maps using the `gcloud compute ssl-certificates describe` command.
- Identify any weak or expired certificates that need to be replaced.
- Update the SSL/TLS certificates using the `gcloud compute ssl-certificates update` command, ensuring that strong and valid certificates are used to secure the communication between clients and the server.

#### Using Python

1. Insecure URL redirection:
- Identify and review the existing URL maps configuration in GCP Compute.
- Update the URL maps to ensure that the redirection rules are properly configured and do not redirect users to malicious or unauthorized websites.
- Regularly monitor and audit the URL maps configuration to detect any potential misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.

2. Access control vulnerabilities:
- Review the access control settings for the URL maps in GCP Compute.
- Ensure that proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to restrict access to sensitive resources or APIs.
- Regularly review and update the access control settings to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential security risks.

3. SSL/TLS certificate issues:
- Review the SSL/TLS certificate configuration for the URL maps in GCP Compute.
- Ensure that valid and up-to-date certificates are used to establish secure communication between clients and the server.
- Implement a certificate management process that includes regular certificate renewal and monitoring for any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the SSL/TLS configuration.

Python script example for updating URL maps in GCP Compute:
```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def update_url_map(project_id, url_map_name, new_url):
    compute_client = compute_v1.URLMapsClient()

    url_map = compute_client.get(project=project_id, urlMap=url_map_name)

    # Update the URL map with the new URL
    url_map.defaultService = new_url

    # Patch the URL map with the updated configuration
    compute_client.patch(project=project_id, urlMap=url_map_name, urlMap=url_map)

# Usage example
update_url_map('my-project', 'my-url-map', 'https://example.com')
```
Note: This is a basic example and may need to be customized based on the specific requirements and structure of your GCP Compute environment.
