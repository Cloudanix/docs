### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The v1.compute.urlMaps.patch event in GCP for Compute refers to a modification or update made to a URL map configuration in the Google Cloud Platform.

2. This event indicates that changes have been made to the settings of a URL map, which is used to route incoming requests to the appropriate backend service or target proxy based on the requested URL.

3. The v1.compute.urlMaps.patch event can be triggered when modifications are made to the URL map's path matcher rules, host rules, or any other relevant configuration settings. It is an important event to monitor and track for managing and maintaining the routing of traffic in a GCP environment.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the v1.compute.urlMaps.patch API in GCP Compute, they can potentially modify the URL mappings for load balancers, leading to unauthorized access or redirecting traffic to malicious destinations.

- Remediation steps using GCP console:
  1. Access the GCP Console and navigate to the Compute Engine section.
  2. Select the appropriate project and go to the Load balancing page.
  3. Identify the affected URL map and click on it to open the details.
  4. In the URL map details, click on the "Edit" button to make changes.
  5. Review the existing URL mappings and ensure they are correct and secure.
  6. If any unauthorized or suspicious URL mappings are found, remove or modify them accordingly.
  7. Save the changes and verify that the URL map is now secure.
  8. Regularly monitor and audit the URL mappings to ensure ongoing security.

Note: It is recommended to follow the principle of least privilege and restrict access to the v1.compute.urlMaps.patch API to only authorized users or service accounts. Additionally, enabling audit logs and monitoring for any suspicious activity can help detect and respond to security incidents promptly.

#### Using CLI

- One example of how security can be impacted with `v1.compute.urlMaps.patch` in GCP for Compute is if the patch introduces a misconfiguration or vulnerability in the URL mapping configuration, allowing unauthorized access to resources or exposing sensitive information.

To remediate this issue for GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the specific security impact caused by the `v1.compute.urlMaps.patch` operation. This could involve reviewing the changes made to the URL mapping configuration and understanding the potential risks associated with those changes.

2. Use the GCP CLI to revert the changes made by the `v1.compute.urlMaps.patch` operation. You can do this by executing the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute url-maps update [URL_MAP_NAME] --project=[PROJECT_ID] --delete-query-string
   ```

   Replace `[URL_MAP_NAME]` with the name of the affected URL map and `[PROJECT_ID]` with your GCP project ID. The `--delete-query-string` flag is optional and should be used if the patch introduced changes to the query string handling that need to be reverted.

3. Validate the changes by verifying that the URL mapping configuration is restored to its previous state and that the security impact has been mitigated.

Note: The specific commands and flags may vary depending on your GCP CLI version and the specific details of your environment. It is recommended to refer to the official GCP documentation or consult with GCP support for the most up-to-date and accurate information.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with v1.compute.urlMaps.patch in GCP Compute:
   - If the v1.compute.urlMaps.patch API call is misconfigured or unauthorized access is granted, it could potentially allow an attacker to modify the URL mappings for a load balancer. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources or redirect traffic to malicious destinations.

2. Remediation for GCP Compute using Python:
   - To remediate the security impact of v1.compute.urlMaps.patch in GCP Compute, you can use the Google Cloud Python Client Library to ensure proper authorization and validation of the API call. Here's an example Python script:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def patch_url_map(project_id, region, url_map_name, patch_body):
    compute_client = compute_v1.URLMapsClient()

    url_map_path = compute_client.url_map_path(project_id, region, url_map_name)

    patch_request = compute_v1.PatchRegionUrlMapRequest(
        url_map=url_map_path,
        url_map_resource=patch_body
    )

    response = compute_client.patch_region_url_map(request=patch_request)

    print("URL map patched successfully:", response)

# Usage example
project_id = "your-project-id"
region = "us-central1"
url_map_name = "your-url-map-name"
patch_body = {
    # Provide the necessary fields to patch the URL map
    # For example, you can update the defaultBackendService or pathMatchers
}

patch_url_map(project_id, region, url_map_name, patch_body)
```

Note: Make sure to replace the placeholders (`your-project-id`, `your-url-map-name`, and the patch body) with the actual values specific to your environment and requirements.
