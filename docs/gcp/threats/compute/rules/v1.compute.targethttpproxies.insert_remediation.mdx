### Event Information

- The v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.insert event in GCP for Compute refers to the creation of a target HTTP proxy in the Google Cloud Platform.
- This event occurs when a user or an automated process initiates the creation of a target HTTP proxy, which is used to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to a backend service.
- The event signifies the start of the process to create a target HTTP proxy, and it is an important step in configuring load balancing and routing rules for HTTP traffic in GCP Compute Engine.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized access: If security is impacted with v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.insert in GCP for Compute, it could potentially allow unauthorized users to insert or modify target HTTP proxies. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources or data within the GCP environment.

2. Data breaches: A security impact of v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.insert in GCP for Compute could result in data breaches. If an attacker gains access to the target HTTP proxies, they may be able to intercept or manipulate network traffic, potentially exposing sensitive information or compromising the integrity of the data being transmitted.

3. Service disruption: Another security impact of v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.insert in GCP for Compute is the potential for service disruption. If an unauthorized user inserts or modifies target HTTP proxies, they may be able to redirect or block traffic, causing service interruptions or denial of service attacks on the affected resources or applications. This can result in downtime and loss of productivity for users relying on those services.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruption related to v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.insert in GCP for Compute using the GCP console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

   - Log in to the GCP console.
   - Navigate to the Compute Engine section.
   - Select "Target HTTP Proxies" from the left-hand menu.
   - Review the list of existing target HTTP proxies and their configurations.

2. Remove unauthorized or unnecessary target HTTP proxies:
   - Identify any target HTTP proxies that are unauthorized or no longer needed.
   - Select the target HTTP proxy from the list.
   - Click on the "Delete" button to remove the target HTTP proxy.
   - Confirm the deletion when prompted.

3. Implement access controls and monitoring:
   - Set up proper access controls to restrict who can create or modify target HTTP proxies.
   - Regularly monitor and review the creation and modification of target HTTP proxies for any unauthorized activities.
   - Enable logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and alert on any suspicious or malicious activities related to target HTTP proxies.

By following these steps, you can remediate unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruption risks associated with v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.insert in GCP for Compute using the GCP console.

    # Disable the target HTTP proxy
    target_http_proxy = compute_client.get(target_http_proxy_path)
    target_http_proxy.proxy_bind = False

    # Update the target HTTP proxy
    update_mask = {"paths": ["proxy_bind"]}
    compute_client.update(target_http_proxy_path, target_http_proxy, update_mask=update_mask)

    print(f"Unauthorized access remediated for target HTTP proxy: {target_http_proxy_name}")

# Usage
project_id = "your-project-id"
