### Event Information

1. The v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete event in GCP for Compute indicates that a target HTTP proxy has been deleted in the specified project.
2. This event signifies that any traffic previously routed through the deleted target HTTP proxy will no longer be directed to the associated backend service.
3. It is important to review the reason for the deletion and ensure that any necessary configurations or replacements are made to maintain the desired traffic routing and load balancing within the GCP environment.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete in GCP for Compute, one example could be an unauthorized user gaining access to the API and deleting target HTTP proxies. This could result in disruption of traffic routing and potential denial of service attacks.

2. Misconfiguration: Another example could be a misconfiguration in access controls or permissions, allowing users with lower privileges to delete target HTTP proxies. This could lead to accidental or intentional deletion of critical resources, impacting the security and availability of applications.

3. Lack of audit trail: If proper logging and monitoring mechanisms are not in place, it may be difficult to track and investigate any unauthorized or malicious deletion of target HTTP proxies. This lack of visibility can hinder incident response efforts and make it challenging to identify the root cause of security incidents.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion, misconfiguration, and lack of audit trail for GCP Compute using the GCP console, you can follow these steps:

1. Unauthorized deletion:
   - Enable Identity and Access Management (IAM) for your GCP project.
   - Grant appropriate permissions to users and service accounts based on the principle of least privilege.
   - Regularly review and audit IAM roles and permissions to ensure they are up to date and aligned with your security requirements.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user accounts to add an extra layer of security.

2. Misconfiguration:
   - Review and validate your access controls and permissions for target HTTP proxies.
   - Ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary permissions to modify or delete target HTTP proxies.
   - Regularly perform security assessments and audits to identify any misconfigurations and promptly address them.
   - Implement automated configuration management tools to enforce consistent and secure configurations across your GCP environment.

3. Lack of audit trail:
   - Enable Cloud Audit Logging for your GCP project to capture detailed logs of API activity, including target HTTP proxy deletions.
   - Configure log sinks to export logs to a centralized logging solution for long-term retention and analysis.
   - Implement real-time monitoring and alerting on critical API activities, such as target HTTP proxy deletions, to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.
   - Regularly review and analyze the logs to identify any unauthorized or suspicious activities and investigate them accordingly.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of target HTTP proxies in GCP Compute, you can take the following steps using GCP CLI commands:

- Implement strict access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have access to the GCP API and relevant resources. Use IAM roles and permissions to restrict access to target HTTP proxies and other critical resources. For example, you can grant the `compute.targetHttpProxies.delete` permission only to trusted users or service accounts.

- Enable audit logging: Enable Cloud Audit Logs to capture all API activity, including deletions of target HTTP proxies. This will provide an audit trail for monitoring and investigating any unauthorized actions. Use the following command to enable audit logging for Compute API:

  ```
  gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME] --log-filter='resource.type="httpTargetProxy" protoPayload.methodName="v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete"'
  ```

- Implement monitoring and alerting: Set up alerts or notifications to be triggered whenever a target HTTP proxy is deleted. This can help in detecting and responding to unauthorized deletion attempts promptly. Use Cloud Monitoring or a third-party monitoring tool to configure relevant alerts.

2. Misconfiguration: To remediate misconfigurations that allow unauthorized deletion of target HTTP proxies in GCP Compute, you can follow these steps using GCP CLI commands:

- Regularly review and update access controls: Periodically review and update IAM roles and permissions to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary privileges. Remove any unnecessary or overly permissive access. Use the following command to list IAM bindings for target HTTP proxies:

  ```
  gcloud compute target-http-proxies get-iam-policy [TARGET_HTTP_PROXY_NAME] --project=[PROJECT_ID] --region=[REGION]
  ```

- Implement resource hierarchy and organization policies: Utilize resource hierarchy and organization policies to enforce consistent access controls across your GCP environment. This can help prevent misconfigurations at scale. Refer to the GCP documentation for detailed instructions on implementing organization policies.

- Conduct regular security assessments: Perform regular security assessments and audits to identify and address any misconfigurations in access controls or permissions. Use tools like Cloud Security Command Center or third-party security assessment tools to automate this process.

3. Lack of audit trail: To remediate the lack of audit trail for deletions of target HTTP proxies in GCP Compute, you can take the following steps using GCP CLI commands:

- Enable Cloud Audit Logs: Enable Cloud Audit Logs for Compute API to capture detailed logs of API activity, including deletions of target HTTP proxies. Use the following command to enable Cloud Audit Logs for Compute API:

  ```
  gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME] --log-filter='resource.type="httpTargetProxy"'
  ```

- Configure log retention: Set an appropriate log retention period to ensure that audit logs are retained for a sufficient duration. Use the following command to configure log retention for Cloud Audit Logs:

  ```
  gcloud logging sinks update [SINK_NAME] storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME] --retention-days=[DAYS]
  ```

- Implement log analysis and monitoring: Utilize log analysis and monitoring tools like Cloud Logging or third-party SIEM solutions to analyze and monitor the audit logs. Create alerts or notifications for any suspicious or unauthorized deletion activities.

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of target HTTP proxies in GCP Compute using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

- Implement proper access controls and permissions: Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary privileges to delete target HTTP proxies. Use IAM roles and permissions to restrict access to sensitive resources.

- Enable audit logging: Enable Cloud Audit Logs for Compute Engine API activities. This will provide a detailed audit trail of API calls, including deletions of target HTTP proxies. You can use the `google-cloud-logging` library in Python to retrieve and analyze these logs.

- Implement monitoring and alerting: Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect any suspicious or unauthorized deletion activities. Use Cloud Monitoring to create custom metrics and alerts based on API deletion events. You can use the `google-cloud-monitoring` library in Python to programmatically create and manage these alerts.

2. Misconfiguration: To remediate misconfigurations in access controls or permissions for deleting target HTTP proxies in GCP Compute using Python scripts, consider the following steps:
