### Event Information

- The v1.compute.instances.delete event in GCP for Compute refers to the deletion of a virtual machine instance in the Google Cloud Platform.
- This event indicates that a specific virtual machine instance has been permanently removed from the Compute Engine.
- It is important to note that this event is irreversible and all data associated with the instance will be lost.


### Examples

- Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with v1.compute.instances.delete in GCP, it could potentially allow unauthorized users or malicious actors to delete compute instances without proper authorization. This could lead to data loss, service disruption, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

- Data breach: If a compute instance is deleted using v1.compute.instances.delete without proper security measures in place, it could result in a data breach. This is because the instance may contain sensitive data that could be accessed or recovered by unauthorized individuals.

- Service disruption: Deleting compute instances without proper authorization or safeguards can lead to service disruption. This can impact the availability and performance of applications or services running on those instances, potentially causing downtime and loss of productivity for users.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion of compute instances in GCP using the GCP console, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement IAM (Identity and Access Management) controls:
   - Review and update IAM policies to ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete compute instances.
   - Use the principle of least privilege, granting only the minimum required permissions to perform deletion operations.
   - Regularly review and audit IAM policies to identify and remove any unnecessary or excessive permissions.

2. Enable resource-level permissions:
   - Utilize GCP's resource-level permissions to restrict access to compute instances.
   - Assign specific roles or permissions to users or groups based on their responsibilities and requirements.
   - Avoid granting broad permissions that allow deletion of all compute instances.

3. Enable audit logging and monitoring:
   - Enable Cloud Audit Logs to track and monitor all deletion activities related to compute instances.
   - Set up alerts or notifications to be notified of any suspicious or unauthorized deletion attempts.
   - Regularly review audit logs to identify any unauthorized deletion activities and take appropriate actions.

By implementing these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of compute instances in GCP and ensure the security and availability of your resources.

#### Using CLI

To remediate unauthorized deletion of compute instances in GCP, you can take the following steps using GCP CLI:

1. Implement IAM (Identity and Access Management) controls:
   - Grant only necessary permissions to users or service accounts to prevent unauthorized deletion.
   - Use the principle of least privilege and regularly review and update access permissions.

2. Enable audit logging and monitoring:
   - Enable Cloud Audit Logs to track and monitor all API calls, including compute instance deletions.
   - Set up alerts or notifications to be notified of any unauthorized deletion attempts.

3. Implement backup and recovery mechanisms:
   - Regularly backup critical data and configurations of compute instances.
   - Utilize GCP's snapshot feature or other backup solutions to create backups at regular intervals.
   - Test the restoration process to ensure data can be recovered in case of accidental or unauthorized deletion.

CLI commands for GCP:

1. Granting necessary permissions:
   ```
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=[MEMBER] --role=[ROLE]
   ```

2. Enabling audit logging:
   ```
   gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME] --log-filter='protoPayload.methodName="v1.compute.instances.delete"'
   ```

3. Creating a snapshot for backup:
   ```
   gcloud compute disks snapshot [DISK_NAME] --snapshot-name=[SNAPSHOT_NAME] --zone=[ZONE]
   ```

Note: Replace the placeholders [PROJECT_ID], [MEMBER], [ROLE], [SINK_NAME], [BUCKET_NAME], [DISK_NAME], [SNAPSHOT_NAME], and [ZONE] with the appropriate values for your environment.

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of compute instances in GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete compute instances. This can be done by configuring IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles and policies in GCP.

```python
from google.cloud import iam

def grant_delete_permission(project_id, instance_name, member):
    client = iam.IAMClient()
    policy = client.get_policy(request={"resource": f"projects/{project_id}"})
    
    binding = next((b for b in policy.bindings if b.role == "roles/compute.instanceAdmin"), None)
    if binding:
        binding.members.append(member)
    else:
        binding = iam.Binding(
            role="roles/compute.instanceAdmin",
            members=[member]
        )
        policy.bindings.append(binding)
    
    client.set_policy(request={"resource": f"projects/{project_id}", "policy": policy})
```

2. Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for compute instances in GCP. This will help in tracking and monitoring any unauthorized deletion attempts. You can configure the logging using Cloud Logging in GCP.

```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2

def enable_audit_logging(project_id, instance_name):
    client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
    resource = f"projects/{project_id}/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity"
    
    sink = logging_v2.LogSink(
        name=f"projects/{project_id}/sinks/{instance_name}-audit-logs",
        destination=f"bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/{project_id}/datasets/{instance_name}_audit_logs",
        filter=f'resource.type="gce_instance" AND protoPayload.methodName="v1.compute.instances.delete" AND protoPayload.resourceName="projects/{project_id}/zones/{zone}/instances/{instance_name}"',
        output_version_format=logging_v2.LogSink.VersionFormat.V2
    )
    
    client.create_sink(request={"parent": f"projects/{project_id}", "sink": sink})
```

3. Implement backup and recovery mechanisms: Regularly backup your compute instances to prevent data loss in case of accidental or unauthorized deletion. You can use GCP's snapshot feature to create backups of your instances.

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def create_instance_snapshot(project_id, zone, instance_name, snapshot_name):
    client = compute_v1.SnapshotsClient()
    snapshot_body = {
        "name": snapshot_name,
        "source_disk": f"projects/{project_id}/zones/{zone}/disks/{instance_name}",
        "storage_locations": [f"projects/{project_id}/locations/{zone}"]
    }
    
    operation = client.create(request={"project": project_id, "snapshot_resource": snapshot_body})
    operation.result()
```
