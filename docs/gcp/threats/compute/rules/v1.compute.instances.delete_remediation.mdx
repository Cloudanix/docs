### Event Information

- The v1.compute.instances.delete event in GCP for Compute refers to the deletion of a virtual machine instance in the Google Cloud Platform.
- This event indicates that a specific virtual machine instance has been permanently removed from the Compute Engine.
- It is important to note that this event is irreversible and all data associated with the instance will be lost.


### Examples

- Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with v1.compute.instances.delete in GCP, it could potentially allow unauthorized users or malicious actors to delete compute instances without proper authorization. This could lead to data loss, service disruption, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

- Data breach: If a compute instance is deleted using v1.compute.instances.delete without proper security measures in place, it could result in a data breach. This is because the instance may contain sensitive data that could be accessed or recovered by unauthorized individuals.

- Service disruption: Deleting compute instances without proper authorization or safeguards can lead to service disruption. This can impact the availability and performance of applications or services running on those instances, potentially causing downtime and loss of productivity for users.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion, lack of access controls, and insufficient logging and monitoring in GCP Compute using the GCP console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Unauthorized deletion:
   - Implement strong authentication and access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have access to the GCP console and the Compute API. Use strong passwords, enforce multi-factor authentication, and regularly review and update user access permissions.
   - Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for Compute Engine API activities. This will help track and identify any unauthorized deletion attempts. You can enable audit logging in the GCP console by navigating to "Logging" under "Stackdriver" and configuring the appropriate logs and filters.

2. Lack of access controls:
   - Review and update IAM roles and permissions: Regularly review and update the IAM roles and permissions assigned to users and service accounts. Ensure that only necessary permissions are granted and that the principle of least privilege is followed.
   - Implement resource hierarchy and organization policies: Utilize resource hierarchy and organization policies to enforce access controls at the project, folder, and organization levels. This will help prevent unauthorized access and deletion of instances.

3. Insufficient logging and monitoring:
   - Enable Stackdriver Monitoring: Enable Stackdriver Monitoring to gain visibility into the performance and health of your Compute Engine instances. Set up appropriate monitoring metrics, alerts, and dashboards to track and identify any suspicious activities.
   - Configure Stackdriver Logging: Configure Stackdriver Logging to capture and analyze logs related to Compute Engine instances. Create log sinks and filters to ensure that relevant logs are collected and retained for analysis. Regularly review the logs to identify any unauthorized or malicious deletion events.

By following these steps, you can remediate unauthorized deletion, lack of access controls, and insufficient logging and monitoring in GCP Compute using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion:
- Implement strong authentication and access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have access to the API and the ability to delete instances. Use strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and enforce least privilege principles.
- Enable audit logging: Enable detailed audit logging for the API calls related to instance deletion. This will help in tracking and identifying any unauthorized deletion attempts. Use the following GCP CLI command to enable audit logging for Compute Engine API:
  ```
  gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME] --log-filter='resource.type="gce_instance" protoPayload.methodName="v1.compute.instances.delete"'
  ```

2. Lack of access controls:
- Implement granular IAM roles and permissions: Define and assign IAM roles with appropriate permissions to users and service accounts. Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete instances. Use the following GCP CLI command to assign IAM roles to a user:
  ```
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=[MEMBER] --role=[ROLE]
  ```

3. Insufficient logging and monitoring:
- Set up Cloud Monitoring and Alerting: Configure Cloud Monitoring to collect and analyze logs related to instance deletion. Create custom metrics and alerts to proactively monitor and detect any unauthorized deletion events. Use the following GCP CLI command to create a custom metric:
  ```
  gcloud monitoring metrics create [METRIC_NAME] --description=[DESCRIPTION] --display-name=[DISPLAY_NAME] --metric-kind=GAUGE --value-type=INT64
  ```

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized deletion:
- Implement strong authentication and access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have access to the API and the ability to delete instances. This can be achieved by using IAM roles and permissions to restrict access to the v1.compute.instances.delete method.
- Enable audit logging: Enable Cloud Audit Logs to capture all API calls, including deletions. This will provide a detailed record of who performed the deletion and when it occurred. You can use the `google-cloud-logging` library in Python to retrieve and analyze the audit logs.

2. Lack of access controls:
- Implement least privilege access: Follow the principle of least privilege and grant only the necessary permissions to users or service accounts. Restrict access to the v1.compute.instances.delete method to only those who require it.
- Regularly review and update access controls: Conduct periodic reviews of access controls to ensure that they are up to date and aligned with the principle of least privilege. Use the `google-cloud-iam` library in Python to programmatically manage IAM policies and permissions.

3. Insufficient logging and monitoring:
- Enable Stackdriver Logging and Monitoring: Stackdriver provides comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities for GCP resources. Enable logging for Compute Engine and set up alerts and notifications for any deletions of instances. You can use the `google-cloud-logging` library in Python to interact with Stackdriver Logging.
- Implement anomaly detection: Utilize anomaly detection mechanisms, such as Cloud Monitoring's anomaly detection feature, to identify unusual deletion patterns or suspicious activities. This can help proactively detect and respond to unauthorized deletions. Use the `google-cloud-monitoring` library in Python to configure anomaly detection policies.
