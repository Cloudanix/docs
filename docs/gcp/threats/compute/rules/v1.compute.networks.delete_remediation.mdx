### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The v1.compute.networks.delete event in GCP for Compute indicates that a network has been deleted in the Google Cloud Platform's Compute Engine service.
2. This event signifies that all resources associated with the network, such as subnets, firewall rules, and routes, have been removed.
3. It is important to note that deleting a network is a permanent action and cannot be undone, so it should be done with caution and after ensuring that there are no dependencies or active resources relying on the network.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with v1.compute.networks.delete in GCP for Compute, it means that an unauthorized user or process has the ability to delete networks in the GCP Compute Engine. This can lead to disruption of network connectivity and potential data loss.

- Remediation steps using GCP console:
  1. Access the GCP console and navigate to the Compute Engine section.
  2. Select the project and the specific network that needs to be protected.
  3. Click on the "Permissions" tab and review the existing IAM roles assigned to users or service accounts.
  4. Identify any users or service accounts with the "compute.networks.delete" permission and remove it if it is not necessary for their role.
  5. If the permission is required for certain users or service accounts, ensure that they have the necessary level of trust and restrict the permission to only those who need it.
  6. Regularly review and audit the IAM roles and permissions to ensure that they are aligned with the principle of least privilege and follow the security best practices.

Note: It is important to regularly monitor and review the IAM roles and permissions to prevent unauthorized access and potential security risks.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with v1.compute.networks.delete in GCP for Compute, it means that an attacker can delete a network in GCP Compute, potentially disrupting network connectivity and compromising the security of the resources within that network.

- Remediation: To remediate this security issue for GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

  1. Grant the necessary permissions: Ensure that the user or service account executing the CLI commands has the required permissions to manage networks and compute resources in GCP. This can be done by assigning the appropriate roles (e.g., Compute Network Admin) to the user or service account.

  2. Enable VPC Service Controls: VPC Service Controls provide additional security by allowing you to define a security perimeter around your resources. By enabling VPC Service Controls, you can prevent the deletion of networks from outside the defined perimeter. To enable VPC Service Controls, use the following CLI command:

     ```
     gcloud services vpc-peerings update --service=servicenetworking.googleapis.com --network=projects/[PROJECT_ID]/global/networks/[NETWORK_NAME] --update-peering
     ```

  3. Implement IAM policies: Use IAM policies to control access to the v1.compute.networks.delete method. By properly configuring IAM policies, you can restrict the execution of this method to only authorized users or service accounts. For example, you can create a custom IAM role with the necessary permissions and assign it to specific users or service accounts. To create a custom IAM role, use the following CLI command:

     ```
     gcloud iam roles create [ROLE_ID] --project=[PROJECT_ID] --title="[ROLE_TITLE]" --description="[ROLE_DESCRIPTION]" --permissions=[PERMISSIONS]
     ```

     Once the custom IAM role is created, you can assign it to users or service accounts using the IAM console or the following CLI command:

     ```
     gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=[MEMBER] --role=projects/[PROJECT_ID]/roles/[ROLE_ID]
     ```

     Replace the placeholders ([PROJECT_ID], [NETWORK_NAME], [ROLE_ID], [ROLE_TITLE], [ROLE_DESCRIPTION], [PERMISSIONS], [MEMBER]) with the appropriate values specific to your environment.

#### Using Python

- Example: If security is impacted with v1.compute.networks.delete in GCP Compute, it means that an attacker can delete a network, potentially disrupting network connectivity and compromising the security of the resources within that network.
- Remediation: To remediate this issue in GCP Compute using Python, you can implement the following steps:
  1. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary permissions to delete networks. Restricting the delete permission to only trusted individuals or automated processes can help mitigate the risk.
  2. Implement monitoring and alerting: Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect any unauthorized or suspicious network deletion activities. This can be achieved by leveraging GCP's Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging services.
  3. Implement network backup and recovery: Regularly backup your network configurations and settings to enable quick recovery in case of accidental or malicious network deletions. You can use GCP's Deployment Manager or Terraform to automate the backup and recovery process.

Python script example to restrict network deletion permissions using the Google Cloud Python SDK:

```python
from googleapiclient import discovery
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials

# Authenticate using Application Default Credentials
credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
service = discovery.build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)

# Set the project and network name
project = 'your-project-id'
network = 'your-network-name'

# Get the IAM policy for the network
policy = service.networks().getIamPolicy(project=project, resource=network).execute()

# Remove the 'compute.networks.delete' permission from all members
for binding in policy['bindings']:
    if binding['role'] == 'roles/compute.networkAdmin':
        if 'compute.networks.delete' in binding['members']:
            binding['members'].remove('compute.networks.delete')

# Update the IAM policy for the network
request = service.networks().setIamPolicy(project=project, resource=network, body={'policy': policy})
response = request.execute()

print('Network deletion permissions restricted successfully.')
```

Please note that this script assumes you have the necessary permissions to modify IAM policies for the network. Adjust the project and network variables accordingly.
