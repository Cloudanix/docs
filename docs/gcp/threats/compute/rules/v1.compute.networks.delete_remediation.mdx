### Event Information

- The v1.compute.networks.delete event in GCP for Compute refers to the deletion of a network resource within the Compute Engine service.
- This event indicates that a network, which is a logical grouping of resources within GCP, has been permanently removed from the Compute Engine.
- When this event occurs, it is important to ensure that any associated resources, such as instances or firewall rules, are also updated or deleted accordingly to avoid any disruptions in the network configuration.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of a network: If security is impacted with v1.compute.networks.delete in GCP for Compute, it could potentially allow an unauthorized user to delete a network. This could lead to disruption of network connectivity for instances and services relying on that network, resulting in a potential security breach or service outage.

2. Data loss or exposure: Deleting a network without proper authorization and understanding of the dependencies can result in data loss or exposure. Instances or services that were connected to the deleted network may lose access to critical data or expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties.

3. Disruption of network segmentation: Networks in GCP are often used to segment resources and enforce security boundaries. Deleting a network without proper planning and understanding of the network architecture can lead to the loss of network segmentation, potentially allowing unauthorized access to resources that were previously isolated. This can compromise the overall security posture of the environment.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion of a network in GCP Compute using the GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Limit IAM permissions: Review and update the IAM permissions for users and service accounts to ensure that only authorized individuals have the necessary permissions to delete networks. Remove the "compute.networks.delete" permission from any accounts that do not require it.

2. Enable VPC Service Controls: VPC Service Controls provide an additional layer of security by allowing you to define a security perimeter around your resources. Enable VPC Service Controls for your project and configure the appropriate service perimeters to prevent unauthorized deletion of networks.

3. Implement network deletion approval process: Set up a process where network deletions require approval from designated individuals or teams. This can be done by creating a custom workflow or using a change management system. This ensures that network deletions are properly reviewed and authorized before they are executed.

By implementing these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized network deletions and ensure the security and availability of your GCP Compute resources.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate unauthorized deletion of a network in GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:
   - Identify the network that was deleted by checking the audit logs or monitoring tools.
   - Restore the deleted network by recreating it with the same configuration and settings.
   - Reconnect the affected instances and services to the restored network using the appropriate commands or APIs.

   CLI commands:
   - To create a network: `gcloud compute networks create [NETWORK_NAME] --project=[PROJECT_ID] --subnet-mode=[SUBNET_MODE]`
   - To connect instances to a network: `gcloud compute instances add-network-interfaces [INSTANCE_NAME] --network=[NETWORK_NAME] --zone=[ZONE]`

2. To remediate data loss or exposure caused by unauthorized network deletion in GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can take the following actions:
   - Identify the affected instances and services that lost access to critical data or exposed sensitive information.
   - Restore the connectivity and data access by reconnecting the instances and services to the appropriate network or creating a new network if necessary.
   - Implement proper access controls and permissions to prevent unauthorized deletion of networks in the future.

   CLI commands:
   - To create a new network: `gcloud compute networks create [NETWORK_NAME] --project=[PROJECT_ID] --subnet-mode=[SUBNET_MODE]`
   - To connect instances to a network: `gcloud compute instances add-network-interfaces [INSTANCE_NAME] --network=[NETWORK_NAME] --zone=[ZONE]`

3. To remediate the disruption of network segmentation caused by unauthorized network deletion in GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can take the following steps:
   - Identify the resources and services that were affected by the loss of network segmentation.
   - Restore the network segmentation by recreating the deleted network or reconfiguring the existing network to enforce proper security boundaries.
   - Verify and update the access controls and firewall rules to ensure that resources are isolated and protected.

   CLI commands:
   - To create a network: `gcloud compute networks create [NETWORK_NAME] --project=[PROJECT_ID] --subnet-mode=[SUBNET_MODE]`
   - To configure firewall rules: `gcloud compute firewall-rules create [FIREWALL_RULE_NAME] --project=[PROJECT_ID] --network=[NETWORK_NAME] --allow=[ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS/PORTS]`

#### Using Python

1. To remediate unauthorized deletion of a network in GCP Compute using Python, you can implement the following steps:
   - Implement proper access controls and permissions to restrict the deletion of networks to authorized users only.
   - Regularly monitor and audit network deletion events using Cloud Audit Logs or Stackdriver Logging to detect any unauthorized attempts.
   - Set up alerts or notifications to notify administrators when a network deletion event occurs, allowing them to take immediate action.

   Python script example:
   ```python
   from google.cloud import logging_v2

   def check_network_deletion_logs(project_id):
       client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
       parent = f"projects/{project_id}"
       filter_str = 'protoPayload.methodName="v1.compute.networks.delete"'
       response = client.list_log_entries(
           request={"resourceNames": [parent], "filter": filter_str}
       )
       for entry in response:
           # Perform necessary actions to remediate the unauthorized deletion
           print(entry)

   check_network_deletion_logs("your-project-id")
   ```

2. To remediate data loss or exposure due to unauthorized network deletion in GCP Compute using Python, you can follow these steps:
   - Implement proper backup and disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure critical data is regularly backed up and can be restored in case of accidental deletion.
   - Use resource tagging or metadata to track dependencies between instances and networks, allowing you to identify potential data loss risks before deleting a network.
   - Implement network deletion approval workflows or automated checks to prevent accidental deletion without proper authorization.

   Python script example:
   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1

   def check_network_dependencies(project_id, network_name):
       client = compute_v1.NetworksClient()
       network_path = f"projects/{project_id}/global/networks/{network_name}"
       response = client.get(request={"project": project_id, "network": network_path})
       # Check for dependencies and take necessary actions to prevent data loss

   check_network_dependencies("your-project-id", "your-network-name")
   ```

3. To remediate the disruption of network segmentation caused by unauthorized network deletion in GCP Compute using Python, consider the following steps:
   - Implement proper network architecture planning and documentation to understand the dependencies and relationships between networks and resources.
   - Use network peering or firewall rules to enforce network segmentation and restrict unauthorized access between resources.
   - Regularly review and validate network configurations to ensure proper segmentation is maintained and unauthorized changes are detected.

   Python script example:
   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1

   def validate_network_segmentation(project_id, network_name):
       client = compute_v1.NetworksClient()
       network_path = f"projects/{project_id}/global/networks/{network_name}"
       response = client.get(request={"project": project_id, "network": network_path})
       # Validate network segmentation and take necessary actions to restore if compromised

   validate_network_segmentation("your-project-id", "your-network-name")
   ```
