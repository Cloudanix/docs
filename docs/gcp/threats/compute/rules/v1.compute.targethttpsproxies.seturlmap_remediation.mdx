### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setUrlMap event in GCP for Compute refers to an action taken to set the URL map for a target HTTPS proxy.
- This event occurs when there is a change in the URL map configuration for a target HTTPS proxy in GCP Compute Engine.
- It indicates that the URL map, which defines the routing rules for incoming HTTPS requests, has been updated for a specific target HTTPS proxy.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setUrlMap in GCP for Compute, it means that an unauthorized user or entity has the ability to modify the URL map associated with a target HTTPS proxy. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access or redirection of traffic to malicious destinations.

- Remediation Steps using GCP Console:
  1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
  2. Navigate to the Compute Engine section.
  3. Select the project and region where the affected target HTTPS proxy is located.
  4. In the left navigation menu, click on "Network services" and then "Load balancing".
  5. Click on "Target HTTPS proxies" to view the list of target HTTPS proxies in the selected project and region.
  6. Identify the target HTTPS proxy that needs to be remediated and click on its name to open its details.
  7. In the target HTTPS proxy details page, click on the "Edit" button.
  8. Scroll down to the "Backend configuration" section and review the URL map configuration.
  9. Ensure that only authorized users or entities have the necessary permissions to modify the URL map associated with the target HTTPS proxy.
  10. If needed, update the permissions or access controls to restrict unauthorized modifications.
  11. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes and remediate the security impact.

Note: It is recommended to regularly review and audit the permissions and access controls for target HTTPS proxies in GCP Compute to ensure security and prevent unauthorized modifications.

#### Using CLI

- The security impact of v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setUrlMap in GCP Compute is that it allows an attacker to modify the URL map associated with a target HTTPS proxy, potentially redirecting traffic to unauthorized destinations.
- To remediate this security issue in GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:
  1. Identify the affected target HTTPS proxy by listing all the target HTTPS proxies in your project:
     ```
     gcloud compute target-https-proxies list
     ```
  2. Update the URL map associated with the target HTTPS proxy to a secure and authorized destination using the `gcloud` command:
     ```
     gcloud compute target-https-proxies update [TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY_NAME] --url-map=[NEW_URL_MAP]
     ```
     Replace `[TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY_NAME]` with the name of the affected target HTTPS proxy and `[NEW_URL_MAP]` with the name of the secure and authorized URL map.
  3. Verify that the URL map has been successfully updated by checking the details of the target HTTPS proxy:
     ```
     gcloud compute target-https-proxies describe [TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY_NAME]
     ```
     Ensure that the `urlMap` field reflects the updated URL map.

Note: It is important to regularly monitor and review the configuration of target HTTPS proxies to ensure that they are not vulnerable to unauthorized modifications.

#### Using Python

1. Example of security impact with v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setUrlMap in GCP Compute:
   - If the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setUrlMap API is misconfigured or misused, it can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access to sensitive resources or exposure of sensitive data.

2. Remediation for GCP Compute using Python:
   - To remediate the security impact of v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setUrlMap in GCP Compute using Python, you can follow these steps:
     1. First, ensure that you have the necessary authentication credentials set up to interact with the GCP Compute API using Python. This can be done by creating a service account and generating a JSON key file.
     2. Install the required Python client library for GCP Compute, which is the `google-cloud-compute` library. You can install it using pip:
        ```
        pip install google-cloud-compute
        ```
     3. Write a Python script to update the target HTTPS proxy's URL map configuration. Here's an example script:
        ```python
        from google.cloud import compute_v1

        def update_target_https_proxy(project_id, target_https_proxy_name, url_map_name):
            compute_client = compute_v1.TargetHttpsProxiesClient()

            target_https_proxy_path = compute_client.target_https_proxy_path(
                project_id, target_https_proxy_name
            )

            url_map_path = compute_client.url_map_path(project_id, url_map_name)

            target_https_proxy = compute_v1.TargetHttpsProxy(
                url_map=url_map_path
            )

            request = compute_v1.SetUrlMapTargetHttpsProxyRequest(
                target_https_proxy=target_https_proxy
            )

            response = compute_client.set_url_map(
                request=request, target_https_proxy=target_https_proxy_path
            )

            print("Target HTTPS proxy URL map updated successfully.")

        # Usage example
        project_id = "your-project-id"
        target_https_proxy_name = "your-target-https-proxy-name"
        url_map_name = "your-url-map-name"

        update_target_https_proxy(project_id, target_https_proxy_name, url_map_name)
        ```
     4. Replace the placeholders in the script with your actual project ID, target HTTPS proxy name, and URL map name.
     5. Run the Python script, and it will update the target HTTPS proxy's URL map configuration accordingly.

   Note: This is a basic example, and you may need to modify the script based on your specific requirements and the structure of your GCP Compute environment.
