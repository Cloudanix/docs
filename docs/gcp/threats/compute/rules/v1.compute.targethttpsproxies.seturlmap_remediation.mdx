### Event Information

- The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setUrlMap event in GCP for Compute refers to an action taken to set the URL map for a target HTTPS proxy.
- This event occurs when there is a change in the URL map configuration for a target HTTPS proxy in GCP Compute Engine.
- It indicates that the URL map, which defines the routing rules for incoming HTTPS requests, has been updated for a specific target HTTPS proxy.


### Examples

1. Misconfiguration of URL mapping: If the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setUrlMap API is used incorrectly, it can lead to misconfiguration of URL mapping, which can impact security. For example, if the wrong URL map is set for a target HTTPS proxy, it can result in traffic being directed to the wrong backend service or resource, potentially exposing sensitive data or allowing unauthorized access.

2. Insecure URL mapping: If the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setUrlMap API is used to set an insecure URL mapping, it can impact security. For instance, if the URL map allows HTTP traffic instead of HTTPS, it can expose sensitive information transmitted over the network to potential eavesdropping or interception.

3. Lack of access controls: If proper access controls are not implemented when using the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setUrlMap API, it can impact security. For example, if unauthorized users or entities are granted permission to modify the URL map, they can potentially redirect traffic to malicious or unauthorized resources, leading to data breaches or service disruptions. It is crucial to ensure that only authorized individuals or systems have the necessary permissions to modify URL mappings.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Misconfiguration of URL mapping:
- Access the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
- Navigate to the Compute Engine section.
- Select "Target HTTPS Proxies" from the left-hand menu.
- Identify the target HTTPS proxy that needs remediation.
- Click on the target HTTPS proxy to open its details.
- Review the current URL map configuration.
- If misconfiguration is detected, click on the "Edit" button.
- Update the URL map to ensure the correct mapping is specified and HTTPS traffic is properly handled.
- Save the changes and verify that the URL mapping is now correctly configured.

2. Insecure URL redirection:
- Access the GCP Console.
- Navigate to the Compute Engine section.
- Select "Target HTTPS Proxies" from the left-hand menu.
- Identify the target HTTPS proxy that includes insecure URL redirection rules.
- Click on the target HTTPS proxy to open its details.
- Review the URL map configuration.
- If insecure URL redirection rules are found, click on the "Edit" button.
- Update the URL map to ensure that HTTPS traffic is not redirected to insecure HTTP endpoints.
- Save the changes and verify that the URL redirection is now secure.

3. Lack of access controls:
- Access the GCP Console.
- Navigate to the Compute Engine section.
- Select "Target HTTPS Proxies" from the left-hand menu.
- Identify the target HTTPS proxy that lacks proper access controls.
- Click on the target HTTPS proxy to open its details.
- Review the access control settings.
- If access controls are missing or improperly configured, click on the "Edit" button.
- Update the access controls to ensure that only authorized users have access to the API.
- Save the changes and verify that the access controls are now properly enforced.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate misconfiguration of URL mapping in GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:
   - Use the `gcloud compute target-https-proxies set-url-map` command to set the correct URL map for the target HTTPS proxy.
   - Ensure that the URL map is properly configured to handle HTTPS traffic by specifying the correct backend service or backend bucket.
   - Verify that the URL map is configured to only allow authorized access and does not expose sensitive information.

2. To remediate insecure URL redirection in GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can take the following actions:
   - Use the `gcloud compute target-https-proxies set-url-map` command to update the URL map with secure URL redirection rules.
   - Ensure that the URL map redirects HTTPS traffic to secure HTTPS endpoints instead of insecure HTTP endpoints.
   - Regularly review and update the URL map to prevent any insecure redirection rules that may compromise the security of the communication channel.

3. To remediate the lack of access controls in GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can implement the following measures:
   - Restrict access to the `gcloud compute target-https-proxies set-url-map` command by granting appropriate IAM permissions only to authorized users or service accounts.
   - Regularly review and audit the IAM permissions to ensure that only necessary permissions are granted for modifying the URL map.
   - Implement least privilege principles by granting the minimum required permissions to avoid unauthorized modifications to the URL map.

#### Using Python

1. Misconfiguration of URL mapping:
- Validate the URL map configuration before applying it using the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setUrlMap API.
- Use the appropriate URL map that is intended for the specific HTTPS traffic requirements.
- Ensure that the URL map is properly configured to handle HTTPS traffic, including SSL certificates and appropriate routing rules.

2. Insecure URL redirection:
- Review the URL map configuration specified in the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setUrlMap API to identify any insecure URL redirection rules.
- Update the URL map to redirect HTTPS traffic to secure HTTPS endpoints only.
- Implement proper security measures, such as SSL/TLS certificates, to ensure secure communication channels.

3. Lack of access controls:
- Implement proper access controls for the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setUrlMap API to restrict unauthorized access.
- Use IAM roles and permissions to control who can modify the URL map configuration.
- Regularly review and audit the access controls to ensure they are properly enforced and aligned with the principle of least privilege.

Python script example for GCP Compute using the google-cloud-python library:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def update_url_map(project_id, target_https_proxy, url_map):
    compute_client = compute_v1.TargetHttpsProxiesClient()

    target_https_proxy_url = f"projects/{project_id}/global/targetHttpsProxies/{target_https_proxy}"
    url_map_url = f"projects/{project_id}/global/urlMaps/{url_map}"

    request = compute_v1.SetUrlMapTargetHttpsProxyRequest(
        target_https_proxy=target_https_proxy_url,
        url_map=url_map_url
    )

    response = compute_client.set_url_map(request=request)
    print(f"URL map updated for Target HTTPS Proxy: {response.target_https_proxy}")

# Usage example
update_url_map("my-project", "my-target-https-proxy", "my-url-map")
```

Note: Make sure to authenticate the script using appropriate credentials and provide the necessary project ID, target HTTPS proxy, and URL map values.
