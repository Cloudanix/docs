### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setQuicOverride event in gcprealtime for Compute refers to a modification made to the QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) override setting for a target HTTPS proxy in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

2. This event indicates that a change has been made to the QUIC override configuration for a specific target HTTPS proxy, which allows for enabling or disabling QUIC protocol support for the proxy.

3. By modifying the QUIC override setting, it is possible to control whether QUIC protocol is used for communication between clients and the target HTTPS proxy, providing flexibility in optimizing network performance and security for applications using HTTPS.

#### Example

1. Impact on Security: The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setQuicOverride event in GCP Realtime for Compute can potentially impact security by enabling or disabling the QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol for target HTTPS proxies. If this event is triggered without proper authorization or validation, it can lead to security vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access, data leakage, or denial of service attacks.

2. Example: An attacker gains unauthorized access to the GCP project and executes the following command to disable QUIC override for a target HTTPS proxy:

```
gcloud compute target-https-proxies update [TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY_NAME] --no-quic-override
```

This command disables the QUIC protocol for the specified target HTTPS proxy, which can impact security if QUIC was previously enabled for performance or security reasons.

3. Remediation: To remediate the security impact caused by the v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setQuicOverride event, follow these steps:

- Regularly monitor and review audit logs for any unauthorized or suspicious activity.
- Implement strict access controls and permissions to prevent unauthorized access to GCP resources.
- Enable VPC Service Controls to restrict access to sensitive resources and prevent unauthorized changes.
- Implement continuous security monitoring and intrusion detection systems to detect and respond to any security incidents promptly.
- Regularly update and patch GCP resources to ensure they are protected against known vulnerabilities.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts to add an extra layer of security.
- Regularly review and update firewall rules to restrict access to only necessary ports and protocols.
- Educate and train users on best practices for securing GCP resources and detecting potential security threats.
