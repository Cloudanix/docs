### Event Information

- The v1.compute.targetHttpsProxies.setSslPolicy event in GCP for Compute refers to an action taken to set the SSL policy for a target HTTPS proxy.
- This event indicates that a change has been made to the SSL policy associated with a target HTTPS proxy in GCP's Compute Engine.
- The SSL policy determines the level of security and encryption protocols that are enforced for HTTPS traffic handled by the target HTTPS proxy.


### Examples

1. Insecure SSL/TLS configuration: If the SSL policy set for the target HTTPS proxy in GCP Compute is not properly configured, it can lead to insecure SSL/TLS connections. This can result in potential security vulnerabilities, such as man-in-the-middle attacks or unauthorized access to sensitive data transmitted over the network.

2. Weak cipher suites: If the SSL policy allows the use of weak cipher suites, it can weaken the security of the SSL/TLS connections established through the target HTTPS proxy. Attackers may be able to exploit vulnerabilities in these weak cipher suites to decrypt or tamper with the encrypted data.

3. Outdated SSL/TLS protocols: If the SSL policy allows the use of outdated SSL/TLS protocols, such as SSLv3 or TLS 1.0, it can expose the target HTTPS proxy to known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass encryption or launch attacks like POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) that target weak SSL/TLS protocols.

To mitigate these security impacts, it is important to ensure that the SSL policy set for the target HTTPS proxy in GCP Compute follows best practices, such as enforcing strong cipher suites, disabling weak protocols, and regularly updating the SSL/TLS configuration to address any emerging security vulnerabilities. Regular security assessments and audits should also be conducted to identify and remediate any potential security issues.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Insecure SSL/TLS configuration:
- Access the GCP Console and navigate to the Compute Engine section.
- Select the appropriate project and go to the "HTTPS Load Balancing" page.
- Locate the target HTTPS proxy that needs to be remediated and click on its name.
- In the SSL policies section, click on the "Edit" button.
- Review the SSL policy configuration and ensure that it follows best practices for secure SSL/TLS connections.
- Make necessary changes to the SSL policy, such as enabling strong cipher suites and disabling insecure protocols.
- Save the changes and verify that the SSL/TLS configuration is now secure.

2. Weak cipher suites:
- Access the GCP Console and navigate to the Compute Engine section.
- Select the appropriate project and go to the "HTTPS Load Balancing" page.
- Locate the target HTTPS proxy that needs to be remediated and click on its name.
- In the SSL policies section, click on the "Edit" button.
- Review the list of cipher suites allowed by the SSL policy.
- Remove any weak cipher suites from the list and ensure that only strong and secure cipher suites are enabled.
- Save the changes and verify that the SSL/TLS configuration now only allows strong cipher suites.

3. Outdated SSL/TLS protocols:
- Access the GCP Console and navigate to the Compute Engine section.
- Select the appropriate project and go to the "HTTPS Load Balancing" page.
- Locate the target HTTPS proxy that needs to be remediated and click on its name.
- In the SSL policies section, click on the "Edit" button.
- Review the list of SSL/TLS protocols allowed by the SSL policy.
- Disable any outdated protocols, such as SSLv3 or TLS 1.0, and ensure that only modern and secure protocols are enabled.
- Save the changes and verify that the SSL/TLS configuration now only allows secure and up-to-date protocols.

#### Using CLI

1. Insecure SSL/TLS configuration:
- Identify the target HTTPS proxy that has an insecure SSL/TLS configuration.
- Update the SSL policy for the target HTTPS proxy to enforce secure SSL/TLS configurations.
- Use the following GCP CLI command to update the SSL policy:
  `gcloud compute ssl-policies update [SSL_POLICY_NAME] --profile=MODERN`

2. Weak cipher suites:
- Identify the target HTTPS proxy that allows the use of weak cipher suites.
- Update the SSL policy for the target HTTPS proxy to disable weak cipher suites.
- Use the following GCP CLI command to update the SSL policy:
  `gcloud compute ssl-policies update [SSL_POLICY_NAME] --profile=MODERN --min-tls-version=TLS_1_2`

3. Outdated SSL/TLS protocols:
- Identify the target HTTPS proxy that allows the use of outdated SSL/TLS protocols.
- Update the SSL policy for the target HTTPS proxy to disable outdated SSL/TLS protocols.
- Use the following GCP CLI command to update the SSL policy:
  `gcloud compute ssl-policies update [SSL_POLICY_NAME] --profile=MODERN --min-tls-version=TLS_1_2`

#### Using Python

1. Insecure SSL/TLS configuration:
- Use the GCP Compute API to retrieve the current SSL policy configuration for the target HTTPS proxy.
- Validate the SSL policy settings against best practices and security standards.
- If any insecure configurations are found, update the SSL policy using the GCP Compute API to enforce secure SSL/TLS connections.

2. Weak cipher suites:
- Use the GCP Compute API to retrieve the current SSL policy configuration for the target HTTPS proxy.
- Identify the weak cipher suites allowed by the SSL policy.
- Update the SSL policy using the GCP Compute API to remove or disable the weak cipher suites and enforce the use of stronger cipher suites.

3. Outdated SSL/TLS protocols:
- Use the GCP Compute API to retrieve the current SSL policy configuration for the target HTTPS proxy.
- Check if any outdated SSL/TLS protocols (e.g., SSLv3, TLS 1.0) are allowed by the SSL policy.
- Update the SSL policy using the GCP Compute API to disable the use of outdated protocols and enforce the use of more secure protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher).

Please note that providing complete Python scripts within the response is not possible due to the character limitations. However, you can refer to the official GCP Compute API documentation and use the relevant Python libraries (such as google-api-python-client) to interact with the API and implement the necessary changes in your Python script.
