### Event Information

- The v1.compute.targetSslProxies.delete event in GCP for Compute refers to the deletion of a target SSL proxy resource.
- This event indicates that a target SSL proxy, which is responsible for terminating SSL/TLS connections for a specific target HTTPS proxy, has been deleted.
- When this event occurs, any existing SSL certificates associated with the target SSL proxy will also be removed.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of target SSL proxies: If security is impacted with v1.compute.targetSslProxies.delete in GCP for Compute, it could potentially allow unauthorized individuals to delete target SSL proxies. This could lead to a loss of secure communication between clients and backend services, potentially exposing sensitive data or allowing for unauthorized access.

2. Disruption of SSL/TLS termination: Deleting target SSL proxies without proper authorization could disrupt the SSL/TLS termination process for incoming traffic. This could result in a loss of secure communication and potentially expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties.

3. Service availability and reliability: In some cases, deleting target SSL proxies without proper planning or coordination could lead to service disruptions or downtime. This can impact the availability and reliability of applications and services relying on SSL/TLS termination, potentially causing financial losses or reputational damage.

It is important to ensure that proper access controls, authentication mechanisms, and monitoring are in place to prevent unauthorized deletion of target SSL proxies in GCP Compute. Regular audits and reviews of access permissions should be conducted to mitigate the risk of security incidents.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the unauthorized deletion of target SSL proxies in GCP Compute using the GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete target SSL proxies. Review and update the IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies to restrict access to sensitive resources.

2. Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for Compute Engine API calls to track any unauthorized deletion attempts. This will help in identifying and investigating any suspicious activities related to target SSL proxies.

3. Implement resource backup and recovery: Regularly backup the configuration of target SSL proxies to ensure that they can be restored in case of accidental deletion. This can be done by exporting the proxy configuration using the GCP console or using the gcloud command-line tool.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletion of target SSL proxies, prevent service disruption, and ensure the security and availability of your backend services.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the unauthorized deletion of target SSL proxies in GCP Compute, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete target SSL proxies. This can be achieved by assigning appropriate IAM roles to users or service accounts.

2. Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for Compute Engine API operations, including targetSslProxies.delete. This will allow you to track and monitor any unauthorized deletion attempts and take appropriate action.

3. Regularly review and monitor activity logs: Regularly review the activity logs for Compute Engine API operations, specifically focusing on targetSslProxies.delete. This will help you identify any suspicious or unauthorized deletion activities and take immediate action to mitigate the risk.

CLI commands for GCP Compute:

To assign IAM roles to a user or service account:
```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=[MEMBER] --role=[ROLE]
```

To enable audit logging for Compute Engine API operations:
```
gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME] --log-filter='resource.type="gce_target_ssl_proxies" protoPayload.methodName="v1.compute.targetSslProxies.delete"'
```

To review activity logs for Compute Engine API operations:
```
gcloud logging read 'resource.type="gce_target_ssl_proxies" protoPayload.methodName="v1.compute.targetSslProxies.delete"' --project=[PROJECT_ID]
```

#### Using Python

To remediate unauthorized deletion of target SSL proxies in GCP Compute using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete target SSL proxies. This can be done by properly configuring IAM roles and permissions for the users or service accounts interacting with the GCP Compute API.

2. Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for the GCP Compute API to track any deletion events related to target SSL proxies. This will help in identifying unauthorized deletion attempts and provide an audit trail for investigation.

3. Implement automation and monitoring: Utilize Python scripts to automate the monitoring and detection of unauthorized deletion events. You can periodically check the audit logs for any suspicious activity and trigger alerts or notifications when unauthorized deletion attempts are detected. Additionally, you can leverage the GCP Monitoring API to create custom metrics and alerts for proactive monitoring of target SSL proxies.

Here's an example Python script using the Google Cloud Client Library to retrieve the audit logs for target SSL proxies:

```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2

def get_audit_logs(project_id, filter_str):
    client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
    parent = client.project_path(project_id)
    logs = client.list_log_entries(
        request={"parent": parent, "filter": filter_str}
    )
    for log in logs:
        print(log)

# Usage
project_id = "your-project-id"
filter_str = 'resource.type="gce_target_ssl_proxies" AND protoPayload.methodName="v1.compute.targetSslProxies.delete"'
get_audit_logs(project_id, filter_str)
```

This script retrieves the audit logs for target SSL proxies in the specified GCP project, filtering for deletion events. You can customize the filter string based on your specific requirements.

Please note that this is just an example and you may need to adapt it to your specific environment and requirements.
