### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The v1.compute.backendServices.deleteSignedUrlKey event in GCP for Compute indicates that a signed URL key has been deleted for a backend service.
2. This event is triggered when a signed URL key, which is used for secure access to resources behind a backend service, is removed from the configuration.
3. It is important to monitor this event as it can help track changes in the access control configuration for backend services and ensure the security of the resources.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- The v1.compute.backendServices.deleteSignedUrlKey API in GCP Compute allows the deletion of a signed URL key for a backend service. If security is impacted, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access or disruption of services.

To remediate this issue for GCP Compute using the GCP console, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to the GCP Console (https://console.cloud.google.com) with appropriate credentials.
2. Navigate to the Compute Engine section by clicking on the menu icon in the top-left corner and selecting "Compute Engine" under the "Compute" section.
3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Backend services" to view the list of backend services in your project.
4. Identify the backend service for which you want to remediate the security issue.
5. Click on the name of the backend service to open its details page.
6. In the details page, click on the "Security" tab.
7. Scroll down to the "Signed URL keys" section and locate the key that needs to be deleted.
8. Click on the three-dot menu icon next to the key and select "Delete" from the dropdown menu.
9. Confirm the deletion by clicking on the "Delete" button in the confirmation dialog.
10. Repeat steps 7-9 for any other keys that need to be deleted.
11. Once all the necessary keys have been deleted, verify that the security issue has been remediated by reviewing the backend service's security settings.

By following these steps, you can remediate the security impact of the v1.compute.backendServices.deleteSignedUrlKey API in GCP Compute using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

- The `v1.compute.backendServices.deleteSignedUrlKey` API in GCP Compute allows for the deletion of a signed URL key associated with a backend service. If security is impacted, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access to resources or services.

To remediate this issue for GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected backend service: Use the `gcloud compute backend-services list` command to list all the backend services in your project.

2. Remove the signed URL key: Once you have identified the affected backend service, use the `gcloud compute backend-services update` command to remove the signed URL key. Specify the `--signed-url-key` flag with the key name to be deleted, and set it to an empty string. For example:
   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services update [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --signed-url-key=""
   ```

3. Verify the changes: After executing the update command, use the `gcloud compute backend-services describe` command to verify that the signed URL key has been successfully removed. For example:
   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]
   ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the security impact of the `v1.compute.backendServices.deleteSignedUrlKey` API in GCP Compute using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

1. Impact on Security: The v1.compute.backendServices.deleteSignedUrlKey API in GCP Compute allows the deletion of a signed URL key for a backend service. If security is impacted, it means that an unauthorized user or a malicious actor could potentially delete a signed URL key, leading to a potential breach in the security of the backend service.

2. Remediation for GCP Compute using Python: To remediate this security impact, you can implement proper access controls and authentication mechanisms in your GCP Compute environment. Here's an example of how you can use the Python client library to delete a signed URL key for a backend service:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def delete_signed_url_key(project_id, backend_service_name, key_name):
    compute_client = compute_v1.BackendServicesClient()

    backend_service_path = compute_client.backend_service_path(project_id, backend_service_name)
    key_path = compute_client.signed_url_key_path(project_id, backend_service_name, key_name)

    compute_client.delete_signed_url_key(request={"backend_service": backend_service_path, "key": key_path})

# Usage example
project_id = "your-project-id"
backend_service_name = "your-backend-service-name"
key_name = "your-key-name"

delete_signed_url_key(project_id, backend_service_name, key_name)
```

Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions and authentication set up to execute this script successfully.
