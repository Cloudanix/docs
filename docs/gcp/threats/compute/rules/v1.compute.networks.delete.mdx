### Event Information

- The v1.compute.networks.delete event in GCP for Compute refers to the deletion of a network resource within the Compute Engine service.
- This event indicates that a network, which is a logical grouping of resources, has been permanently removed from the GCP project.
- The deletion of a network can have significant implications on the connectivity and communication between virtual machine instances within the project.


### Examples

- Unauthorized deletion of a network: If security is impacted with v1.compute.networks.delete in GCP for Compute, it could potentially allow unauthorized users to delete a network. This could lead to disruption of network connectivity and potential data loss or unauthorized access to resources within the network.

- Network misconfiguration: Deleting a network without proper planning and coordination can result in misconfiguration of the network environment. This can lead to security vulnerabilities such as exposing sensitive resources to the public internet or creating network segmentation issues that allow unauthorized access between different parts of the network.

- Impact on dependent resources: Deleting a network can have a cascading effect on other resources that depend on it. For example, if virtual machines or other compute instances are attached to the network being deleted, they will lose network connectivity and may become inaccessible. This can impact the availability and security of the affected resources.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issues mentioned in the previous response for GCP Compute using the GCP console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Restricting SSH access:
   - Go to the GCP Console and navigate to the Compute Engine section.
   - Select the instance for which you want to restrict SSH access.
   - Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
   - Scroll down to the "Firewalls" section and click on "Add firewall rule".
   - Provide a name for the firewall rule and set the "Targets" to "All instances in the network".
   - In the "Source IP ranges" field, enter the IP range from which you want to allow SSH access (e.g., your organization's IP range).
   - Set the "Protocols and ports" to allow SSH (port 22) traffic.
   - Click on the "Create" button to save the firewall rule.

2. Enabling VPC Flow Logs:
   - Go to the GCP Console and navigate to the VPC Network section.
   - Select the VPC network for which you want to enable flow logs.
   - Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
   - Scroll down to the "Flow logs" section and click on "Add flow log".
   - Provide a name for the flow log and select the desired configuration options (e.g., sampling rate, metadata inclusion).
   - Choose the desired destination for the flow logs (e.g., Stackdriver Logging, Cloud Storage).
   - Click on the "Create" button to enable flow logs for the VPC network.

3. Implementing IAM best practices:
   - Go to the GCP Console and navigate to the IAM & Admin section.
   - Select the project for which you want to implement IAM best practices.
   - Click on the "IAM" tab to view the IAM roles and permissions.
   - Review the existing IAM roles and identify any unnecessary or overly permissive roles.
   - Remove any unnecessary roles and adjust the permissions of existing roles to follow the principle of least privilege.
   - Consider creating custom IAM roles with specific permissions tailored to the needs of different user groups.
   - Regularly review and audit the IAM roles and permissions to ensure they align with the organization's security requirements.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issues mentioned in the previous response for GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Disable SSH access for the default service account:
   - Use the following command to get the email address of the default service account:
     ```
     gcloud iam service-accounts list --filter="displayName:Compute Engine default service account"
     ```
   - Once you have the email address, use the following command to remove the roles associated with SSH access:
     ```
     gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member=serviceAccount:EMAIL_ADDRESS --role=roles/compute.osLogin
     ```

2. Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring:
   - Use the following command to enable VPC Flow Logs for a specific subnet:
     ```
     gcloud compute networks subnets update SUBNET_NAME --region=REGION --enable-flow-logs
     ```

3. Restrict public access to Cloud Storage buckets:
   - Use the following command to update the bucket ACL and remove all public access:
     ```
     gsutil iam ch allUsers:legacyObjectReader gs://BUCKET_NAME
     ```

Please note that you need to replace the placeholders (PROJECT_ID, EMAIL_ADDRESS, SUBNET_NAME, REGION, and BUCKET_NAME) with the actual values specific to your GCP environment.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issues mentioned in the previous response for GCP Compute using Python, you can use the following approaches:

1. Enforce strong password policies:
   - Use the Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) API to create a custom password policy for GCP Compute instances.
   - Write a Python script that utilizes the IAM API to enforce password complexity requirements, such as minimum length, special characters, and regular password rotation.

2. Enable disk encryption:
   - Use the Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API to create and manage encryption keys.
   - Write a Python script that utilizes the KMS API to enable disk encryption for GCP Compute instances. This script can be used to encrypt existing unencrypted disks or to ensure that new disks are automatically encrypted upon creation.

3. Implement network security groups:
   - Use the Google Cloud Firewall API to create and manage network security groups for GCP Compute instances.
   - Write a Python script that utilizes the Firewall API to define and enforce network access rules, such as allowing only specific IP ranges or protocols to access the instances. This script can be used to create and update firewall rules for Compute instances.
