### Event Information

- The v1.compute.networks.delete event in GCP for Compute refers to the deletion of a network resource within the Compute Engine service.
- This event indicates that a network, which is a logical grouping of resources within GCP, has been permanently removed from the Compute Engine.
- When this event occurs, it is important to ensure that any associated resources, such as instances or firewall rules, are also updated or deleted accordingly to avoid any disruptions in the network configuration.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion of a network: If security is impacted with v1.compute.networks.delete in GCP for Compute, it could potentially allow an unauthorized user to delete a network. This could lead to disruption of network connectivity for instances and services relying on that network, resulting in a potential security breach or service outage.

2. Data loss or exposure: Deleting a network without proper authorization and understanding of the dependencies can result in data loss or exposure. Instances or services that were connected to the deleted network may lose access to critical data or expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties.

3. Disruption of network segmentation: Networks in GCP are often used to segment resources and enforce security boundaries. Deleting a network without proper planning and understanding of the network architecture can lead to the loss of network segmentation, potentially allowing unauthorized access to resources that were previously isolated. This can compromise the overall security posture of the environment.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion of a network in GCP Compute using the GCP console, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement IAM (Identity and Access Management) controls:
   - Ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary permissions to delete networks.
   - Review and update the IAM policies to restrict the v1.compute.networks.delete permission to trusted individuals or groups.
   - Regularly audit and monitor the IAM policies to identify any unauthorized changes.

2. Enable resource-level logging and monitoring:
   - Enable Cloud Audit Logs to track and log all network deletion activities.
   - Set up alerts or notifications to be triggered whenever a network deletion event occurs.
   - Regularly review the logs and investigate any suspicious or unauthorized deletion attempts.

3. Implement network backup and recovery mechanisms:
   - Regularly backup the network configurations, including firewall rules, routes, and subnets.
   - Store the backups in a secure location, separate from the production environment.
   - Develop a documented recovery plan to restore the network in case of accidental or unauthorized deletion.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized network deletion, minimize the impact on network connectivity and data loss, and maintain proper network segmentation and access controls.

#### Using CLI

1. To remediate unauthorized deletion of a network in GCP Compute, follow these steps using GCP CLI commands:

- Identify the affected network by checking the logs or monitoring alerts.
- Immediately revoke the user's access privileges who performed the unauthorized deletion.
- Restore the deleted network using the `gcloud` command-line tool with the appropriate parameters, such as network name, subnet configuration, and firewall rules. For example:
  ```
  gcloud compute networks create [NETWORK_NAME] --subnet-mode=auto
  ```

2. To remediate data loss or exposure caused by deleting a network in GCP Compute, take the following actions:

- Identify the impacted instances or services that were relying on the deleted network.
- If possible, restore the deleted network using the steps mentioned in the previous point.
- If restoration is not feasible, recreate the network and associated resources, ensuring that proper precautions are taken to secure sensitive data.
- Implement data backup and recovery mechanisms to prevent data loss in the future.

3. To mitigate the impact on network segmentation and access controls due to the deletion of a network in GCP Compute, consider the following steps:

- Review and update the network architecture to ensure proper segmentation and access controls are in place.
- Implement network monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect any unauthorized access or changes to network configurations.
- Regularly review and audit network configurations to identify any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.
- Implement network security best practices, such as using VPC Service Controls, firewall rules, and IAM roles, to enforce proper access controls and prevent unauthorized access.

#### Using Python

1. To remediate unauthorized deletion of a network in GCP Compute using Python scripts, you can implement the following steps:
   - Implement proper access controls and permissions: Ensure that only authorized users or roles have the necessary permissions to delete networks. Use IAM roles and policies to restrict access to the v1.compute.networks.delete API.
   - Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for network deletion events. This will allow you to track and monitor any unauthorized deletion attempts. You can use the `google-cloud-logging` library in Python to retrieve and analyze the audit logs.
   - Implement network deletion confirmation: Add an additional step of confirmation before deleting a network. This can be done by adding a prompt or confirmation dialog in your Python script to ensure that the deletion is intentional.

2. To mitigate the risk of data loss or exposure when deleting a network in GCP Compute using Python scripts, consider the following measures:
   - Backup and restore procedures: Before deleting a network, ensure that you have proper backup procedures in place to safeguard sensitive data. This can involve taking snapshots of instances or services running on the network and storing them in a separate location.
   - Data encryption: Implement data encryption for sensitive data stored within instances or services. This can provide an additional layer of protection in case of accidental deletion or unauthorized access.
   - Test deletion in non-production environments: Before deleting a network in a production environment, perform thorough testing in non-production environments to identify any potential data loss or exposure risks. This can help you identify and address any issues before they impact critical data.

3. To minimize the impact on network segmentation and access controls when deleting a network in GCP Compute using Python scripts, consider the following steps:
   - Plan network architecture carefully: Before deleting a network, ensure that you have a well-designed network architecture that properly segregates different environments or applications. This can involve using subnets, firewall rules, and VPC peering to enforce proper segmentation.
   - Validate dependencies: Identify and validate any dependencies on the network being deleted. This can include checking for instances, services, or resources that rely on the network. Update the configuration of these resources to use alternative networks or architectures before deleting the network.
   - Implement change management processes: Establish change management processes to ensure that network deletions are properly planned, reviewed, and approved. This can involve using version control systems, code reviews, and documentation to track and manage network changes.
