### Event Information

- The v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete event in GCP for Compute indicates that a target HTTP proxy has been deleted.
- This event signifies that the specified target HTTP proxy resource no longer exists in the GCP environment.
- It is important to note that deleting a target HTTP proxy may impact the routing and load balancing configuration for HTTP(S) traffic in the GCP environment.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete in GCP for Compute, it could potentially allow unauthorized users or malicious actors to delete target HTTP proxies. This could lead to disruption of traffic routing and potential denial of service attacks.

2. Misconfiguration: If security is impacted with v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete in GCP for Compute, it could be due to misconfiguration of access controls. If the necessary permissions are not properly configured, it may allow unauthorized users to delete target HTTP proxies, compromising the security of the environment.

3. Lack of audit trail: If security is impacted with v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete in GCP for Compute, it may result in a lack of audit trail for the deletion activity. Without proper logging and monitoring, it becomes difficult to track and investigate any unauthorized or malicious deletion of target HTTP proxies, hindering incident response and forensic analysis.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issues mentioned in the previous response for GCP Compute using the GCP console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Restricting SSH access:
   - Go to the GCP Console and navigate to the Compute Engine section.
   - Select the instance for which you want to restrict SSH access.
   - Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
   - Scroll down to the "Firewalls" section and click on "Add firewall rule".
   - Provide a name for the firewall rule and set the "Targets" to "All instances in the network".
   - In the "Source IP ranges" field, enter the IP range from which you want to allow SSH access (e.g., your organization's IP range).
   - Set the "Protocols and ports" to allow SSH (port 22) traffic.
   - Click on the "Create" button to save the firewall rule.

2. Enabling VPC Flow Logs:
   - Go to the GCP Console and navigate to the VPC Network section.
   - Select the VPC network for which you want to enable flow logs.
   - Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
   - Scroll down to the "Flow logs" section and click on "Add flow log".
   - Provide a name for the flow log and select the desired configuration options (e.g., sampling rate, metadata inclusion).
   - Choose the desired destination for the flow logs (e.g., Stackdriver Logging, Cloud Storage).
   - Click on the "Create" button to enable flow logs for the VPC network.

3. Implementing IAM best practices:
   - Go to the GCP Console and navigate to the IAM & Admin section.
   - Select the project for which you want to implement IAM best practices.
   - Click on the "IAM" tab to view the IAM roles and permissions.
   - Review the existing IAM roles and identify any unnecessary or overly permissive roles.
   - Remove any unnecessary roles and update the permissions of existing roles to follow the principle of least privilege.
   - Consider creating custom IAM roles with specific permissions tailored to the needs of different user groups.
   - Regularly review and audit the IAM roles and permissions to ensure they align with the least privilege principle and organizational requirements.

#### Using CLI

1. Enable VPC Flow Logs for GCP Compute instances:
   - Use the following command to enable VPC Flow Logs for a specific subnet:
     ```
     gcloud compute networks subnets update [SUBNET_NAME] --enable-flow-logs
     ```

2. Restrict SSH access to GCP Compute instances:
   - Create a firewall rule to allow SSH access only from specific IP ranges using the following command:
     ```
     gcloud compute firewall-rules create [FIREWALL_RULE_NAME] --allow tcp:22 --source-ranges [IP_RANGE]
     ```

3. Implement disk encryption for GCP Compute instances:
   - Create a new disk with encryption enabled using the following command:
     ```
     gcloud compute disks create [DISK_NAME] --size [DISK_SIZE] --type [DISK_TYPE] --encryption-key [KEY_NAME]
     ```
   - Attach the encrypted disk to the instance using the following command:
     ```
     gcloud compute instances attach-disk [INSTANCE_NAME] --disk [DISK_NAME]
     ```

#### Using Python

To remediate the issues mentioned in the previous response for GCP Compute using Python, you can use the following approaches:

1. Enforce strong passwords:
   - Use the Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) API to create a custom role with the necessary permissions to manage user accounts.
   - Write a Python script that utilizes the IAM API to enforce strong password policies for GCP Compute instances.
   - The script should iterate through all the instances and update the passwords for each user account, ensuring they meet the required complexity criteria.

2. Enable disk encryption:
   - Use the Google Cloud Disk Encryption API to enable disk encryption for GCP Compute instances.
   - Write a Python script that utilizes the Disk Encryption API to enable encryption for all the disks attached to the instances.
   - The script should iterate through all the instances and enable encryption for each disk, ensuring data at rest is protected.

3. Implement network security groups:
   - Use the Google Cloud VPC Firewall API to create network security groups for GCP Compute instances.
   - Write a Python script that utilizes the VPC Firewall API to define and apply firewall rules to restrict inbound and outbound traffic.
   - The script should iterate through all the instances and configure the appropriate firewall rules based on the desired network security policies.

Please note that the actual implementation of these scripts may vary based on your specific requirements and the Python libraries you choose to use.
