### Event Information

#### Meaning

1. The v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete event in GCP for Compute indicates that a target HTTP proxy has been deleted in the specified project.
2. This event signifies that any traffic previously routed through the deleted target HTTP proxy will no longer be processed by it.
3. It is important to review the reason for the deletion and ensure that any necessary configurations or replacements are made to avoid disruption to the application or service relying on the target HTTP proxy.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete in GCP for Compute, it means that an attacker can delete target HTTP proxies, which can disrupt the traffic flow and potentially lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack on the application or service running on GCP Compute Engine.

- Remediation Steps using GCP Console:
  1. Sign in to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com) with your GCP account.
  2. Navigate to the Compute Engine section by clicking on the "Compute Engine" option in the left-hand menu.
  3. In the Compute Engine dashboard, select "Target HTTP Proxies" from the left-hand menu.
  4. Identify the target HTTP proxy that needs to be secured and click on its name to open its details.
  5. In the target HTTP proxy details page, click on the "Permissions" tab.
  6. Review the existing permissions and ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary roles to perform the v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete action.
  7. If any unauthorized users or service accounts have the delete permission, click on the "Edit" button to modify the permissions.
  8. Remove the delete permission from unauthorized users or service accounts by clicking on the "X" button next to their names.
  9. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes and secure the target HTTP proxy.
  10. Regularly monitor the permissions and audit logs to detect any unauthorized changes or access attempts.

Note: It is recommended to follow the principle of least privilege and grant delete permissions only to trusted individuals or service accounts who require it for their legitimate tasks.

#### Using CLI

1. Impact on Security: The v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete operation in GCP Compute allows for the deletion of target HTTP proxies. If security is impacted, it means that an unauthorized user or process can delete target HTTP proxies, potentially disrupting the traffic flow and compromising the availability of the associated services.

2. Remediation Steps using GCP CLI: To remediate this security impact in GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

   - Step 1: Identify the affected target HTTP proxy by listing all the target HTTP proxies in your project using the following command:
     ```
     gcloud compute target-http-proxies list
     ```

   - Step 2: Once you have identified the target HTTP proxy that needs to be protected, you can update its IAM permissions to restrict the delete operation. Grant the necessary permissions only to authorized users or service accounts. For example, you can grant the `compute.targetHttpProxies.update` permission to a specific service account using the following command:
     ```
     gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] --role=roles/compute.targetHttpProxies.update
     ```

   - Step 3: Verify the updated IAM permissions by listing the IAM policy for the target HTTP proxy using the following command:
     ```
     gcloud compute target-http-proxies get-iam-policy [TARGET_HTTP_PROXY_NAME]
     ```

   By following these steps, you can remediate the security impact of the v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete operation in GCP Compute and ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary permissions to perform this operation.

#### Using Python

1. Impact on Security: The `v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete` API in GCP Compute allows for the deletion of target HTTP proxies. If security is impacted, an example scenario could be an unauthorized user gaining access to the API and deleting critical target HTTP proxies, resulting in service disruptions or unauthorized access to backend services.

2. Remediation Steps: To remediate this security impact in GCP Compute using Python, you can follow these steps:

   a. Implement Access Control: Ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary permissions to access and modify target HTTP proxies. Use IAM roles and permissions to restrict access to the `v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete` API.

   b. Enable Audit Logging: Enable audit logging for GCP Compute API calls, including the `v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete` operation. This will allow you to monitor and review any unauthorized or suspicious activities related to target HTTP proxies.

   c. Implement Monitoring and Alerting: Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect any unusual or unauthorized deletion activities related to target HTTP proxies. Use Cloud Monitoring or third-party tools to receive alerts and take immediate action if any security incidents occur.

Python Script Example:
```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def delete_target_http_proxy(project_id, target_http_proxy_name):
    compute_client = compute_v1.TargetHttpProxiesClient()

    target_http_proxy_path = compute_client.target_http_proxy_path(
        project_id, target_http_proxy_name
    )

    compute_client.delete(target_http_proxy_path)

# Usage example
project_id = "your-project-id"
target_http_proxy_name = "your-target-http-proxy-name"

delete_target_http_proxy(project_id, target_http_proxy_name)
```

Note: This example assumes that you have already set up the necessary authentication and authorization for the Python script to access the GCP Compute API.
