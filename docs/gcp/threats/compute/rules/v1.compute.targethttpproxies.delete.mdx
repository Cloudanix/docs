### Event Information

- The v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete event in GCP for Compute refers to the deletion of a target HTTP proxy resource.
- This event indicates that a target HTTP proxy, which is used to route HTTP or HTTPS traffic to a backend service, has been deleted.
- It is important to note that deleting a target HTTP proxy will result in the loss of any associated forwarding rules and URL maps, so it should be done with caution and after considering the impact on the overall application or service architecture.


### Examples

1. Unauthorized deletion: If security is impacted with v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete in GCP for Compute, one example could be an unauthorized user gaining access to the API and deleting target HTTP proxies. This could result in disruption of traffic routing and potential denial of service attacks.

2. Misconfiguration: Another example could be a misconfiguration in access controls or permissions, allowing users with lower privileges to delete target HTTP proxies. This could lead to accidental or intentional deletion of critical resources, impacting the security and availability of applications.

3. Lack of audit trail: If proper logging and monitoring mechanisms are not in place, it may be difficult to track and investigate any unauthorized or malicious deletion of target HTTP proxies. This lack of visibility can hinder incident response efforts and make it challenging to identify the root cause of security incidents.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate unauthorized deletion, misconfiguration, and lack of audit trail for GCP Compute using the GCP console, you can follow these steps:

1. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
   - Review and update the IAM roles and permissions assigned to users and service accounts.
   - Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary privileges to delete target HTTP proxies.
   - Regularly audit and update the access controls to prevent any misconfigurations.

2. Enable Audit Logging:
   - Enable Cloud Audit Logging for Compute Engine API activities.
   - Configure the logs to capture relevant events, including target HTTP proxy deletions.
   - Ensure that the logs are stored in a secure and centralized location for easy monitoring and analysis.

3. Set up Monitoring and Alerting:
   - Utilize Cloud Monitoring to set up custom metrics and alerts for target HTTP proxy deletions.
   - Define appropriate thresholds and notification mechanisms to promptly detect and respond to any unauthorized or suspicious activities.
   - Regularly review the monitoring data and investigate any alerts to identify and mitigate potential security incidents.

By implementing these steps, you can enhance the security posture of your GCP Compute environment, mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletions, and establish a robust audit trail for incident investigation and compliance purposes.

#### Using CLI

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of target HTTP proxies in GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can take the following steps:

- Implement strict access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete target HTTP proxies. Use IAM roles and permissions to restrict access to the v1.compute.targetHttpProxies.delete API.

- Enable audit logging: Enable Cloud Audit Logging to capture all API calls related to target HTTP proxies. This will provide an audit trail of any deletion attempts and help in identifying unauthorized access.

- Monitor and alert on deletion events: Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to notify you whenever a target HTTP proxy is deleted. This will allow you to respond quickly to any unauthorized deletion attempts.

2. Misconfiguration: To remediate misconfigurations in access controls or permissions for deleting target HTTP proxies in GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

- Review and update IAM policies: Regularly review and update IAM policies to ensure that only users with the appropriate privileges can delete target HTTP proxies. Remove any unnecessary or overly permissive roles or permissions.

- Implement least privilege principle: Follow the principle of least privilege and grant users the minimum permissions required to perform their tasks. Avoid granting delete permissions to users who do not need them.

- Regularly audit access controls: Conduct regular audits of access controls and permissions to identify any misconfigurations or inconsistencies. Use tools like the IAM Recommender to identify and fix any potential issues.

3. Lack of audit trail: To remediate the lack of audit trail for target HTTP proxy deletions in GCP Compute using GCP CLI, you can take the following actions:

- Enable Cloud Audit Logging: Enable Cloud Audit Logging for the Compute API to capture all API calls related to target HTTP proxies. This will provide a detailed audit trail of deletion events.

- Configure log retention: Set an appropriate log retention period to ensure that audit logs are retained for a sufficient duration. This will allow you to investigate past events and track any unauthorized deletions.

- Monitor audit logs: Regularly monitor the audit logs for any suspicious or unauthorized deletion events. Implement log analysis and alerting mechanisms to proactively detect and respond to any security incidents.

Please note that the specific CLI commands may vary based on your environment and requirements. It is recommended to refer to the official GCP documentation for the most up-to-date and accurate commands.

#### Using Python

1. Unauthorized deletion: To remediate unauthorized deletion of target HTTP proxies in GCP Compute using Python, you can implement the following steps:

- Implement proper access controls and permissions: Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to delete target HTTP proxies. You can use the Google Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management) API to manage and assign appropriate roles and permissions to users.

- Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for the Compute API in GCP. This will help you track and monitor any API calls related to target HTTP proxies. You can use the Google Cloud Logging API to retrieve and analyze the logs.

- Implement monitoring and alerting: Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect any unusual or unauthorized deletion activities. You can use the Google Cloud Monitoring API to create custom metrics and alerts based on specific deletion events.

2. Misconfiguration: To remediate misconfigurations in access controls or permissions for target HTTP proxies in GCP Compute using Python, you can follow these steps:

- Regularly review and update access controls: Conduct regular reviews of access controls and permissions to ensure that they are properly configured. You can use the Google Cloud IAM API to programmatically retrieve and update access control policies.

- Implement automated checks: Develop Python scripts that can perform automated checks on access controls and permissions for target HTTP proxies. These scripts can validate if the correct roles and permissions are assigned to users and alert you if any misconfigurations are detected.

- Implement version control and change management: Use version control systems to track and manage changes to access controls and permissions. This will help you identify any unauthorized or unintended changes and revert them if necessary.

3. Lack of audit trail: To remediate the lack of audit trail for target HTTP proxies in GCP Compute using Python, you can take the following steps:

- Enable Cloud Audit Logs: Enable Cloud Audit Logs for the Compute API in GCP. This will capture detailed information about API calls, including deletions of target HTTP proxies. You can use the Google Cloud Logging API to retrieve and analyze these logs programmatically.

- Implement centralized logging and monitoring: Set up a centralized logging and monitoring solution that aggregates logs from different GCP services, including Compute. This will provide a unified view of all relevant logs, making it easier to track and investigate any unauthorized or malicious deletions.

- Develop custom log analysis scripts: Write Python scripts that can parse and analyze the Cloud Audit Logs to identify any suspicious deletion activities. These scripts can help you automate the detection and investigation of security incidents related to target HTTP proxies.
