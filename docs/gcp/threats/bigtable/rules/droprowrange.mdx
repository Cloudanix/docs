Impact on Security: The `google.bigtable.admin.v2.BigtableTableAdmin.DropRowRange` event in GCP Realtime for Bigtable can potentially impact security if it is triggered without proper authorization or authentication. This event allows for the deletion of a range of rows within a Bigtable table, which can lead to data loss or unauthorized access if not handled correctly.

They could specify a wide range of rows to be deleted, effectively wiping out a significant portion of the table's data. This can result in data loss, disruption of services relying on the table, and potential exposure of sensitive information.

```
gcloud logging sinks create bigtable-audit-sink \
    bigtable.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/instances/[INSTANCE_ID] \
    --log-filter='resource.type="bigtable.googleapis.com/Table" protoPayload.methodName="google.bigtable.admin.v2.BigtableTableAdmin.DropRowRange"'
```

Note: Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` and `[INSTANCE_ID]` with the appropriate values for your GCP project and Bigtable instance.
