#### Using CLI

To remediate the issues mentioned in the previous response for GCP Bigtable using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Enable audit logging for GCP Bigtable:
   - Use the following command to enable audit logging for Bigtable:
     ```
     gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] bigtable.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/instances/[INSTANCE_ID] --log-filter='resource.type="bigtable_instance"'
     ```
   - Replace `[SINK_NAME]` with a name for the sink, `[PROJECT_ID]` with your GCP project ID, and `[INSTANCE_ID]` with the ID of your Bigtable instance.

2. Implement VPC Service Controls for Bigtable:
   - Create a VPC Service Controls perimeter for Bigtable using the following command:
     ```
     gcloud access-context-manager perimeters create [PERIMETER_NAME] --resources=bigtable.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/instances/[INSTANCE_ID] --restricted-services=bigtable.googleapis.com
     ```
   - Replace `[PERIMETER_NAME]` with a name for the perimeter.

3. Enable encryption at rest for Bigtable:
   - Use the following command to enable encryption at rest for Bigtable:
     ```
     gcloud beta bigtable instances update [INSTANCE_ID] --cluster=[CLUSTER_ID] --encryption-at-rest-state=ENABLED
     ```
   - Replace `[INSTANCE_ID]` with the ID of your Bigtable instance and `[CLUSTER_ID]` with the ID of your Bigtable cluster.

Note: Make sure to authenticate with the appropriate GCP credentials before running these commands.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issues mentioned in the previous response for GCP Bigtable using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Enable VPC Service Controls:
   - Use the `google-cloud-securitycenter` library to enable VPC Service Controls for your Bigtable instance.
   - Here's an example Python script to enable VPC Service Controls for Bigtable:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import securitycenter

   client = securitycenter.SecurityCenterClient()

   # Set the project ID and Bigtable instance ID
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   instance_id = 'your-bigtable-instance-id'

   # Enable VPC Service Controls for Bigtable
   response = client.update_service_account(
       name=f'projects/{project_id}/locations/global/services/bigtable.googleapis.com',
       service_account='your-service-account-email',
       project=project_id,
       instance=instance_id
   )

   print('VPC Service Controls enabled for Bigtable')
   ```

2. Implement IAM Roles and Permissions:
   - Use the `google-cloud-iam` library to assign appropriate IAM roles and permissions to control access to your Bigtable instance.
   - Here's an example Python script to assign IAM roles and permissions for Bigtable:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import iam

   client = iam.IAMClient()

   # Set the project ID and Bigtable instance ID
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   instance_id = 'your-bigtable-instance-id'

   # Assign IAM roles and permissions for Bigtable
   policy = client.get_iam_policy(request={'resource': f'projects/{project_id}/instances/{instance_id}'})
   policy.bindings.add(
       role='roles/bigtable.reader',
       members=['user:example@example.com']
   )
   policy.bindings.add(
       role='roles/bigtable.admin',
       members=['group:bigtable-admins@example.com']
   )
   client.set_iam_policy(request={'resource': f'projects/{project_id}/instances/{instance_id}', 'policy': policy})

   print('IAM roles and permissions assigned for Bigtable')
   ```

3. Implement Audit Logging:
   - Use the `google-cloud-logging` library to enable audit logging for your Bigtable instance.
   - Here's an example Python script to enable audit logging for Bigtable:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import logging_v2

   client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()

   # Set the project ID and Bigtable instance ID
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   instance_id = 'your-bigtable-instance-id'

   # Enable audit logging for Bigtable
   parent = client.project_path(project_id)
   client.create_sink(
       request={
           'parent': parent,
           'sink': {
               'name': f'projects/{project_id}/sinks/bigtable-audit-logs',
               'destination': f'bigtable.googleapis.com/projects/{project_id}/instances/{instance_id}',
               'filter': 'logName:"cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity"',
               'output_version_format': 'V2',
               'include_children': True
           }
       }
   )

   print('Audit logging enabled for Bigtable')
   ```

Please note that you need to replace `'your-project-id'`, `'your-bigtable-instance-id'`, `'your-service-account-email'`, `'user:example@example.com'`, and `'group:bigtable-admins@example.com'` with the actual values specific to your GCP project and Bigtable instance.
