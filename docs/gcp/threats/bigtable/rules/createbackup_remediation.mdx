#### Example

1. Impact on Security: The `google.bigtable.admin.v2.BigtableTableAdmin.CreateBackup` event in GCP Realtime for Bigtable can potentially impact security if proper access controls and permissions are not in place. If an unauthorized user gains access to create backups, they could potentially copy sensitive data or modify existing backups, leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.

Remediation:
- Implement IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies to restrict the creation of backups to only authorized users or service accounts.
- Regularly review and audit IAM policies to ensure that only necessary permissions are granted to users and service accounts.
- Enable audit logging for Bigtable to monitor and track backup creation activities. This can help in identifying any unauthorized or suspicious backup creation attempts.

Example CLI Command:
To restrict backup creation to specific users or service accounts, you can use the `gcloud` command-line tool to update the IAM policy for the Bigtable instance. For example, to grant backup creation permission to a specific service account, you can use the following command:

```
gcloud bigtable instances set-iam-policy INSTANCE_ID --member=serviceAccount:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL --role=roles/bigtable.backupAdmin
```

Replace `INSTANCE_ID` with the ID of your Bigtable instance and `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` with the email address of the service account that should have backup creation permissions.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to modify IAM policies for the Bigtable instance.
