### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The cloudsql.instances.delete event in gcprealtime for CloudSQL indicates that a Cloud SQL instance has been deleted in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment.
- This event signifies that the Cloud SQL instance and all its associated data, including databases and backups, have been permanently removed.
- It is important to note that this event is irreversible, and caution should be exercised before deleting a Cloud SQL instance to avoid data loss.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If an unauthorized user gains access to the gcprealtime event for CloudSQL and triggers the cloudsql.instances.delete event, it can lead to the deletion of a CloudSQL instance. This can result in the loss of critical data and disruption of services.

Remediation:
- Implement strict access controls: Ensure that only authorized users have access to the gcprealtime event and the ability to trigger the cloudsql.instances.delete event. Use IAM roles and permissions to control access.
- Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for CloudSQL instances to track any deletion events. This will help in identifying any unauthorized deletion attempts and take appropriate actions.
- Regular backups: Implement a regular backup strategy for your CloudSQL instances. This will help in restoring data in case of accidental or malicious deletion. Use the `gcloud sql backups create` command to create backups.

Example CLI commands:
- Granting access to gcprealtime event:
  ```
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member=serviceAccount:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL --role=roles/logging.logWriter
  ```
- Enabling audit logging for CloudSQL:
  ```
  gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME --enable-audit-log
  ```
- Creating a backup for CloudSQL:
  ```
  gcloud sql backups create --instance=INSTANCE_NAME --location=REGION
  ```
