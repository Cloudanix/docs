     ```
     gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME] --log-filter='resource.type="apigateway.googleapis.com/ApiConfig"'

   - Regularly backup API configurations to ensure quick recovery in case of accidental deletion or unauthorized access. This can be achieved by exporting the API configuration using the following gcloud command:
     ```
     gcloud api-gateway api-configs describe [API_CONFIG_ID] --api=[API_ID] --location=[LOCATION] --format=json > [BACKUP_FILE_PATH]
     ```
