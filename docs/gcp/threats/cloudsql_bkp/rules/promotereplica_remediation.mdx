### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The `cloudsql.instances.promoteReplica` event in GCP Realtime for CloudSQL refers to the event when a replica instance is promoted to become the new primary instance in a CloudSQL database cluster.
- This event is triggered when the user manually promotes a replica instance or when an automatic failover occurs due to a failure in the primary instance.
- The `promoteReplica` event is important as it signifies a change in the database's primary instance, which can impact the availability and functionality of the application relying on the database.

#### Example

1. Impact on Security: The `cloudsql.instances.promoteReplica` event in GCP Realtime for CloudSQL can potentially impact security if unauthorized access is gained to the replica instance during the promotion process. This can occur if proper access controls and security configurations are not in place.

- Ensure proper access controls: Implement IAM roles and permissions to restrict access to the replica instance. Grant only necessary privileges to authorized users or service accounts.
- Enable VPC Service Controls: Utilize VPC Service Controls to create a secure perimeter around your CloudSQL instances, preventing unauthorized access from outside the VPC network.
- Enable Private IP: Configure your CloudSQL instances to use Private IP, which ensures that the instances are only accessible within your VPC network and not exposed to the public internet.

Remediation:
To promote a replica instance in CloudSQL, you can use the `gcloud` command-line tool with the `sql instances promote-replica` command. Here's an example:

```bash
gcloud sql instances promote-replica [INSTANCE_NAME] --project=[PROJECT_ID] --zone=[ZONE]
```

Ensure that you replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]`, `[PROJECT_ID]`, and `[ZONE]` with the appropriate values for your environment.

By following the above recommendations and using the provided command, you can mitigate security risks associated with the `cloudsql.instances.promoteReplica` event in GCP Realtime for CloudSQL.
