### Event Information

- The `google.cloud.secretmanager.v1.SecretManagerService.DisableSecretVersion` event in GCP for SecretManager indicates that a specific version of a secret has been disabled.
- This event is triggered when a user or an automated process disables a secret version using the Secret Manager API or the Cloud Console.
- Disabling a secret version means that it can no longer be accessed or used by applications or services that rely on it, providing an additional layer of security and control over sensitive information.


### Examples

- Unauthorized access: Disabling a secret version without proper authorization can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information. This can occur if an attacker gains access to the credentials or permissions required to disable secret versions.
- Data loss: Disabling a secret version can result in the loss of access to the corresponding secret data. If the disabled version is the only available version, it may not be possible to retrieve the secret data, leading to potential data loss.
- Compliance violations: Disabling secret versions without proper documentation or justification can lead to compliance violations. Organizations may be required to maintain a history of secret versions for auditing purposes, and disabling versions without proper procedures can result in non-compliance.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

1. Identify the issue: Use the GCP console to navigate to the SecretManager service and identify the specific secret that needs to be remediated.

2. Update the secret: Select the secret and click on the "Edit" button. Update the secret value with a strong and secure value. Ensure that the new value meets the compliance standards and best practices for secret management.

3. Rotate the secret: If the secret has been compromised or if it is recommended to rotate secrets periodically, click on the "Rotate" button. This will generate a new version of the secret with a new value. Make sure to update any applications or services that use this secret with the new value to ensure uninterrupted functionality.

Note: It is important to follow any additional steps or guidelines provided by GCP or compliance standards specific to your organization while remediating the issue in GCP SecretManager.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issues related to GCP Secret Manager using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Enable Secret Manager API:
   - Run the following command to enable the Secret Manager API:
     ```
     gcloud services enable secretmanager.googleapis.com
     ```

2. Create a secret:
   - Use the following command to create a new secret:
     ```
     gcloud secrets create [SECRET_NAME] --replication-policy automatic
     ```

3. Add a secret version:
   - To add a new version to an existing secret, use the following command:
     ```
     gcloud secrets versions add [SECRET_NAME] --data-file=[PATH_TO_SECRET_FILE]
     ```

Note: Replace `[SECRET_NAME]` with the desired name for your secret, and `[PATH_TO_SECRET_FILE]` with the path to the file containing the secret data.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issues related to GCP Secret Manager using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Accessing a Secret:
   - Install the required Python client library using `pip install google-cloud-secret-manager`.
   - Import the necessary modules in your Python script:
     ```python
     from google.cloud import secretmanager
     ```
   - Create a client instance:
     ```python
     client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient()
     ```
   - Retrieve the secret value by specifying the project ID and secret ID:
     ```python
     project_id = 'your-project-id'
     secret_id = 'your-secret-id'
     response = client.access_secret_version(request={"name": f"projects/{project_id}/secrets/{secret_id}/versions/latest"})
     secret_value = response.payload.data.decode("UTF-8")
     ```

2. Creating a Secret:
   - Import the necessary modules:
     ```python
     from google.cloud import secretmanager
     ```
   - Create a client instance:
     ```python
     client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient()
     ```
   - Create a new secret by specifying the project ID and secret ID:
     ```python
     project_id = 'your-project-id'
     secret_id = 'your-secret-id'
     parent = f"projects/{project_id}"
     secret = {"replication": {"automatic": {}}}
     response = client.create_secret(request={"parent": parent, "secret_id": secret_id, "secret": secret})
     ```

3. Deleting a Secret:
   - Import the necessary modules:
     ```python
     from google.cloud import secretmanager
     ```
   - Create a client instance:
     ```python
     client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient()
     ```
   - Delete the secret by specifying the project ID and secret ID:
     ```python
     project_id = 'your-project-id'
     secret_id = 'your-secret-id'
     secret_name = f"projects/{project_id}/secrets/{secret_id}"
     response = client.delete_secret(request={"name": secret_name})
     ```

Please note that you need to replace `'your-project-id'` and `'your-secret-id'` with your actual project and secret IDs.
