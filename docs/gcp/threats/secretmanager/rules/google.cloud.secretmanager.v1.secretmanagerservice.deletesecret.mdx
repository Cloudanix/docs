### Event Information

#### Meaning

- The `google.cloud.secretmanager.v1.SecretManagerService.DeleteSecret` event in GCP for SecretManager indicates that a secret has been deleted from the Secret Manager service.
- This event signifies that the specified secret, along with its associated versions and metadata, has been permanently removed from the Secret Manager.
- It is important to note that this event does not trigger any additional actions or notifications by default, but it can be used for auditing purposes or to track the deletion of secrets in the Secret Manager service.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

- Example: If security is impacted with `google.cloud.secretmanager.v1.SecretManagerService.DeleteSecret` in GCP SecretManager, it means that an unauthorized user or process has the ability to delete secrets stored in SecretManager. This can lead to potential data loss or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

- Remediation Steps using GCP Console:
  1. Access the GCP Console and navigate to the SecretManager page.
  2. Identify the impacted secret that needs to be secured.
  3. Click on the secret to open its details page.
  4. In the details page, click on the "Permissions" tab.
  5. Review the existing permissions and ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary roles to delete secrets.
  6. If any unauthorized users or service accounts are listed, click on the "Edit" button.
  7. Remove the unnecessary roles or permissions from the unauthorized users or service accounts.
  8. Click on "Save" to apply the changes and restrict the ability to delete secrets to only authorized entities.
  9. Regularly monitor the permissions and access controls to ensure ongoing security and compliance.

#### Using CLI

- Example: If security is impacted with `google.cloud.secretmanager.v1.SecretManagerService.DeleteSecret` in GCP SecretManager, it means that an unauthorized user or process has the ability to delete secrets stored in SecretManager. This can lead to potential data loss or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

- Remediation steps for GCP SecretManager using GCP CLI:
  1. Grant appropriate permissions: Ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have the necessary permissions to delete secrets. This can be done by assigning the `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` or `roles/secretmanager.admin` role to the relevant identities.
  2. Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for SecretManager to track any deletion activities. This can be done by configuring the appropriate audit logs sink and filter in Cloud Logging.
  3. Implement access controls: Implement additional access controls such as VPC Service Controls or IAM conditions to restrict access to SecretManager resources based on specific conditions or network boundaries.

CLI commands:
- Granting permissions:
  ```
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=[MEMBER] --role=roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
  ```
  or
  ```
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=[MEMBER] --role=roles/secretmanager.admin
  ```

- Enabling audit logging:
  ```
  gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME] --log-filter='resource.type="secretmanager.googleapis.com/Secret" protoPayload.methodName="google.cloud.secretmanager.v1.SecretManagerService.DeleteSecret"'
  ```

- Implementing access controls:
  ```
  gcloud beta secret-manager secrets add-iam-policy-binding [SECRET_ID] --member=[MEMBER] --role=roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor --condition=[CONDITION]
  ```
  or
  ```
  gcloud beta secret-manager secrets add-iam-policy-binding [SECRET_ID] --member=[MEMBER] --role=roles/secretmanager.admin --condition=[CONDITION]
  ```

#### Using Python

- Example: If security is impacted with `google.cloud.secretmanager.v1.SecretManagerService.DeleteSecret` in GCP SecretManager, it means that an unauthorized user or process has the ability to delete secrets stored in SecretManager. This can lead to potential data loss or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

- Remediation Steps:
  1. Implement proper access controls: Ensure that only authorized users or processes have the necessary permissions to delete secrets. This can be achieved by using IAM roles and policies to restrict access to the `secretmanager.versions.delete` permission.
  2. Enable audit logging: Enable audit logging for SecretManager to track any deletion activities. This will help in identifying any unauthorized deletions and investigating security incidents.
  3. Implement monitoring and alerting: Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to notify the appropriate personnel whenever a secret deletion occurs. This will enable quick response and mitigation in case of any security incidents.

Python Script for Remediation:
```python
from google.cloud import secretmanager

def delete_secret(project_id, secret_id):
    client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient()
    secret_name = f"projects/{project_id}/secrets/{secret_id}"
    
    # Check if the user has the necessary permissions to delete the secret
    # Implement your own logic to validate the user's permissions
    
    # Delete the secret
    client.delete_secret(request={"name": secret_name})
    
    print(f"Secret '{secret_id}' deleted successfully.")

# Usage example
project_id = "your-project-id"
secret_id = "your-secret-id"
delete_secret(project_id, secret_id)
```
Please note that the above script is a basic example and you should implement additional security measures and error handling based on your specific requirements and environment.
