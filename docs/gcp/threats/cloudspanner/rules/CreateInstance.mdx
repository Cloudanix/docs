### Event Information

#### Meaning

- This event indicates that a user or an automated process has initiated the creation of a new Cloud Spanner instance, which is a container for databases within the Cloud Spanner service.

#### Example

1. Example of security impact: If the `google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.InstanceAdmin.CreateInstance` event in GCP Realtime for CloudSpanner is compromised, it could potentially lead to unauthorized creation of new Cloud Spanner instances. This could result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, data breaches, or resource abuse.

Remediation:
- Implement strict access controls: Ensure that only authorized personnel have the necessary permissions to create Cloud Spanner instances. Use IAM roles and policies to control access at the project, instance, and database levels.
- Enable audit logging: Enable Cloud Audit Logs for Cloud Spanner to track and monitor all instance creation activities. This will help in detecting any unauthorized or suspicious activities. You can enable audit logging using the following gcloud command:

  ```
  gcloud spanner instances update INSTANCE_ID --enable-audit-logging
  ```

- Implement VPC Service Controls: Use VPC Service Controls to create a secure perimeter around your Cloud Spanner resources. This helps prevent data exfiltration and unauthorized access even if an attacker gains access to the project.

Note: The specific remediation steps may vary depending on your specific use case and security requirements. It is recommended to consult the official GCP documentation and follow best practices for securing Cloud Spanner instances.
