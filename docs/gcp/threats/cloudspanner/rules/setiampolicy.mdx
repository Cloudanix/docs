#### Example

1. Impact on Security: The `google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.InstanceAdmin.SetIamPolicy` event in GCP Realtime for CloudSpanner can potentially impact security if unauthorized users gain access to modify the IAM policy of a CloudSpanner instance. This event allows users to set or update the IAM policy for an instance, which controls access to the instance and its resources.

They could potentially add their own account or elevate their permissions, bypassing existing security controls and gaining unauthorized access to the instance and its data.
