### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to the Load Balancer: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left corner), scroll down and click on "Network Services", then select "Load balancing".

3. Check the Backend Configuration: In the Load balancing page, select the load balancer you want to check. Click on the "Backend configuration" tab. Here, you can see the backend services and backend buckets. If the backend bucket is deleted, it will show "Not Found" or an error message.

4. Verify DNS Records: Go back to the navigation menu, scroll down and click on "Network Services", then select "Cloud DNS". Check the DNS records for the load balancer. If the storage bucket is deleted, the DNS record pointing to the bucket will not resolve correctly.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK (if not already done). You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, you can initialize it using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud init
   ```
2. After initializing the Google Cloud SDK, you can list all the load balancers in your project using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud compute url-maps list
   ```
   This command will list all the load balancers along with their details.

3. To check the backend services of a specific load balancer, use the following command:
   ```
   gcloud compute url-maps describe [LOAD_BALANCER_NAME]
   ```
   Replace `[LOAD_BALANCER_NAME]` with the name of your load balancer. This command will display the details of the load balancer, including the backend services.

4. Now, you can check if the storage bucket associated with the backend service is deleted or not. For this, you can use the following command:
   ```
   gsutil ls gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
   ```
   Replace `[BUCKET_NAME]` with the name of your bucket. If the bucket is deleted, this command will return an error saying that the bucket does not exist.

#### Using Python

1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud Storage: Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud Storage. You can install the Python client using pip:

   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-storage
   ```

2. Authenticate with Google Cloud: Use the `gcloud auth application-default login` command to authenticate with Google Cloud.

3. Use the Python Client to Check the Existence of the Bucket: You can use the following Python script to check if a specific bucket exists:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import storage

   def check_bucket_exists(bucket_name):
       """Check if a bucket exists in Google Cloud Storage."""
       storage_client = storage.Client()
       bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
       if bucket.exists():
           print("Bucket {} exists.".format(bucket_name))
       else:
           print("Bucket {} does not exist.".format(bucket_name))

   # Replace 'my-bucket' with your bucket name
   check_bucket_exists('my-bucket')
   ```

4. Check DNS Records: If the bucket does not exist, you should check the DNS records for the load balancer. You can use the `google.cloud.dns` module to list all DNS records and check if there is a record that points to the deleted bucket. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import dns

   def check_dns_records():
       """Check DNS records in Google Cloud DNS."""
       dns_client = dns.Client()
       zones = dns_client.list_zones()
       for zone in zones:
           records = zone.list_resource_record_sets()
           for record in records:
               if 'my-bucket' in record.rrdatas:
                   print("Found DNS record pointing to deleted bucket: {}".format(record))

   check_dns_records()
   ```
   
Remember to replace 'my-bucket' with the name of your bucket. If the script finds a DNS record that points to the deleted bucket, it means that the load balancer is misconfigured.

3. In the Cloud DNS dashboard, locate the affected DNS zone and click on its name to open its details.

4. In the DNS zone details, you will see a list of DNS records associated with that zone. Identify the record that was pointing to the deleted Load Balancer Storage Bucket.

5. Click on the checkbox next to the record to select it.

6. At the top of the DNS zone details page, click on the "Edit" button to enter the edit mode.

7. In the edit mode, locate the record that was pointing to the deleted Load Balancer Storage Bucket and delete it by clicking on the trash bin icon next to it.

8. Once the record is deleted, click on the "Add Record Set" button to add a new record.

9. In the "Add Record Set" form, provide the necessary details to recreate the record:

   - Type: Select the appropriate record type (e.g., A, CNAME, etc.) based on your requirements.
   - Name: Enter the name of the record (e.g., subdomain.example.com).
   - TTL (optional): Set the desired Time-to-Live value for the record.
   - Data: Enter the destination IP address or hostname for the record.

10. After entering the required details, click on the "Create" button to add the new record.

11. Verify that the new record has been successfully added to the DNS zone.

12. Repeat steps 8-11 if you have multiple records that need to be recreated.
