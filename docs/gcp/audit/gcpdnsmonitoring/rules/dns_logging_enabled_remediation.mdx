### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, visit the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in with your GCP account credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud DNS: From the GCP Console dashboard, select "Navigation Menu" (three horizontal lines located in the upper left-hand corner of the console). Scroll down and click on "Network Services" and then select "Cloud DNS".

3. Check DNS Zones: Here, you will see a list of your DNS zones. Click on the name of the DNS zone you want to check.

4. Check Logging Status: In the DNS zone details page, look for the "Cloud DNS Logging" section. If the status is "Disabled", then logging is not enabled for this DNS zone. If it's "Enabled", then logging is active.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. This will provide you with the necessary command-line tools to interact with resources hosted on Google Cloud Platform.

2. Authenticate your SDK with GCP. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to log in with your Google account.

3. List all the DNS managed zones in your GCP project. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud dns managed-zones list
   ```
   This will return a list of all DNS managed zones in your project.

4. For each DNS managed zone, check if DNSSEC is enabled. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud dns managed-zones describe [ZONE_NAME]
   ```
   Replace `[ZONE_NAME]` with the name of the DNS managed zone. This will return a description of the DNS managed zone, including whether DNSSEC is enabled. If DNSSEC is not enabled, this is a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Google Cloud libraries are required to interact with GCP services. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-dns
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the client:

```python
from google.cloud import dns
client = dns.Client()
```

3. Fetch all the DNS policies in the project:

```python
policies = client.list_policies()
```

4. Check if logging is enabled for each policy:

```python
for policy in policies:
    if not policy.enable_logging:
        print(f"Logging is not enabled for policy: {policy.id}")
```

This script will print out the IDs of all DNS policies that do not have logging enabled. If no output is produced, then logging is enabled for all DNS policies.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of GCP DNS not having logging enabled, you can follow the below steps using the GCP console:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Cloud DNS page.
2. Select the DNS zone that needs to have logging enabled.
3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
4. In the "Logging" section, select the checkbox for "Log DNS queries".
5. Choose the destination for the logs. You can either select "Logs Explorer" or "Cloud Storage".
6. If you choose "Cloud Storage", provide the bucket name and folder path where the logs will be stored.
7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Once logging is enabled, DNS queries made to the DNS zone will be logged and can be viewed in the selected destination. This will help in identifying any potential security threats and troubleshooting DNS issues.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of GCP DNS not having logging enabled, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project that needs to be remediated.
2. Click on the Navigation menu and select "Logging" under the "Operations" section.
3. Click on the "Log Exports" tab and then click on the "Create Export" button.
4. In the "Create Export" window, select "Cloud Storage" as the sink destination.
5. Select the Cloud Storage bucket where you want to store the logs.
6. In the "Filter" section, select "Advanced Filter" and enter the following filter:

```
resource.type="dns_query"
```

7. Click on the "Create" button to create the export.
8. Now, go to the Cloud DNS page in the Google Cloud Console.
9. Click on the name of the DNS zone that needs to be remediated.
10. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
11. In the "Logging" section, select the "Export to Cloud Logging" checkbox.
12. Select the log export that was created in step 7 from the dropdown list.
13. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

With these steps, the misconfiguration of GCP DNS not having logging enabled has been remediated. Now, all DNS queries will be logged and exported to the specified Cloud Storage bucket.

#### Using Python

To remediate this misconfiguration, you can use the following steps in Python:

1. Import the required libraries:

```
from google.cloud import logging_v2
from google.cloud.logging_v2.types import LogMetric
from google.protobuf import duration_pb2
```

2. Set up the client for the GCP project:

```
client = logging_v2.MetricsServiceV2Client()
project_id = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
```

3. Define the log metric:

```
metric_name = "dns-logs"
metric_description = "DNS logs for GCP"
metric_filter = "resource.type=gce_instance AND logName=projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/logs/syslog AND textPayload: \"dns\""
metric_interval = duration_pb2.Duration(seconds=60)
metric = LogMetric(name=metric_name, description=metric_description, filter=metric_filter, interval=metric_interval)
```

4. Create the log metric:

```
response = client.create_log_metric(project_name, metric)
```

5. Verify that the log metric has been created:

```
print(f"Created metric {response.name}")
```

These steps will enable logging for DNS in GCP. You can modify the filter to include other log types as well.
