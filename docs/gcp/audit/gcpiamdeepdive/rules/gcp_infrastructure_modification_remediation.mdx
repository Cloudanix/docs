### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Principals with Infrastructure modification capabilities" in GCP GCPIAM using the GCP console, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Open the GCP Console by visiting the GCP Console URL (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Sign in to your GCP account using appropriate credentials.
3. In the GCP Console, navigate to the "IAM & Admin" section by clicking on the navigation menu on the top-left corner and selecting "IAM & Admin" under the "IAM" category.

4. In the "IAM & Admin" section, you will see a list of IAM roles and members. Identify the members or service accounts that have infrastructure modification capabilities and need to be remediated.

5. Click on the checkbox next to the member or service account that you want to modify to remove infrastructure modification capabilities.

6. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page to edit the selected member or service account's IAM role.

7. In the "Edit IAM" panel, you will see the current IAM role assigned to the member or service account. Click on the "X" button next to the existing role to remove it.

8. In the "Add members" field, type the email address of the member or service account that should have restricted access without infrastructure modification capabilities.

9. In the "Select a role" dropdown, select a role that aligns with the desired level of access for the member or service account. Make sure the selected role does not grant infrastructure modification capabilities.

10. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

11. Repeat steps 5-10 for each member or service account that needs to be remediated.

12. Review the updated IAM roles and members to ensure that the infrastructure modification capabilities have been removed.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of "Principals with Infrastructure modification capabilities" in GCP GCPIAM using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Principals with Infrastructure modification capabilities" in GCP GCPIAM using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Install and set up the Google Cloud SDK by following the instructions provided in the official documentation: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

2. Authenticate with your Google Cloud account by running the following command and following the on-screen instructions:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. Set the appropriate project ID where the misconfiguration exists by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
   ```

   Replace "PROJECT_ID" with the actual ID of your project.

4. List all the IAM bindings for your project by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID
   ```

   Replace "PROJECT_ID" with the actual ID of your project.

5. Identify the principal or user with infrastructure modification capabilities in the output of the previous command.

6. Remove the infrastructure modification capabilities from the identified principal by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member="user:EMAIL" --role="roles/ROLE"
   ```

   Replace "PROJECT_ID" with the actual ID of your project, "EMAIL" with the email address of the identified principal, and "ROLE" with the appropriate role that grants infrastructure modification capabilities.

   Note: Make sure to use the correct role that matches the misconfiguration. For example, if the principal has the "roles/owner" role, replace "roles/ROLE" with "roles/owner" in the command.

7. Confirm the removal of the principal's infrastructure modification capabilities by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID
   ```

   Verify that the identified principal no longer has the role that grants infrastructure modification capabilities.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration "Principals with Infrastructure modification capabilities" in GCP GCPIAM using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Principals with Infrastructure modification capabilities" in GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries:
   - Install the Google Cloud SDK by following the instructions provided by Google: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
   - Install the `google-cloud-iam` library by running the command: `pip install google-cloud-iam`

2. Authenticate with your GCP account:
   - Run the command `gcloud auth login` to authenticate with your GCP account. Follow the instructions in the command prompt to complete the authentication process.

3. Create a Python script:
   - Create a new Python script using your preferred IDE or text editor.

4. Import the necessary libraries:
   ```python
   from google.cloud import iam
   ```

5. Initialize the IAM client:
   ```python
   client = iam.IAMClient()
   ```

6. Retrieve the list of IAM policies for your project:
   ```python
   project_id = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
   policies = client.list_project_iam_policies(request={"resource": f"projects/{project_id}"})
   ```

7. Identify the principals with infrastructure modification capabilities:
   ```python
   for policy in policies:
       for binding in policy.bindings:
           if 'compute.' in binding.role or 'container.' in binding.role:
               print(f"Principal: {binding.members}, Role: {binding.role}")
   ```

8. Remove the infrastructure modification capabilities from the identified principals:
   ```python
   role_to_remove = 'ROLE_TO_REMOVE'
   for policy in policies:
       for binding in policy.bindings:
           if role_to_remove in binding.role:
               binding.members = [member for member in binding.members if 'compute.' not in member and 'container.' not in member]
   ```

9. Update the IAM policies with the modified bindings:
   ```python
   for policy in policies:
       client.set_iam_policy(request={"resource": f"projects/{project_id}", "policy": policy})
   ```

10. Save and run the Python script:
    - Save the Python script with a suitable name, e.g., `remediate_iam.py`.
    - Run the script using the command `python remediate_iam.py`.

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'` with your actual GCP project ID and `'ROLE_TO_REMOVE'` with the specific role you want to remove from the principals.

Note: This solution assumes you have the necessary permissions to modify IAM policies in your GCP project.
