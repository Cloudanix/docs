### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of users having Administrator Access in GCP IAM using the GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the GCP console (https://console.cloud.google.com) using your credentials.

2. Navigate to the IAM & Admin page by clicking on the "IAM & Admin" option in the left-hand side menu.

3. On the IAM & Admin page, you will see a list of all the users and their respective roles.

4. Identify the user(s) who have been granted the Administrator Access role.

5. Click on the checkbox next to the user(s) you want to modify.

6. Click on the "Remove" button at the top of the page to remove the selected user(s) from the Administrator Access role.

7. A confirmation dialog box will appear. Review the list of affected resources and ensure that you are removing the correct user(s). Click on the "Remove" button to proceed.

8. Once the user(s) have been removed from the Administrator Access role, they will no longer have unrestricted access to all resources in the GCP project.

9. It is recommended to assign more granular roles to these users based on their specific responsibilities and requirements.

10. To assign a new role, click on the "Add" button at the top of the page.

11. In the "Add members" field, enter the email address of the user you want to assign a role to.

12. Click on the "Select a role" dropdown menu and choose an appropriate role that aligns with the user's responsibilities.

13. Click on the "Save" button to assign the selected role to the user.

14. Repeat steps 11-13 for each user who needs to be assigned a new role.

By following these steps, you will successfully remediate the misconfiguration of users having Administrator Access in GCP IAM using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of users with Administrator Access in GCP GCPIAM using GCP CLI, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Open the command-line interface (CLI) tool for GCP.

2. Authenticate with your GCP account using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. Set the appropriate project where the misconfiguration exists by running the command:
   ```
   gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
   ```
   Replace "PROJECT_ID" with the actual ID of the project.

4. List all the users with Administrator Access in the GCP project by executing the command:
   ```
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID
   ```
   Replace "PROJECT_ID" with the actual ID of the project.

5. Identify the user(s) with Administrator Access that need to be remediated.

6. Remove the Administrator Access from the user(s) by executing the following command:
   ```
   gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member=user:USER_EMAIL --role=roles/editor
   ```
   Replace "PROJECT_ID" with the actual ID of the project, and "USER_EMAIL" with the email address of the user.

7. Confirm the removal by listing the IAM policy again using the command from step 4.

8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 for each user with Administrator Access that needs to be remediated.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration of users with Administrator Access in GCP GCPIAM using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of users with Administrator Access in GCP GCPIAM using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   - Install the Google Cloud SDK by following the instructions provided at: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install.
   - Install the Python client library for Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) using the command: `pip install google-cloud-iam`.

2. Authenticate with GCP:
   - Run the command `gcloud auth login` in your terminal and follow the authentication process to log in to your GCP account.

3. Create a Python script:
   - Create a new Python script using your preferred text editor.

4. Import the required libraries:
   - Add the following import statements at the beginning of your Python script:
     ```python
     from google.cloud import iam_v1
     from google.auth import exceptions
     ```

5. Define the project ID:
   - Set the project ID for your GCP project by assigning it to a variable in your Python script:
     ```python
     project_id = 'your-project-id'
     ```

6. Retrieve the list of users with Administrator Access:
   - Use the following code snippet to retrieve the list of users with Administrator Access:
     ```python
     def get_admin_users(project_id):
         client = iam_v1.IAMClient()
         resource_name = f'projects/{project_id}'
         try:
             response = client.query_grantable_roles(request={"fullResourceName": resource_name})
             admin_roles = [role for role in response]
             admin_users = []
             for role in admin_roles:
                 for member in role.role.bound_members:
                     if "user:" in member:
                         admin_users.append(member.split("user:")[1])
             return admin_users
         except exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError:
             print("Authentication failed. Please make sure you have authenticated with GCP.")
             return []

     admin_users = get_admin_users(project_id)
     ```

7. Remove Administrator Access for the identified users:
   - Use the following code snippet to remove Administrator Access for the identified users:
     ```python
     def remove_admin_access(project_id, user_emails):
         client = iam_v1.IAMClient()
         resource_name = f'projects/{project_id}'
         for email in user_emails:
             member = f'user:{email}'
             try:
                 policy = client.get_policy(request={"resource": resource_name})
                 bindings = policy.bindings
                 for binding in bindings:
                     if binding.role == "roles/owner":
                         if member in binding.members:
                             binding.members.remove(member)
                 policy.bindings = bindings
                 client.set_iam_policy(request={"resource": resource_name, "policy": policy})
                 print(f"Removed Administrator Access for user: {email}")
             except exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError:
                 print("Authentication failed. Please make sure you have authenticated with GCP.")

     remove_admin_access(project_id, admin_users)
     ```

8. Execute the Python script:
   - Save the Python script and execute it using the command `python script_name.py`.
   - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify IAM policies for the project.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration of users with Administrator Access in GCP GCPIAM using Python.
