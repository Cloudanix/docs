### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Login to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console: Open your browser and navigate to the GCP Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your credentials.

2. Navigate to Bigtable Instances: From the left-hand side menu, select "Bigtable" under the "STORAGE" section. This will take you to the Bigtable instances page where you can see all your Bigtable instances.

3. Check Encryption Settings: Click on the name of the Bigtable instance you want to check. This will open the instance details page. Here, look for the "Encryption" section. If the encryption is set to "Google-managed key", then it means that the Bigtable cluster is not encrypted with a customer-managed key.

4. Use Cloud Key Management Service (KMS): To confirm, you can also check the Cloud KMS. Navigate to "Security" > "Key Management" on the left-hand side menu. If there are no keys associated with your Bigtable instance, then it confirms that the Bigtable cluster is not encrypted with a customer-managed key.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine and authenticate it. You can download the SDK from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. After installation, you can authenticate the SDK using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. List all Bigtable instances: Use the following command to list all the Bigtable instances in your GCP project:

   ```
   gcloud bigtable instances list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all Bigtable instances along with their details.

3. Get the details of a Bigtable instance: To get the details of a specific Bigtable instance, use the following command:

   ```
   gcloud bigtable instances describe [INSTANCE_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_ID]` with the ID of the Bigtable instance you want to check. This command will return the details of the specified Bigtable instance, including the encryption settings.

4. Check the encryption settings: In the output of the previous command, look for the `encryptionInfo` field. If the `encryptionType` is set to `GOOGLE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION`, it means that the Bigtable instance is not encrypted with a customer-managed key. If the `encryptionType` is set to `CUSTOMER_MANAGED_ENCRYPTION`, it means that the Bigtable instance is encrypted with a customer-managed key.

#### Using Python

To check if a Bigtable Cluster is encrypted with Customer Managed Keys in No SQL using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set up Google Cloud SDK and authenticate your account:**
   Before you start, make sure you have the Google Cloud SDK installed and initialized on your system. You can authenticate your account using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   This will open a new browser window for you to log in to your Google account.

2. **Install the necessary Python libraries:**
   You will need the `google-cloud-bigtable` library to interact with Bigtable. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigtable
   ```

3. **Create a Python script to list all Bigtable clusters and their encryption settings:**
   Here is a sample script that does this:
   ```python
   from google.cloud import bigtable

   def list_clusters():
       client = bigtable.Client()
       for instance in client.list_instances():
           print(f'Instance: {instance.name}')
           for cluster in instance.list_clusters():
               print(f'  Cluster: {cluster.name}')
               print(f'  Encryption: {cluster.encryption_type}')
               if cluster.encryption_type == 'GOOGLE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION':
                   print('  Warning: Cluster is not encrypted with a customer-managed key!')

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       list_clusters()
   ```
   This script will print out the name of each Bigtable instance and cluster, along with its encryption type. If a cluster is not encrypted with a customer-managed key, it will print a warning message.

4. **Run the Python script:**
   You can run the script using the following command:
   ```
   python list_clusters.py
   ```
   This will print out the encryption settings for all your Bigtable clusters. If any clusters are not encrypted with a customer-managed key, you will see a warning message.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Bigtable Cluster Should Be Encrypted With Customer Managed Keys" for GCP using GCP Console, please follow the below steps:

1. Log in to your GCP Console.
2. Go to the Bigtable instances page by clicking on "Navigation Menu > Bigtable" or by searching for "Bigtable" in the search bar.
3. Select the Bigtable instance that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Encryption" tab.
5. Under the "Encryption at rest" section, select "Customer-managed key".
6. Click on "Create a key".
7. Choose the location for the key.
8. Choose the key ring for the key.
9. Enter a name for the key.
10. Click on "Create".
11. Select the newly created key from the dropdown menu.
12. Click on "Save" to save the changes.

After following these steps, your Bigtable cluster will be encrypted with customer-managed keys and the misconfiguration will be remediated.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration in GCP, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project where the Bigtable cluster is located.

2. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon in the top right corner of the console.

3. In the Cloud Shell, run the following command to enable the Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API:

   ```
   gcloud services enable cloudkms.googleapis.com
   ```

4. Create a new keyring in the Cloud KMS:

   ```
   gcloud kms keyrings create <keyring-name> --location <location>
   ```

   Replace `<keyring-name>` with a name for the keyring and `<location>` with the location where the keyring will be stored (for example, us-central1).

5. Create a new key in the keyring:

   ```
   gcloud kms keys create <key-name> --keyring <keyring-name> --location <location> --purpose encryption
   ```

   Replace `<key-name>` with a name for the key.

6. Get the resource ID of the key:

   ```
   gcloud kms keys describe <key-name> --keyring <keyring-name> --location <location> --format="value(name)"
   ```

7. Update the Bigtable cluster to use the customer-managed encryption key:

   ```
   gcloud beta bigtable clusters update <cluster-id> --location <location> --encryption-type=customer-managed --kms-key-name=<key-resource-id>
   ```

   Replace `<cluster-id>` with the ID of the Bigtable cluster and `<key-resource-id>` with the resource ID of the key obtained in step 6.

8. Verify that the Bigtable cluster is now using the customer-managed encryption key:

   ```
   gcloud beta bigtable clusters describe <cluster-id> --location <location> --format="value(encryptionConfig.kmsKeyName)"
   ```

   This command should return the resource ID of the key.

That's it! Your Bigtable cluster is now encrypted with a customer-managed key.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Bigtable Cluster Should Be Encrypted With Customer Managed Keys" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

project_id = 'your-project-id'
instance_id = 'your-instance-id'

# Set the Cloud KMS key name
kms_key_name = 'projects/{}/locations/{}/keyRings/{}/cryptoKeys/{}'.format(
    project_id, 'global', 'your-key-ring', 'your-key')

# Create a new instance of the Bigtable client library
client = bigtable_admin_v2.BigtableInstanceAdminClient()

# Retrieve the Bigtable cluster instance by its ID
cluster_name = client.cluster_path(project_id, instance_id, 'your-cluster-id')
cluster = client.get_cluster(cluster_name)

# Create a new instance of the EncryptionInfo class
encryption_info = EncryptionInfo()

# Set the encryption type to CUSTOMER_MANAGED_ENCRYPTION
encryption_info.encryption_type = EncryptionType.CUSTOMER_MANAGED_ENCRYPTION

# Set the Cloud KMS key name
encryption_info.kms_key_name = kms_key_name

# Update the Bigtable cluster instance with the new encryption configuration
update_mask = {'paths': ['encryption_config']}
update_cluster_request = {
    'cluster': cluster,
    'update_mask': update_mask,
    'encryption_config': encryption_info
}
client.update_cluster(update_cluster_request)
```

Note: Make sure to replace the placeholders `your-project-id`, `your-instance-id`, `your-cluster-id`, `your-key-ring`, and `your-key` with the actual values specific to your GCP project and Bigtable instance.
