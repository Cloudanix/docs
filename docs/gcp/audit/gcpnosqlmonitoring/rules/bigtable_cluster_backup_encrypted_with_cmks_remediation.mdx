### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Bigtable Instances: From the GCP Console dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner), scroll down and click on "Bigtable" under the "STORAGE" section. This will take you to the Bigtable instances page.

3. Check Encryption Settings: Click on the name of the Bigtable instance you want to check. This will open the instance details page. Scroll down to the "Encryption" section. Here, you can see the type of key used for encryption. If it says "Google-managed key", then the Bigtable cluster backup is not encrypted with a customer-managed key.

4. Use Cloud Key Management Service: To confirm, you can also check the Cloud Key Management Service (KMS). Go back to the navigation menu, scroll down and click on "Security" then "Key Management". Here, you can see all the keys that you have created. If there is no key associated with your Bigtable instance, then it is not encrypted with a customer-managed key.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install and authenticate it.

2. Once the SDK is installed and configured, you can list all the Bigtable instances in your project using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud bigtable instances list --project=[PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual project ID. This command will return a list of all Bigtable instances in your project.

3. For each instance, you can list all the clusters using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud bigtable clusters list --instance=[INSTANCE_ID] --project=[PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_ID]` and `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual instance ID and project ID respectively. This command will return a list of all clusters in the specified instance.

4. For each cluster, you can check the encryption settings using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud bigtable clusters describe [CLUSTER_ID] --instance=[INSTANCE_ID] --project=[PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[CLUSTER_ID]`, `[INSTANCE_ID]` and `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual cluster ID, instance ID and project ID respectively. This command will return the details of the specified cluster, including the encryption settings. If the encryption type is not "GOOGLE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION", it means the cluster is encrypted with a customer-managed key.

#### Using Python

To check if Bigtable Cluster Backups are encrypted with Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you can use the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) or the Google Cloud Client Libraries for Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Setup Google Cloud SDK and Python Environment:**
   First, you need to install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK. Also, set up a Python virtual environment and install the Google Cloud Bigtable and Google Cloud KMS libraries.

   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install google-cloud-bigtable google-cloud-kms
   ```

2. **Authenticate and Set Project:**
   Authenticate your SDK to access the GCP resources and set your working project.

   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
   ```

3. **Python Script to Check Encryption:**
   Write a Python script to list all Bigtable backups and check if they are encrypted with CMKs. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import bigtable
   from google.cloud import kms

   def check_bigtable_backup_encryption():
       client = bigtable.Client()
       kms_client = kms.KeyManagementServiceClient()

       for instance in client.list_instances():
           for cluster in instance.list_clusters():
               for backup in cluster.list_backups():
                   # Get the encryption info of the backup
                   encryption_info = backup.encryption_info
                   # Check if the encryption type is Customer Managed Encryption
                   if encryption_info.encryption_type == encryption_info.EncryptionType.CUSTOMER_MANAGED_ENCRYPTION:
                       # Get the KMS key used for encryption
                       kms_key = kms_client.crypto_key_path(encryption_info.kms_key_name)
                       print(f'Backup {backup.name} is encrypted with CMK {kms_key}')
                   else:
                       print(f'Backup {backup.name} is not encrypted with CMK')

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_bigtable_backup_encryption()
   ```

4. **Run the Python Script:**
   Finally, run the Python script. It will list all the Bigtable backups and indicate whether they are encrypted with CMKs or not.

   ```bash
   python check_bigtable_backup_encryption.py
   ```

Please note that this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to list Bigtable instances, clusters, backups, and KMS keys. If you encounter any permission errors, you may need to grant the necessary IAM roles to your account.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Bigtable Cluster Backups Should Be Encrypted With Customer Managed Keys" for GCP using GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project where your Bigtable cluster is located.

2. Go to the Cloud Bigtable section of the console and select your Bigtable instance.

3. Click on the "Backups" tab and select the backup that you want to encrypt with a customer-managed key.

4. Click on the "Edit" button next to the backup.

5. In the "Encryption" section, select "Customer-managed key" from the drop-down menu.

6. Click on the "Select a key" button and choose the customer-managed key that you want to use to encrypt the backup.

7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

8. Repeat steps 3-7 for all the backups associated with your Bigtable cluster.

By following these steps, you will remediate the misconfiguration by encrypting your Bigtable cluster backups with customer-managed keys.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Bigtable Cluster Backups not being encrypted with customer-managed keys, you can follow the below steps using GCP CLI:

1. Create a new key ring:

```
gcloud kms keyrings create [KEYRING_NAME] --location=[LOCATION]
```

Replace `[KEYRING_NAME]` with the name of the key ring you want to create and `[LOCATION]` with the location where you want to create the key ring.

2. Create a new key:

```
gcloud kms keys create [KEY_NAME] --keyring=[KEYRING_NAME] --location=[LOCATION] --purpose=encryption
```

Replace `[KEY_NAME]` with the name of the key you want to create and `[KEYRING_NAME]` and `[LOCATION]` with the name of the key ring and location where you created the key ring in step 1.

3. Grant the Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) service account permission to access the key:

```
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding [KEY_NAME] --keyring=[KEYRING_NAME] --location=[LOCATION] --member=serviceAccount:cloudkms@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com --role=roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter
```

Replace `[KEY_NAME]`, `[KEYRING_NAME]`, `[LOCATION]`, and `[PROJECT_ID]` with the name of the key, key ring, location, and project ID where you created the key ring.

4. Enable encryption for Bigtable backups:

```
gcloud beta bigtable clusters update [CLUSTER_ID] --backup-encryption-key=[KEY_NAME] --backup-encryption-key-version=1
```

Replace `[CLUSTER_ID]` with the ID of the Bigtable cluster you want to update, `[KEY_NAME]` with the name of the key you created in step 2, and `1` with the version number of the key.

After following these steps, all new backups for the Bigtable cluster will be encrypted with the customer-managed key.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Bigtable Cluster Backups Should Be Encrypted With Customer Managed Keys in GCP, you can follow the below steps using Python:

1. First, create a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) in the Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) using the following code:

```python
from google.cloud import kms_v1
from google.cloud.kms_v1 import enums

def create_key(project_id, location_id, key_ring_id, key_id):
    client = kms_v1.KeyManagementServiceClient()
    parent = client.key_ring_path(project_id, location_id, key_ring_id)

    purpose = enums.CryptoKey.CryptoKeyPurpose.ENCRYPT_DECRYPT
    algorithm = enums.CryptoKeyVersion.CryptoKeyVersionAlgorithm.GOOGLE_SYMMETRIC_ENCRYPTION

    crypto_key = {
        'purpose': purpose,
        'version_template': {
            'algorithm': algorithm
        }
    }

    response = client.create_crypto_key(parent, key_id, crypto_key)

    print('Created key: {}'.format(response.name))
```

2. Next, enable encryption for your Bigtable cluster backups using the CMEK you just created:

```python
from google.cloud import bigtable_admin_v2
from google.cloud.bigtable_admin_v2 import enums

def enable_backup_encryption(project_id, instance_id, cluster_id, key_name):
    client = bigtable_admin_v2.BigtableTableAdminClient()
    cluster_name = client.cluster_path(project_id, instance_id, cluster_id)
    encryption_config = {
        'encryption_type': enums.EncryptionInfo.EncryptionType.GOOGLE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION,
        'encryption_info': {
            'kms_key_name': key_name
        }
    }
    cluster = client.get_cluster(cluster_name)
    cluster.encryption_config = encryption_config
    update_mask = {
        'paths': [
            'encryption_config'
        ]
    }
    client.update_cluster(cluster, update_mask)
```

3. Finally, verify that encryption is enabled for your Bigtable cluster backups:

```python
from google.cloud.bigtable import Client

def verify_encryption_enabled(project_id, instance_id, cluster_id):
    client = Client(project=project_id, admin=True)
    cluster = client.instance(instance_id).cluster(cluster_id)
    if cluster.encryption_config.encryption_type == enums.EncryptionInfo.EncryptionType.GOOGLE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION:
        print('Encryption is enabled for cluster backups.')
    else:
        print('Encryption is not enabled for cluster backups.')
```

Note: Make sure to replace `project_id`, `location_id`, `key_ring_id`, `key_id`, `instance_id`, `cluster_id`, and `key_name` with your own values.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Bigtable Cluster Backups Should Be Encrypted With Customer Managed Keys in GCP using Python.
