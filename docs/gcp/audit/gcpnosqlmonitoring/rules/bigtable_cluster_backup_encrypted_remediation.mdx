### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform web console and sign in with your Google account that has the necessary permissions to access Bigtable resources.

2. Navigate to Bigtable Instances: From the GCP Console dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner). Scroll down and click on "Bigtable" under the "STORAGE" section. This will take you to the Bigtable instances page.

3. Check Bigtable Cluster Encryption: Click on the name of the Bigtable instance you want to check. This will take you to the instance details page. Under the "Cluster" section, you will see the details of the cluster including the encryption status. If the "Cloud Key Management Service key" field is empty, it means that the Bigtable cluster backups are not encrypted.

4. Verify with Cloud Key Management Service: To further verify, you can navigate to the Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) from the navigation menu. Here, you can check if there are any encryption keys associated with your Bigtable instance. If there are no keys, it confirms that the Bigtable cluster backups are not encrypted.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website. After installation, authenticate your account using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. List all Bigtable instances: Use the following command to list all the Bigtable instances in your project:

   ```
   gcloud bigtable instances list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all Bigtable instances along with their details.

3. List all clusters for each instance: For each instance, list all the clusters using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud bigtable clusters list --instance=[INSTANCE_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_ID]` with the ID of your Bigtable instance. This command will return a list of all clusters for the specified instance.

4. Check the encryption status of each cluster: Unfortunately, GCP CLI does not provide a direct command to check the encryption status of Bigtable clusters. You would need to use the Google Cloud Console or the Google Cloud Client Libraries to check this information. 

   However, by default, all data stored in Bigtable, including backups, is encrypted at rest using Google's default encryption. You can verify this by checking the "Encryption" section in the details of each Bigtable cluster in the Google Cloud Console.

#### Using Python

To check if Bigtable Cluster Backups are encrypted in No SQL using python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud Bigtable:**
   Before you start, make sure you have Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud Bigtable installed on your system. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigtable
   ```

2. **Set up Authentication:**
   You need to authenticate your SDK with Google Cloud. You can do this by setting the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the path of your service account key JSON file.
   ```
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
   ```

3. **List all Bigtable Backups:**
   Use the Bigtable client to list all backups. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   from google.cloud import bigtable

   client = bigtable.Client(project='my-project', admin=True)
   instance = client.instance('my-instance')

   for cluster in instance.list_clusters()[0]:
       for backup in cluster.list_backups():
           print(backup)
   ```
   This script will print all backups in all clusters of the specified instance.

4. **Check Encryption Status:**
   For each backup, check the encryption status. If the encryption info is None or the encryption type is not `GOOGLE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION`, then the backup is not encrypted with Google's default encryption.
   ```python
   for cluster in instance.list_clusters()[0]:
       for backup in cluster.list_backups():
           if backup.encryption_info is None or backup.encryption_info.encryption_type != 'GOOGLE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION':
               print(f'Backup {backup.name} is not encrypted with Google default encryption.')
   ```
   This script will print the names of all backups that are not encrypted with Google's default encryption.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of unencrypted Bigtable Cluster backups in GCP, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Bigtable Cluster backups page.

2. Select the Bigtable cluster for which you want to enable backup encryption.

3. Click on the "Edit" button located at the top of the page.

4. Scroll down to the "Backup Encryption" section and select "Enabled".

5. Choose the key version you want to use for encryption and click on "Save".

6. Once the backup encryption is enabled, all new backups for the selected Bigtable cluster will be encrypted using the specified key version.

7. You can also verify the encryption status of existing backups by checking the "Encryption" column in the backups table.

It is important to note that enabling backup encryption may increase the cost of backups due to the additional resources required for encryption. However, it is a necessary step to ensure the security of your data.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of unencrypted backups for a Bigtable cluster in GCP, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to list all the Bigtable instances in the current project:

   ```
   gcloud bigtable instances list
   ```

3. Identify the instance for which you want to enable encrypted backups.

4. Run the following command to enable encryption for backups for the identified instance:

   ```
   gcloud beta bigtable instances update [INSTANCE_ID] --backup-encryption google-default-kms-key
   ```

   Replace [INSTANCE_ID] with the actual ID of the Bigtable instance.

5. The above command enables encryption for backups using the default Google Cloud KMS key. If you want to use a different KMS key, replace `google-default-kms-key` with the resource ID of the desired KMS key.

6. Once the command executes successfully, encrypted backups will be enabled for the specified Bigtable instance.

Note: The above command enables encryption for future backups only. To encrypt existing backups, you need to create a new backup and delete the old unencrypted backup.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Bigtable Cluster Backups Should Be Encrypted misconfiguration in GCP using python, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.

2. Install the `google-cloud-bigtable` library using the following command:

```
pip install google-cloud-bigtable
```

3. Create a Python script to enable encryption for Bigtable cluster backups. Here is an example script:

```python
from google.cloud import bigtable
from google.cloud.bigtable import enums
from google.cloud.bigtable.admin_v2 import enums as admin_enums
from google.cloud.bigtable.admin_v2 import BigtableTableAdminClient
from google.cloud.bigtable.admin_v2.types import CreateBackupRequest, Backup, EncryptionInfo

# Set the project ID, instance ID, and cluster ID for your Bigtable cluster
project_id = 'your-project-id'
instance_id = 'your-instance-id'
cluster_id = 'your-cluster-id'

# Set the ID and encryption type for your backup
backup_id = 'your-backup-id'
encryption_type = enums.EncryptionInfo.EncryptionType.GOOGLE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION

# Create a client to interact with the Bigtable table admin API
client = BigtableTableAdminClient()

# Get the cluster object for your Bigtable cluster
cluster = client.get_cluster(request={"name": f"projects/{project_id}/instances/{instance_id}/clusters/{cluster_id}"})

# Create the encryption info object for your backup
encryption_info = EncryptionInfo(encryption_type=encryption_type)

# Create the backup object with encryption info
backup = Backup(
    encryption_info=encryption_info
)

# Create the backup request with backup ID and cluster name
backup_request = CreateBackupRequest(
    parent=cluster.name,
    backup_id=backup_id,
    backup=backup
)

# Create the backup
client.create_backup(request=backup_request)

# Print confirmation message
print(f"Backup {backup_id} created with encryption enabled.")
```

4. Replace the placeholders in the script with your own project ID, instance ID, cluster ID, backup ID, and encryption type.

5. Run the script in the Cloud Shell using the following command:

```
python script_name.py
```

6. Verify that the backup was created with encryption enabled by checking the backup details in the GCP console.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the Bigtable Cluster Backups Should Be Encrypted misconfiguration in GCP using python.
