3. Select the Bigtable instance that contains the cluster backup that needs encryption.
    (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Bigtable Cluster Backups Should Be Encrypted With Customer Managed Keys" Policy.)
4. In the instance details page, click on the "Backups" tab.
5. Locate the backup that is not encrypted and click on its name to access the backup details.
6. In the backup details page, click on the "Edit" button.
7. Scroll down to the "Encryption" section and enable encryption for the backup.
