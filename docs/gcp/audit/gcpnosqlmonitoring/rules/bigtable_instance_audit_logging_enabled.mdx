### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Bigtable Instances: From the main navigation menu, select "Bigtable" under the "STORAGE" section. This will take you to the "Bigtable instances" page where all your Bigtable instances are listed.

3. Select the Bigtable Instance: Click on the name of the Bigtable instance that you want to check for audit logging. This will take you to the instance details page.

4. Check Audit Logging: On the instance details page, navigate to the "Cloud Audit Logs" section. If audit logging is enabled, you will see a list of logs. If it's not enabled, the section will be empty or you will see a message indicating that audit logging is not enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website. After installation, authenticate your account using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. List all Bigtable instances: Use the following command to list all the Bigtable instances in your GCP project:

   ```
   gcloud bigtable instances list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all Bigtable instances along with their details.

3. Get the IAM policy for each Bigtable instance: For each instance, you need to check the IAM policy to see if audit logging is enabled. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud bigtable instances get-iam-policy [INSTANCE_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_ID]` with the ID of the Bigtable instance you want to check. This command will return the IAM policy for the specified instance.

4. Check for audit logging: In the output of the previous command, look for the `auditConfigs` section. If audit logging is enabled, you should see an entry like this:

   ```
   auditConfigs:
   - service: bigtable.googleapis.com
     auditLogConfigs:
     - logType: ADMIN_READ
     - logType: DATA_WRITE
     - logType: DATA_READ
   ```

   If you don't see this entry, it means that audit logging is not enabled for the Bigtable instance.

#### Using Python

To check if Bigtable instances have audit logging enabled in No SQL using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set up Google Cloud SDK and Authentication:**
   Before you start, make sure you have the Google Cloud SDK installed and initialized and you're authenticated with the correct account. You can use the following command to authenticate:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
2. **Install Required Python Libraries:**
   You will need the `google-cloud-bigtable` and `google-cloud-logging` libraries. Install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigtable google-cloud-logging
   ```
3. **Fetch Bigtable Instances:**
   Use the `google.cloud.bigtable.Client` class to create a client object, which can be used to fetch all Bigtable instances. Here's a sample script:
   ```python
   from google.cloud import bigtable
   client = bigtable.Client()
   instances = client.list_instances()[0]
   ```
4. **Check Audit Logging:**
   For each instance, use the `google.cloud.logging.Client` class to fetch the audit logs. If no logs are found, it means audit logging is not enabled. Here's a sample script:
   ```python
   from google.cloud import logging
   logging_client = logging.Client()

   for instance in instances:
       filter_str = f"logName:logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com AND resource.type=bigtable_instance AND resource.labels.instance_id={instance.instance_id}"
       logs = logging_client.list_entries(filter_=filter_str)  # API call
       logs = list(logs)
       if not logs:
           print(f"Audit logging is not enabled for instance {instance.instance_id}")
   ```
This script will print the IDs of all Bigtable instances that do not have audit logging enabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Bigtable Instances Should Have Audit Logging Enabled" misconfiguration in GCP using the GCP console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project in which the Bigtable instance is created.
2. In the left navigation menu, select "Bigtable" under the "Storage" section.
3. Select the Bigtable instance for which you want to enable audit logging.
4. In the Bigtable instance details page, click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
5. Scroll down to the "Cloud Audit Logs" section and click on the "Add logging" button.
6. In the "Add logging" dialog box, select the logs that you want to enable for the Bigtable instance. You can select from the following logs:
   - Admin Activity
   - Data Access
   - System Event
7. Once you have selected the logs, click on the "Save" button to enable audit logging for the Bigtable instance.

By following the above steps, you can enable audit logging for the Bigtable instance in GCP using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Bigtable Instances not having audit logging enabled in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking on the Activate Cloud Shell button in the top right-hand corner of the Google Cloud Console.

2. Run the following command to enable audit logging for Bigtable instances:

   ```
   gcloud alpha bigtable instances update INSTANCE_ID --enable-logging --log-filter=bigtable.googleapis.com/instance
   ```

   Replace `INSTANCE_ID` with the ID of the Bigtable instance for which you want to enable audit logging.

3. After running the above command, you will receive a confirmation message that the instance has been updated with audit logging enabled.

   ```
   Updated [https://bigtable.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/instances/INSTANCE_ID].
   ```

4. Verify that the audit logging is enabled for the Bigtable instance by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud alpha bigtable instances describe INSTANCE_ID --format="value(logging.enable)"
   ```

   This command will return `True` if audit logging is enabled for the instance.

5. Repeat the above steps for all the Bigtable instances in your GCP project to ensure that audit logging is enabled for all of them.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Bigtable Instances not having audit logging enabled in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Bigtable Instances not having Audit Logging enabled in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries and authenticate the GCP credentials using the `google-cloud-bigtable` library and `Application Default Credentials (ADC)`:

```
from google.cloud import bigtable
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/credentials.json')
client = bigtable.Client(project='your_project_id', credentials=credentials)
```

2. Retrieve the list of Bigtable instances in the project using the `list_instances()` method:

```
instances = client.list_instances()
```

3. Loop through each instance and check if Audit Logging is enabled or not using the `get_iam_policy()` method:

```
for instance in instances:
    policy = instance.get_iam_policy(requested_policy_version=3)
    bindings = policy.bindings

    for binding in bindings:
        if binding.role == 'roles/bigtable.admin':
            if 'logging.logEntries.create' not in binding.members:
                binding.members.append('group:cloud-logs@google.com')
```

4. If Audit Logging is not enabled, add the `group:cloud-logs@google.com` member to the `roles/bigtable.admin` role using the `binding.members.append()` method:

```
if 'logging.logEntries.create' not in binding.members:
    binding.members.append('group:cloud-logs@google.com')
```

5. Update the IAM policy for the instance using the `set_iam_policy()` method:

```
instance.set_iam_policy(policy)
```

6. The final code would look like this:

```
from google.cloud import bigtable
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/credentials.json')
client = bigtable.Client(project='your_project_id', credentials=credentials)

instances = client.list_instances()

for instance in instances:
    policy = instance.get_iam_policy(requested_policy_version=3)
    bindings = policy.bindings

    for binding in bindings:
        if binding.role == 'roles/bigtable.admin':
            if 'logging.logEntries.create' not in binding.members:
                binding.members.append('group:cloud-logs@google.com')
    
    instance.set_iam_policy(policy)
```

7. Run the code and verify that Audit Logging is enabled for all Bigtable instances in the project.
