### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloudtasks Queue Max Retry Duration Should Be Set" in GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the GCP console (console.cloud.google.com).
2. Navigate to the Cloud Tasks page by clicking on the left-hand side menu and selecting "Cloud Tasks" under the "Tools" section.
3. Select the queue that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
5. Scroll down to the "Retry configuration" section.
6. Set the "Max retry duration" to the desired value. This value represents the maximum amount of time that a task can be retried before it is marked as failed.
7. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page to save your changes.

After following these steps, the misconfiguration "Cloudtasks Queue Max Retry Duration Should Be Set" will be remediated for the selected queue in GCP.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Cloudtasks Queue Max Retry Duration Should Be Set" misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud SDK Shell or any terminal of your choice.

2. Run the following command to set the max retry duration for the Cloud Tasks queue:

   ```
   gcloud tasks queues update QUEUE_NAME --max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS --max-attempt-duration=MAX_ATTEMPT_DURATION
   ```

   Replace the `QUEUE_NAME` with the name of the queue you want to update, `MAX_ATTEMPTS` with the maximum number of attempts to execute the task and `MAX_ATTEMPT_DURATION` with the maximum duration for each attempt.

   For example, to set the max retry duration to 10 minutes and the max number of attempts to 3 for a queue named `my-queue`, run the following command:

   ```
   gcloud tasks queues update my-queue --max-attempts=3 --max-attempt-duration=600s
   ```

3. Verify the changes by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud tasks queues describe QUEUE_NAME
   ```

   Replace the `QUEUE_NAME` with the name of the queue you updated. This command will display the updated configuration of the queue.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the "Cloudtasks Queue Max Retry Duration Should Be Set" misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloudtasks Queue Max Retry Duration Should Be Set" in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from google.cloud import tasks_v2
from google.protobuf import duration_pb2
```

2. Initialize the Cloud Tasks client:

```python
client = tasks_v2.CloudTasksClient()
```

3. Get the queue name for which you want to set the max retry duration:

```python
queue_name = client.queue_path(project, location, queue)
```

4. Set the max retry duration for the queue:

```python
queue = client.get_queue(request={"name": queue_name})

queue.retry_config.max_retry_duration = duration_pb2.Duration(
    seconds=max_retry_duration_seconds
)

update_mask = {"paths": {"retry_config.max_retry_duration"}}

response = client.update_queue(queue=queue, update_mask=update_mask)
```

In the above code, replace `project`, `location`, and `queue` with your GCP project name, the location of the queue, and the name of the queue, respectively. Also, replace `max_retry_duration_seconds` with the desired max retry duration in seconds.

5. Verify that the max retry duration has been set:

```python
queue = client.get_queue(request={"name": queue_name})
print(f"Max retry duration: {queue.retry_config.max_retry_duration.seconds}s")
```

This will print the max retry duration set for the queue.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cloudtasks Queue Max Retry Duration Should Be Set" for GCP using Python.
