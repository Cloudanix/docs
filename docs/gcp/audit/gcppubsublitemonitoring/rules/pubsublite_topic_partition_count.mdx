#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Pub/Sub Lite: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines) located at the top left corner of the page. Scroll down and click on "Pub/Sub" under the "Big Data" section. Then, select "Lite" to access the Pub/Sub Lite service.

3. Check Topic Partitions: In the Pub/Sub Lite dashboard, you will see a list of all your Pub/Sub Lite topics. Click on the name of the topic you want to check. This will open the topic details page. Here, you can see the number of partitions for the topic under the "Partition count" section.

4. Verify Partition Count: If the partition count is less than 1, it indicates a misconfiguration. The partition count for a Pub/Sub Lite topic should always be at least 1 for proper functioning and to ensure message delivery.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI if you haven't done so already. You can do this by following the instructions provided by Google Cloud at https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install.

2. Once the Google Cloud SDK CLI is installed and configured, you can list all the PubSub Lite topics in your project by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   gcloud pubsub lite-topics list --location=<location>
   ```
   Replace `<location>` with the location of your PubSub Lite topics.

3. To get the details of a specific topic, including the partition count, run the following command:

   ```
   gcloud pubsub lite-topics describe <topic-name> --location=<location>
   ```
   Replace `<topic-name>` with the name of the topic you want to check and `<location>` with the location of the topic.

4. The output of the above command will include a line that looks like this:

   ```
   partitionCount: <number>
   ```
   If the `<number>` is less than 1, then the PubSub Lite Topic Partition Count is not at least 1.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Google Cloud PubSub Lite library is required to interact with PubSub Lite resources. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install google-cloud-pubsublite
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules and set up the client: You need to import the PubSub Lite and Google Auth libraries. Then, create a client for PubSub Lite.
   ```python
   from google.cloud.pubsublite import AdminClient
   from google.cloud.pubsublite.types import CloudRegion, CloudZone, TopicPath
   from google.auth import exceptions

   region = "your-region"
   zone = "your-zone"
   project_number = "your-project-number"
   topic_id = "your-topic-id"

   cloud_region = CloudRegion(region)
   location = CloudZone(cloud_region, zone)
   topic_path = TopicPath(project_number, location, topic_id)

   client = AdminClient(cloud_region)
   ```

3. Fetch the topic details: Use the `get_topic` method of the client to fetch the details of the topic.
   ```python
   try:
       topic = client.get_topic(topic_path)
   except exceptions.GoogleAuthError as e:
       print(f"Unable to authenticate to Google Cloud: {e}")
   ```

4. Check the partition count: The `partition_count` attribute of the topic object gives the number of partitions in the topic. If it is less than 1, then it is a misconfiguration.
   ```python
   if topic.partition_count < 1:
       print(f"Misconfiguration detected: The partition count of the topic {topic_id} is less than 1.")
   else:
       print(f"The partition count of the topic {topic_id} is {topic.partition_count}.")
   ```
This script will help you detect if the partition count of a PubSub Lite topic is less than 1. Replace "your-region", "your-zone", "your-project-number", and "your-topic-id" with your actual Google Cloud project details.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the PubSub Lite Topic partition count misconfiguration for GCP using the GCP console:

1. Open the GCP Console and navigate to the Pub/Sub Lite Topics page.
2. Select the Pub/Sub Lite Topic for which you want to remediate the partition count misconfiguration.
3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
4. In the "Edit topic" dialog box, scroll down to the "Partition count" section.
5. Set the partition count to at least 1.
6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

That's it! The Pub/Sub Lite Topic partition count misconfiguration has now been remediated for GCP using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "PubSub Lite Topic Partition Count Should Be At Least 1" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell on GCP console.

2. Run the following command to list all the Pub/Sub Lite topics in your project:

```
gcloud pubsub lite-topics list --location=LOCATION --project=PROJECT_ID
```

Replace `LOCATION` with the location of your Pub/Sub Lite topic and `PROJECT_ID` with your GCP project ID.

3. Choose the Pub/Sub Lite topic that you want to remediate and run the following command to update the partition count to at least 1:

```
gcloud pubsub lite-topics update TOPIC_ID --location=LOCATION --partition-count=1 --project=PROJECT_ID
```

Replace `TOPIC_ID` with the ID of the Pub/Sub Lite topic that you want to remediate, `LOCATION` with the location of your Pub/Sub Lite topic, and `PROJECT_ID` with your GCP project ID.

4. Verify that the partition count has been updated by running the following command:

```
gcloud pubsub lite-topics describe TOPIC_ID --location=LOCATION --project=PROJECT_ID
```

Replace `TOPIC_ID` with the ID of the Pub/Sub Lite topic that you want to remediate, `LOCATION` with the location of your Pub/Sub Lite topic, and `PROJECT_ID` with your GCP project ID.

This should remediate the misconfiguration "PubSub Lite Topic Partition Count Should Be At Least 1" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the PubSub Lite Topic Partition Count should be at least 1 for GCP, you can use the following Python code:

1. First, you need to import the necessary libraries:

```python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
from google.api_core import exceptions
```

2. Then, you need to create a `PublisherClient` object:

```python
publisher_client = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
```

3. Next, you need to get the topic path:

```python
project_id = "your-project-id"
topic_name = "your-topic-name"
topic_path = publisher_client.topic_path(project_id, topic_name)
```

4. After that, you need to get the current topic configuration:

```python
try:
    topic = publisher_client.get_topic(request={"topic": topic_path})
except exceptions.NotFound:
    print(f"Topic {topic_path} not found.")
    return
```

5. Then, you need to check if the partition count is less than 1:

```python
if topic.partition_config.count < 1:
    topic.partition_config.count = 1
```

6. Finally, you need to update the topic with the new configuration:

```python
update_mask = {"paths": ["partition_config.count"]}
try:
    publisher_client.update_topic(topic=topic, update_mask=update_mask)
    print(f"Topic {topic_path} partition count updated to {topic.partition_config.count}.")
except exceptions.GoogleAPICallError:
    print(f"Failed to update topic {topic_path}.")
```

The complete Python code to remediate the PubSub Lite Topic Partition Count should be at least 1 for GCP would look like this:

```python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
from google.api_core import exceptions

publisher_client = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()

project_id = "your-project-id"
topic_name = "your-topic-name"
topic_path = publisher_client.topic_path(project_id, topic_name)

try:
    topic = publisher_client.get_topic(request={"topic": topic_path})
except exceptions.NotFound:
    print(f"Topic {topic_path} not found.")
    exit()

if topic.partition_config.count < 1:
    topic.partition_config.count = 1

update_mask = {"paths": ["partition_config.count"]}
try:
    publisher_client.update_topic(topic=topic, update_mask=update_mask)
    print(f"Topic {topic_path} partition count updated to {topic.partition_config.count}.")
except exceptions.GoogleAPICallError:
    print(f"Failed to update topic {topic_path}.")
```
