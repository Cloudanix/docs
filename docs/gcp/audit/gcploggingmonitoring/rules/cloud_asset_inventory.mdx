### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Select your Google Cloud Platform project: From the console dashboard, select the project that you want to examine from the project drop-down list.

3. Navigate to Cloud Asset Inventory page: From the navigation menu, select "Cloud Asset Inventory". This will take you to the Cloud Asset Inventory page where you can view all the assets associated with your selected project.

4. Check if Cloud Asset Inventory is enabled: On the Cloud Asset Inventory page, check if the Cloud Asset Inventory is enabled for logging. If it is not enabled, it indicates a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access and manage Google Cloud services.

2. Use the following command to list all the projects in your Google Cloud account:

   ```
   gcloud projects list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all your projects, including their PROJECT_ID, NAME, and PROJECT_NUMBER.

3. To check if Cloud Asset Inventory is enabled for a specific project, use the following command:

   ```
   gcloud services list --enabled --project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace [PROJECT_ID] with the ID of the project you want to check. This command will return a list of all the enabled services for the specified project.

4. Look for "cloudasset.googleapis.com" in the list of enabled services. If it's present, then Cloud Asset Inventory is enabled for the project. If it's not present, then Cloud Asset Inventory is not enabled.

#### Using Python

To check if Cloud Asset Inventory is enabled in logging using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Cloud Asset:**
   Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Cloud Asset. You can install the Python client using pip:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-asset
   ```

2. **Set up Authentication:**
   You need to authenticate your SDK with Google Cloud. You can do this by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable, which should point to the service account key JSON file.
   ```
   import os
   os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"]="/path/to/keyfile.json"
   ```

3. **Create a Client:**
   Create a client for the `CloudAssetService`:
   ```
   from google.cloud import asset_v1

   client = asset_v1.CloudAssetServiceClient()
   ```

4. **Check for Cloud Asset Inventory:**
   Now, you can use the `list_feeds` method to check if Cloud Asset Inventory is enabled. If the response is empty, it means that Cloud Asset Inventory is not enabled.
   ```
   parent = client.common_project_path('[PROJECT_ID]')
   response = client.list_feeds(parent=parent)

   if not response:
       print("Cloud Asset Inventory is not enabled.")
   else:
       print("Cloud Asset Inventory is enabled.")
   ```
   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your project ID.

Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual project details. Also, ensure that the service account you're using has the necessary permissions to access the Cloud Asset Inventory.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Cloud Asset Inventory Is Enabled" for GCP using GCP console, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP console and go to the Navigation menu.

2. Select the "Security Command Center" option under the "Security" section.

3. Click on the "Organization" tab and select your organization from the dropdown list.

4. Click on the "Asset Inventory" tab and select the project for which you want to enable the Cloud Asset Inventory.

5. Click on the "Enable" button to enable the Cloud Asset Inventory for the selected project.

6. Review the configuration settings and click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

7. Once the Cloud Asset Inventory is enabled, you can view the assets and their metadata in the Security Command Center dashboard.

8. To ensure that the Cloud Asset Inventory is continuously enabled, you can set up a periodic review of the configuration settings.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Cloud Asset Inventory Is Enabled" for GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Cloud Asset Inventory is enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the GCP Cloud Shell or any other terminal where GCP CLI is installed.

Step 2: Run the following command to enable the Cloud Asset Inventory API:

```
gcloud services enable cloudasset.googleapis.com
```

Step 3: Next, run the following command to create a new asset inventory:

```
gcloud asset create-feed <FEED_NAME> --content-type=resource --asset-names=<ASSET_NAME> --project=<PROJECT_ID>
```

Note: Replace `<FEED_NAME>` with the desired name for the new feed, `<ASSET_NAME>` with the name of the asset you want to inventory, and `<PROJECT_ID>` with the ID of the project where the asset is located.

Step 4: Run the following command to list all the feeds that have been created:

```
gcloud asset feeds list --project=<PROJECT_ID>
```

Step 5: Finally, run the following command to view the details of the new feed:

```
gcloud asset feeds describe <FEED_NAME> --project=<PROJECT_ID>
```

Note: Replace `<FEED_NAME>` with the name of the feed you created in Step 3, and `<PROJECT_ID>` with the ID of the project where the asset is located.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the Cloud Asset Inventory is enabled for your GCP project.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Ensure Cloud Asset Inventory Is Enabled" misconfiguration for GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries: 

```python
!pip install google-cloud-asset google-auth
```

2. Set up authentication: 

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/your/credentials.json')
```

3. Import the necessary libraries: 

```python
from google.cloud import asset_v1
from google.cloud.asset_v1 import enums
```

4. Create a client instance: 

```python
client = asset_v1.AssetServiceClient(credentials=credentials)
```

5. Check if Cloud Asset Inventory is enabled: 

```python
response = client.search_all_resources(
    scope='organizations/your_organization_id',
    asset_types=['cloudasset.googleapis.com/Asset'],
    query='resourceProperties.enableAssetDiscovery:true'
)

if len(response) > 0:
    print("Cloud Asset Inventory is already enabled.")
else:
    print("Cloud Asset Inventory is not enabled.")
```

6. If Cloud Asset Inventory is not enabled, enable it: 

```python
operation = client.set_iam_policy(
    resource='organizations/your_organization_id',
    policy={
        'policy': {
            'bindings': [
                {
                    'role': 'roles/cloudasset.viewer',
                    'members': [
                        'user:your_email@example.com'
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
)

print("Cloud Asset Inventory has been enabled.")
```

Note: Replace `your_organization_id` and `your_email@example.com` with the appropriate values for your GCP organization and email address. Also, make sure that the service account used for authentication has the necessary permissions to enable Cloud Asset Inventory.
