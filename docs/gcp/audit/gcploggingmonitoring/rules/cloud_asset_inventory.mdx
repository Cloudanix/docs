<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the "Ensure Cloud Asset Inventory Is Enabled" misconfiguration for GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries: 

```python
!pip install google-cloud-asset google-auth
```

2. Set up authentication: 

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/your/credentials.json')
```

3. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
response = client.search_all_resources(
    scope='organizations/your_organization_id',
    asset_types=['cloudasset.googleapis.com/Asset'],
    query='resourceProperties.enableAssetDiscovery:true'
)

if len(response) > 0:
    print("Cloud Asset Inventory is already enabled.")
else:
    print("Cloud Asset Inventory is not enabled.")
```

6. If Cloud Asset Inventory is not enabled, enable it: 

```python
operation = client.set_iam_policy(
    resource='organizations/your_organization_id',
    policy={
        'policy': {
            'bindings': [
                {
                    'role': 'roles/cloudasset.viewer',
                    'members': [
                        'user:your_email@example.com'
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
)

print("Cloud Asset Inventory has been enabled.")
