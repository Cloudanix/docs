### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Logging: From the left-hand side menu, select "Logging" under the "Stackdriver" section. This will open the "Logs Viewer" page.

3. Filter Logs: In the "Logs Viewer" page, you can filter the logs based on the resource type. Select "Cloud SQL Database" from the drop-down menu in the "Resource type" field. 

4. Check Admin Activity Audit Logging: Look for logs with the log type "Admin Activity". If such logs are present, it means that Admin Activity Audit Logging is enabled. If not, it indicates that Admin Activity Audit Logging is not enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK if you haven't done so already. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions provided.

2. Once the SDK is installed and initialized, open your command line interface and use the following command to list all the projects in your Google Cloud account:

   ```
   gcloud projects list
   ```

   This will return a list of all your projects, including their PROJECT_ID, NAME, and PROJECT_NUMBER.

3. Now, you need to check the Cloud SQL Admin Activity Audit Logging for each project. Use the following command, replacing `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of the project you want to check:

   ```
   gcloud logging sinks list --project=[PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   This command will return a list of all logging sinks in the specified project. Look for a sink with the name "cloudsql.googleapis.com%2Factivity" - this is the Cloud SQL Admin Activity Audit Logging.

4. To check if the logging is enabled, look at the "destination" field of the sink. If it's set to a valid destination (like a Cloud Storage bucket, a Pub/Sub topic, or a BigQuery dataset), then the logging is enabled. If it's not set or set to an invalid destination, then the logging is not enabled.

#### Using Python

To check if Cloud SQL Admin Activity Audit Logging is enabled in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set up Google Cloud SDK and Python Environment:**
   Before you start, make sure you have Google Cloud SDK installed and configured on your system. Also, ensure that Python and necessary libraries are installed. You can install the Google Cloud Client Library for Python using pip:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-logging
   ```

2. **Import Required Libraries and Set Up Client:**
   Import the required libraries and set up the Logging client. You will need the `google.cloud` library for this.
   ```python
   from google.cloud import logging

   # Instantiates a client
   client = logging.Client()
   ```

3. **Fetch and Filter Logs:**
   Fetch the logs and filter them based on the resource type to get only the Cloud SQL Admin Activity logs. The resource type for Cloud SQL Admin Activity logs is `cloudsql_database`.
   ```python
   filter_str = 'resource.type="cloudsql_database"'
   # Retrieves a Cloud Logging handler instance
   logger = client.logger(filter_str)
   ```

4. **Check if Logging is Enabled:**
   Check if any logs are returned for the Cloud SQL Admin Activity. If logs are returned, it means that logging is enabled. If no logs are returned, it means that logging is not enabled.
   ```python
   entries = []
   for entry in logger.list_entries():  # API call
       entries.append(entry)

   if len(entries) > 0:
       print("Cloud SQL Admin Activity Audit Logging is enabled.")
   else:
       print("Cloud SQL Admin Activity Audit Logging is not enabled.")
   ```

Please note that this script only checks if any logs are present for the Cloud SQL Admin Activity. It does not check if logging is currently enabled or not. To check the current status of logging, you would need to use the Cloud SQL Admin API or the Google Cloud Console.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Cloud SQL Admin Activity Audit Logging Should Be Enabled" misconfiguration for GCP using GCP console, please follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud SQL instances page.
2. Select the instance you want to configure.
3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
4. Scroll down to the "Database flags" section.
5. Click on the "Add database flag" button.
6. In the "Flag name" field, enter "log_admin_operations".
7. In the "Flag value" field, enter "on".
8. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page.

This will enable Cloud SQL Admin Activity Audit Logging for the selected instance. The logs will be stored in Stackdriver Logging, which you can access from the Cloud Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud SQL Admin Activity Audit Logging Should Be Enabled" in GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.
2. Run the following command to enable Cloud SQL Admin Activity Audit Logging for all Cloud SQL instances in the default project:

```
gcloud sql instances patch [INSTANCE_NAME] --database-flags cloudsql.enable_iam_authorization=true,log_admin_operations=true
```

Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of your Cloud SQL instance.

3. Verify that the audit logging is enabled by running the following command:

```
gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME] --format="get(settings.databaseFlags)"
```

This command will return a list of all the database flags that are set for the Cloud SQL instance. Verify that `log_admin_operations` is set to `on`.

4. Repeat the above steps for all the Cloud SQL instances in your project.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud SQL Admin Activity Audit Logging Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Cloud SQL Admin Activity Audit Logging misconfiguration in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to import the required libraries and authenticate to your GCP account using service account credentials.

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/service/account/key.json')
service = build('logging', 'v2', credentials=credentials)
```

2. Next, you need to create a filter that will identify the Cloud SQL Admin Activity Audit logs.

```python
filter_str = 'resource.type="cloudsql_database" AND logName:"cloudsql.googleapis.com/activity" AND protoPayload.methodName:"cloudsql.*"'
```

3. Then, you need to check if there are any sinks already created for the logs.

```python
sinks = service.projects().sinks().list(
    project='your-project-id').execute()
```

4. If there are no sinks created, you can create a new sink for the logs.

```python
sink_name = 'your-sink-name'
sink_filter = 'your-filter'
destination = 'bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/your-project-id/datasets/your-dataset-id'
sink = {
    'name': sink_name,
    'filter': sink_filter,
    'destination': destination
}
response = service.projects().sinks().create(
    project='your-project-id', body=sink).execute()
```

5. Finally, you need to verify that the sink was created successfully.

```python
if 'error' in response:
    print('Error creating sink: {}'.format(response['error']))
else:
    print('Sink created successfully: {}'.format(response['name']))
```

With these steps, you can remediate the Cloud SQL Admin Activity Audit Logging misconfiguration in GCP using Python.
