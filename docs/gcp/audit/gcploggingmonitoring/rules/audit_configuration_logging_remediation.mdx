### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Logging: Once you're logged in, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines) in the top left corner of the console. Scroll down and click on "Logging" under the "Stackdriver" section.

3. Check Audit Logs: In the Logging section, click on "Logs Explorer". Here, you can view all the logs for your project. To check if Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts are enabled, you need to filter the logs. In the "Filter by label or text search" field, type "protoPayload.@type":"type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.AuditLog" and press Enter. This will filter out all the audit logs.

4. Verify Alert Configuration: To verify if alerts for configuration changes are enabled, you need to check if there are logs with "methodName" as "SetIamPolicy" or "Update". If these logs are present, it means that alerts for configuration changes are enabled. If not, it means that they are not enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website. After installation, authenticate your account using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. List all the projects: Use the following command to list all the projects in your GCP account.
   ```
   gcloud projects list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the projects along with their PROJECT_ID, NAME, and PROJECT_NUMBER.

3. List all the sinks: For each project, list all the sinks using the following command.
   ```
   gcloud logging sinks list --project=PROJECT_ID
   ```
   Replace `PROJECT_ID` with your actual project id. This command will return a list of all the sinks along with their NAME, DESTINATION, FILTER, and INCLUDE_CHILDREN.

4. Check for Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts: For each sink, check if the filter includes "protoPayload.methodName="SetIamPolicy" AND protoPayload.serviceName="cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com"". If this filter is not present, then Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts are not enabled. You can check this manually or write a script to automate this process.

#### Using Python

1. **Import Required Libraries**: The first step is to import the required libraries. For this task, we will need the `google.cloud` library. If it's not installed, you can install it using pip: `pip install google-cloud-logging`. Here is how you import it:

```python
from google.cloud import logging
```

2. **Initialize the Logging Client**: The next step is to initialize the logging client. This client will interact with the Google Cloud Logging service. Here is how you do it:

```python
client = logging.Client()
```

3. **Fetch the Sinks**: Sinks are objects that hold the configuration data for logging. We need to fetch all the sinks and check if the Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts are enabled. Here is how you fetch the sinks:

```python
sinks = list(client.list_sinks())
```

4. **Check for Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts**: Now, we need to iterate over the sinks and check if the Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts are enabled. Here is how you do it:

```python
for sink in sinks:
    if 'logName="projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity"' in sink.filter_ and 'protoPayload.methodName="SetIamPolicy"' in sink.filter_:
        print(f"Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts are enabled in sink: {sink.name}")
    else:
        print(f"Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts are not enabled in sink: {sink.name}")
```

In the above script, replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual project id. This script will print the names of the sinks where the Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts are enabled and where they are not.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" on GCP using the GCP console, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Cloud Logging page.
2. Click on "Logs-based Metrics" in the left-hand menu.
3. Click on "Create Metric" to create a new metric.
4. Give your metric a name and description, and set the filter to the following: 

    ```
    resource.type="project"
    protoPayload.methodName="SetIamPolicy"
    ```

    This filter will match any changes to the IAM policy for your project.

5. Under "Configuration", select "Create Alert from Metric".
6. Configure your alert as desired, including the notification channels you want to use.
7. Save your alert.

By following these steps, you will have enabled Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts on GCP, allowing you to be notified whenever changes are made to your project's IAM policy.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP Cloud console and navigate to the Security Command Center.
2. Click on the "Security Health Analytics" tab and select "Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts" from the list of security checks.
3. If the check is failed, click on the "Remediate" button.
4. In the "Remediation" dialog box, select the "GCP CLI" option.
5. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.
6. Run the following command to enable the audit configuration change log alerts:

```
gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME] --log-filter='resource.type="audited_resource" AND protoPayload.methodName="google.cloud.audit.AuditLogService.UpdateConfig"'
```

Note: Replace `[SINK_NAME]` with a name for the sink and `[BUCKET_NAME]` with the name of the destination bucket.

7. After running the above command, verify that the audit configuration change log alerts are enabled by running the following command:

```
gcloud logging sinks describe [SINK_NAME]
```

8. Check the output of the above command to ensure that the "logFilter" parameter is set to `resource.type="audited_resource" AND protoPayload.methodName="google.cloud.audit.AuditLogService.UpdateConfig"`.

Once the above steps are completed, the misconfiguration "Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI will be remediated.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" for GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Google Cloud SDK and authenticate with your GCP account using the following command:
```
gcloud auth login
```

2. Install the required Python libraries using the following command:
```
pip install google-cloud-logging google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2
```

3. Create a new Python script and import the required libraries:
```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

4. Create a service account with the necessary permissions to access the logs using the GCP Console.

5. Create a credentials object using the service account key file:
```python
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/keyfile.json')
```

6. Create a Logging client object:
```python
client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client(credentials=credentials)
```

7. Retrieve the current configuration for the project's logging sink:
```python
project_id = 'your-project-id'
sink_name = 'sink-name'
sink = client.get_sink(f"projects/{project_id}/sinks/{sink_name}")
```

8. Modify the configuration to enable audit configuration change log alerts:
```python
sink.filter = 'logName:cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity AND protoPayload.methodName:google.cloud.resourcemanager.v1.Projects.Update'
sink.output_version_format = 'V2'
sink.writer_identity = 'serviceAccount:cloud-logs@system.gserviceaccount.com'
sink.include_children = True
sink.create_time = None
sink.update_time = None

response = client.update_sink(sink_name, sink, unique_writer_identity=True)
```

9. Verify that the configuration has been updated by checking the sink's properties:
```python
print(response)
```

This should remediate the misconfiguration "Audit Configuration Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" for GCP using Python.
