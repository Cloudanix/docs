<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Storage Permissions Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP CLI terminal and authenticate with your GCP account using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
2. Check whether the Stackdriver Logging API is enabled or not using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud services list --enabled | grep logging.googleapis.com
   ```
   If the Stackdriver Logging API is not enabled, then enable it using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud services enable logging.googleapis.com
   ```
3. Create a sink to export logs to Cloud Pub/Sub using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_NAME] --log-filter='resource.type="gcs_bucket" AND protoPayload.methodName="storage.buckets.update" AND protoPayload.request.updateMask.fieldPaths="iamConfiguration" AND protoPayload.response.iamConfiguration' --include-children
   ```
   Replace the `[SINK_NAME]` with a name for the sink, `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of the GCP project, and `[TOPIC_NAME]` with the name of the Cloud Pub/Sub topic to export the logs to.
4. Grant the Cloud Pub/Sub Publisher role to the service account used by the sink using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=serviceAccount:[SINK_SERVICE_ACCOUNT] --role=roles/pubsub.publisher
   ```
   Replace the `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of the GCP project and `[SINK_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]` with the email address of the service account used by the sink.
5. Enable the sink using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud logging sinks update [SINK_NAME] --destination=pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_NAME] --include-children
   ```
   Replace the `[SINK_NAME]` with the name of the sink, `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of the GCP project, and `[TOPIC_NAME]` with the name of the Cloud Pub/Sub topic to export the logs to.

With the above steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Storage Permissions Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Storage Permissions Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" for GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries: 

```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2
from google.cloud.logging_v2 import enums
from google.cloud.logging_v2.resource import Resource
```

2. Set up the client:

```python
client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
```

3. Define the project ID:

```python
project_id = 'your-project-id'
```

4. Define the log sink:

```python
log_sink = 'storage-permissions-change-log-alerts'
```

5. Define the log filter:

```python
log_filter = 'logName:"cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity" AND protoPayload.methodName:"storage.buckets.update" AND protoPayload.serviceName:"storage.googleapis.com"'
```

6. Define the log sink destination:

```python
log_sink_destination = f"storage.googleapis.com/{log_sink}"
```

7. Define the log sink configuration:

```python
sink_config = {
    "name": log_sink,
    "destination": log_sink_destination,
    "filter": log_filter,
    "output_version_format": enums.LogSink.VersionFormat.V2
}
```

8. Define the log sink resource:

```python
project_resource = Resource(type="project", labels={"project_id": project_id})
```

9. Create the log sink:

```python
response = client.create_sink(project_resource.project_id, sink_config)
```

10. Verify that the log sink was created successfully:

```python
if response.name == f"projects/{project_id}/sinks/{log_sink}":
    print(f"Log sink {log_sink} created successfully.")
else:
    print(f"Failed to create log sink {log_sink}.")
```

These steps will enable the storage permissions change log alerts for GCP using Python.
