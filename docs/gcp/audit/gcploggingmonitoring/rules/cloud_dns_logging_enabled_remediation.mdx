### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Login to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in with your GCP account. If you don't have an account, you will need to create one.

2. Navigate to VPC Networks: From the GCP Console dashboard, navigate to "VPC Network" under the "Networking" section. This will display a list of all the VPC networks available in your GCP account.

3. Check for Cloud DNS Logging: For each VPC network, check if Cloud DNS Logging is enabled. This can be done by selecting the VPC network and navigating to the "Details" tab. Under the "Logging and Monitoring" section, check if "Cloud DNS Logging" is set to "Enabled". If it is not, then Cloud DNS Logging is not enabled for that VPC network.

4. Repeat for All VPC Networks: Repeat step 3 for all the VPC networks available in your GCP account. If any VPC network does not have Cloud DNS Logging enabled, then it is a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI if you haven't done so already. You can do this by following the instructions provided by Google Cloud at https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install.

2. Once the SDK is installed and configured, open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the following command to list all the VPC networks in your GCP project:

   ```
   gcloud compute networks list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all VPC networks in your project. Note down the names of the networks for the next step.

4. For each VPC network, run the following command to check if Cloud DNS logging is enabled:

   ```
   gcloud logging read "resource.type=gce_network and logName=projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Fdns_queries and resource.labels.network_name=[NETWORK_NAME]"
   ```
   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your GCP project ID and `[NETWORK_NAME]` with the name of the VPC network you noted down in the previous step.

   If the command returns any logs, it means that Cloud DNS logging is enabled for that VPC network. If it doesn't return any logs, it means that Cloud DNS logging is not enabled.

#### Using Python

1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud Logging:
   Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and authenticated with your Google Cloud account. Also, install the Python Client for Google Cloud Logging using pip:
   ```
   pip install google-cloud-logging
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the client:
   In your Python script, import the necessary libraries and initialize the Logging client. Here's an example:
   ```python
   from google.cloud import logging

   # Instantiates a client
   client = logging.Client()
   ```

3. Fetch all the VPC networks:
   Use the `networks()` method to fetch all the VPC networks in your Google Cloud project. Here's an example:
   ```python
   networks = client.networks()
   ```

4. Check if Cloud DNS logging is enabled for each VPC network:
   Iterate over each VPC network and check if Cloud DNS logging is enabled. If it's not, print a message indicating that Cloud DNS logging is not enabled for that VPC network. Here's an example:
   ```python
   for network in networks:
       if not network.logging_enabled:
           print(f"Cloud DNS logging is not enabled for VPC network {network.name}")
   ```
   This script will print a message for each VPC network where Cloud DNS logging is not enabled. If no messages are printed, that means Cloud DNS logging is enabled for all VPC networks.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Cloud DNS Logging Is Enabled For All VPC Networks" for GCP using GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP Console and select the project where you want to enable DNS logging.

2. In the left-hand navigation menu, click on "Network services" and then click on "Cloud DNS".

3. Click on the checkbox next to the DNS zone for which you want to enable logging.

4. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.

5. Scroll down to the "Logging" section and click on the "Enable" button.

6. Select the "Logs" tab and choose the logs you want to enable.

7. Click on the "Save" button to save your changes.

8. Repeat steps 3-7 for each DNS zone in your project.

By following these steps, you will enable Cloud DNS logging for all VPC networks in your GCP project.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Cloud DNS Logging Is Enabled For All VPC Networks" for GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project where the VPC networks are located.
2. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon on the top right corner of the console.
3. Run the following command to enable Cloud DNS logging for all VPC networks in the project:

   `gcloud dns managed-zones list | awk '{print "gcloud dns managed-zones update "$1" --log-dns-queries";}' | grep -v "LOGGING" | bash`

   This command will list all the managed zones in the project, and then update each managed zone with the `--log-dns-queries` flag to enable Cloud DNS logging.

4. Verify that Cloud DNS logging has been enabled for all VPC networks by running the following command:

   `gcloud dns managed-zones describe [MANAGED_ZONE_NAME]`

   Replace `[MANAGED_ZONE_NAME]` with the name of the managed zone you want to verify. Look for the `dnsQueriesLogMode` field in the output, which should be set to `ALL`.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Cloud DNS Logging Is Enabled For All VPC Networks" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate this misconfiguration in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries and authenticate with GCP:

```python
from google.cloud import dns
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('/path/to/credentials.json')
client = dns.Client(project='your-project-id', credentials=credentials)
```

2. Get a list of all VPC networks in the project:

```python
networks = client.list_networks()
```

3. For each VPC network, check if logging is enabled for Cloud DNS:

```python
for network in networks:
    dns_settings = network.dns_settings
    if dns_settings:
        if not dns_settings.logging_enabled:
            dns_settings.logging_enabled = True
            network.update()
```

4. Save the script and run it to enable Cloud DNS logging for all VPC networks in the project.

Note: Make sure to replace 'your-project-id' with the actual ID of your GCP project, and '/path/to/credentials.json' with the actual path to your service account credentials file.
