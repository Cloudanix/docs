### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Select the Project: From the drop-down menu at the top of the page, select the project for which you want to check the Project Ownership Change Log Alerts.

3. Navigate to Logging: On the left-hand side navigation menu, click on "Logging" under the "Operations" section. This will open the Logging dashboard.

4. Check for Project Ownership Change Log Alerts: In the Logging dashboard, look for the "Logs-based metrics" section. Here, you should see a list of all the log-based metrics that are currently enabled for your project. Look for a metric named "Project Ownership Change" or similar. If this metric is present and enabled, it means that Project Ownership Change Log Alerts are enabled. If not, it means they are not enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website. After downloading, you can install it by following the instructions provided. Once installed, you can initialize the SDK by running the command `gcloud init` and follow the prompts to authorize the SDK and set your default project, compute region and zone.

2. List all the sinks: To check if Project Ownership Change Log Alerts are enabled, you need to list all the sinks in your project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: `gcloud logging sinks list`. This command will return a list of all the sinks in your project.

3. Check for the existence of the sink: Now, you need to check if there is a sink that is specifically set up to alert on project ownership changes. This can be done by looking for a sink with a filter that includes "protoPayload.methodName="SetIamPolicy" AND protoPayload.serviceName="cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com"". If such a sink exists, it means that Project Ownership Change Log Alerts are enabled.

4. Check the destination of the sink: Finally, you need to check the destination of the sink. This is where the alerts will be sent. You can do this by running the following command: `gcloud logging sinks describe [SINK_NAME]`, replacing [SINK_NAME] with the name of the sink you are checking. The destination should be a Pub/Sub topic, a Cloud Storage bucket, or a BigQuery dataset where the alerts will be sent.

#### Using Python

1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Cloud Logging:
   Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Cloud Logging. You can install the Python client using pip:
   ```
   pip install google-cloud-logging
   ```

2. Authenticate your SDK:
   Use the following command to authenticate your SDK:
   ```
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
   This command will open a new browser window for you to log in to your Google account. Once you've logged in, your SDK will be authenticated.

3. Write a Python script to check if Project Ownership Change Log Alerts are enabled:
   Here is a sample script that checks if the alerts are enabled:
   ```python
   from google.cloud import logging

   def check_project_ownership_change_log_alerts():
       client = logging.Client()

       filter_str = 'protoPayload.methodName="SetIamPolicy" AND protoPayload.serviceData.policyDelta.bindingDeltas.action="ADD" AND protoPayload.serviceData.policyDelta.bindingDeltas.role="roles/owner"'
       
       for entry in client.list_entries(filter_=filter_str):  # API call
           print("Found a project ownership change log alert")
           return

       print("Project ownership change log alerts are not enabled")

   check_project_ownership_change_log_alerts()
   ```
   This script uses the `list_entries` method of the `logging.Client` class to list all log entries that match the specified filter. The filter string checks for log entries where the method name is "SetIamPolicy", the action is "ADD", and the role is "roles/owner". If such a log entry is found, it means that a project ownership change log alert has been triggered.

4. Run the Python script:
   Save the script to a file, for example `check_alerts.py`, and run it using the Python interpreter:
   ```
   python check_alerts.py
   ```
   The script will print a message indicating whether project ownership change log alerts are enabled or not.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Project Ownership Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the GCP console.
2. Navigate to the "Logging" section from the left-hand menu.
3. In the "Logging" section, click on "Logs Explorer".
4. In the "Logs Explorer" page, select the "Resource" dropdown and select the project for which you want to enable the ownership change log alerts.
5. In the search bar, type "project ownership change" and press enter.
6. From the search results, select "Admin Activity" and then select "Project Ownership Change".
7. Click on "Create Metric" and give a name to the metric.
8. Click on "Create Alert" and configure the alert as per your requirement. 
9. Click on "Save" to save the alert configuration.

By following the above steps, you will be able to enable the "Project Ownership Change Log Alerts" for the selected project in GCP.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Project Ownership Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" in GCP using GCP CLI, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.

2. Run the following command to enable project ownership change log alerts:

   ```
   gcloud alpha logging sinks create PROJECT_OWNERSHIP_CHANGE_ALERTS \
   pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/$(gcloud config get-value project)/topics/gcp-logging-alerts \
   --log-filter='resource.type="audited_resource" AND protoPayload.methodName="google.cloud.resourcemanager.v1.Projects.ChangeOwnership"' \
   --format='value(writerIdentity)'
   ```

   This command creates a new sink named `PROJECT_OWNERSHIP_CHANGE_ALERTS` that sends log entries matching the specified filter to a Pub/Sub topic named `gcp-logging-alerts`.

3. Run the following command to create a new Pub/Sub subscription for the `gcp-logging-alerts` topic:

   ```
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions create PROJECT_OWNERSHIP_CHANGE_ALERTS \
   --topic=gcp-logging-alerts \
   --ack-deadline=30 \
   --expiration-period=never
   ```

   This command creates a new subscription named `PROJECT_OWNERSHIP_CHANGE_ALERTS` for the `gcp-logging-alerts` topic with an acknowledgement deadline of 30 seconds and no expiration period.

4. Run the following command to create a new Cloud Function that processes the log entries sent to the `gcp-logging-alerts` topic:

   ```
   gcloud functions deploy process_project_ownership_change_alerts \
   --entry-point=process_log_entry \
   --runtime=python37 \
   --trigger-topic=gcp-logging-alerts \
   --memory=128MB \
   --timeout=30s \
   --env-vars-file=env.yaml \
   --source=./function
   ```

   This command deploys a new Cloud Function named `process_project_ownership_change_alerts` that processes log entries sent to the `gcp-logging-alerts` topic. The function is triggered by messages sent to the topic and has a memory limit of 128MB, a timeout of 30 seconds, and uses the `env.yaml` file to set environment variables.

5. Verify that the alerts are working by changing the ownership of a project in GCP. You should receive an alert in the Pub/Sub topic and the Cloud Function should process the log entry.

By following the above steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Project Ownership Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Project Ownership Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to import the necessary libraries. You can use the Google Cloud Client Library for Python to interact with GCP APIs. Install the library using the following command:

   ```
   pip install google-cloud-monitoring
   ```

2. Once you have installed the library, you need to authenticate your application. You can authenticate using a service account by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of the service account key file.

   ```
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service_account_key.json
   ```

3. After authentication, you can use the `google.cloud.monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient` class to enable the "Project Ownership Change Log Alerts". Use the `create_alert_policy` method to create a new alert policy for the metric `gce_instance_update`.

   ```
   from google.cloud.monitoring_v3 import AlertPolicy
   from google.cloud.monitoring_v3 import MetricServiceClient
   from google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types import AlertPolicyCondition

   client = MetricServiceClient()

   # Define the alert policy condition
   alert_condition = AlertPolicyCondition(
       metric_type="logging.googleapis.com/user/project_change",
       filter='protoPayload.methodName="SetIamPolicy"',
       duration={"seconds": 300},
       comparison={"comparison": "COMPARISON_GT", "threshold_value": 0},
       trigger={"count": 1},
       aggregations=[{"alignment_period": {"seconds": 300}, "per_series_aligner": "ALIGN_COUNT"}],
   )

   # Define the alert policy
   alert_policy = AlertPolicy(
       display_name="Project Ownership Change Log Alerts",
       combiner="OR",
       conditions=[alert_condition],
       notification_channels=[],
   )

   # Create the alert policy
   project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
   response = client.create_alert_policy(project_name, alert_policy)
   print(f"Created alert policy: {response.name}")
   ```

4. After executing the above code, the "Project Ownership Change Log Alerts" will be enabled for your GCP project.

Note: Make sure that the service account used to authenticate has the necessary permissions to create alert policies in your GCP project.
