To remediate the misconfiguration "Project Ownership Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the GCP console.
2. Navigate to the "Logging" section from the left-hand menu.
3. In the "Logging" section, click on "Logs Explorer".
4. In the "Logs Explorer" page, select the "Resource" dropdown and select the project for which you want to enable the ownership change log alerts.
5. In the search bar, type "project ownership change" and press enter.
6. From the search results, select "Admin Activity" and then select "Project Ownership Change".
7. Click on "Create Metric" and give a name to the metric.
8. Click on "Create Alert" and configure the alert as per your requirement. 
9. Click on "Save" to save the alert configuration.

By following the above steps, you will be able to enable the "Project Ownership Change Log Alerts" for the selected project in GCP.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Project Ownership Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" in GCP using GCP CLI, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.

2. Run the following command to enable project ownership change log alerts:

   ```
   gcloud alpha logging sinks create PROJECT_OWNERSHIP_CHANGE_ALERTS \
   pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/$(gcloud config get-value project)/topics/gcp-logging-alerts \
   --log-filter='resource.type="audited_resource" AND protoPayload.methodName="google.cloud.resourcemanager.v1.Projects.ChangeOwnership"' \
   --format='value(writerIdentity)'
   ```

   This command creates a new sink named `PROJECT_OWNERSHIP_CHANGE_ALERTS` that sends log entries matching the specified filter to a Pub/Sub topic named `gcp-logging-alerts`.

3. Run the following command to create a new Pub/Sub subscription for the `gcp-logging-alerts` topic:

   ```
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions create PROJECT_OWNERSHIP_CHANGE_ALERTS \
   --topic=gcp-logging-alerts \
   --ack-deadline=30 \
   --expiration-period=never
   ```

   This command creates a new subscription named `PROJECT_OWNERSHIP_CHANGE_ALERTS` for the `gcp-logging-alerts` topic with an acknowledgement deadline of 30 seconds and no expiration period.

4. Run the following command to create a new Cloud Function that processes the log entries sent to the `gcp-logging-alerts` topic:

   ```
   gcloud functions deploy process_project_ownership_change_alerts \
   --entry-point=process_log_entry \
   --runtime=python37 \
   --trigger-topic=gcp-logging-alerts \
   --memory=128MB \
   --timeout=30s \
   --env-vars-file=env.yaml \
   --source=./function
   ```

   This command deploys a new Cloud Function named `process_project_ownership_change_alerts` that processes log entries sent to the `gcp-logging-alerts` topic. The function is triggered by messages sent to the topic and has a memory limit of 128MB, a timeout of 30 seconds, and uses the `env.yaml` file to set environment variables.

5. Verify that the alerts are working by changing the ownership of a project in GCP. You should receive an alert in the Pub/Sub topic and the Cloud Function should process the log entry.

By following the above steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Project Ownership Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" in GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Project Ownership Change Log Alerts Should Be Enabled" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to import the necessary libraries. You can use the Google Cloud Client Library for Python to interact with GCP APIs. Install the library using the following command:

   ```
   pip install google-cloud-monitoring
   ```

2. Once you have installed the library, you need to authenticate your application. You can authenticate using a service account by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of the service account key file.

   ```
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service_account_key.json
   ```

3. After authentication, you can use the `google.cloud.monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient` class to enable the "Project Ownership Change Log Alerts". Use the `create_alert_policy` method to create a new alert policy for the metric `gce_instance_update`.

   ```
   from google.cloud.monitoring_v3 import AlertPolicy
   from google.cloud.monitoring_v3 import MetricServiceClient
   from google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types import AlertPolicyCondition

   client = MetricServiceClient()

   # Define the alert policy condition
   alert_condition = AlertPolicyCondition(
       metric_type="logging.googleapis.com/user/project_change",
       filter='protoPayload.methodName="SetIamPolicy"',
       duration={"seconds": 300},
       comparison={"comparison": "COMPARISON_GT", "threshold_value": 0},
       trigger={"count": 1},
       aggregations=[{"alignment_period": {"seconds": 300}, "per_series_aligner": "ALIGN_COUNT"}],
   )

   # Define the alert policy
   alert_policy = AlertPolicy(
       display_name="Project Ownership Change Log Alerts",
       combiner="OR",
       conditions=[alert_condition],
       notification_channels=[],
   )

   # Create the alert policy
   project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
   response = client.create_alert_policy(project_name, alert_policy)
   print(f"Created alert policy: {response.name}")
   ```

4. After executing the above code, the "Project Ownership Change Log Alerts" will be enabled for your GCP project.

Note: Make sure that the service account used to authenticate has the necessary permissions to create alert policies in your GCP project.
