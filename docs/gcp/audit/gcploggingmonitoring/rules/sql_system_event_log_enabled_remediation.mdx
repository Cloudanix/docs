<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud SQL System Event Audit Logging Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.

2. Run the following command to update the Cloud SQL instance to enable system event audit logging:

```
gcloud sql instances patch [INSTANCE_NAME] --database-flags log_system_events=on
```

Note: Replace [INSTANCE_NAME] with the name of your Cloud SQL instance.

3. After executing the command, verify that the system event audit logging is enabled by running the following command:

```
gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
```

4. In the output, check the value of the "databaseFlags" field. It should contain "log_system_events: on" indicating that the system event audit logging is enabled.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud SQL System Event Audit Logging Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud SQL system event audit logging should be enabled" in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to authenticate and authorize the application to access the GCP project. You can do this by following the instructions in the Google Cloud documentation.

2. Once you have authenticated and authorized the application, you need to import the required libraries in your Python code. You will need the following libraries:

```
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

3. Next, you need to create a service account key for the GCP project. You can do this by following the instructions in the Google Cloud documentation.

4. Once you have created the service account key, you need to download the key and save it in a secure location.

5. In your Python code, you can use the service account key to authenticate and authorize the application to access the GCP project. You can do this by using the following code:

```
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/service_account_key.json')
service = build('sqladmin', 'v1beta4', credentials=credentials)
```

6. After you have authenticated and authorized the application, you can use the `service` object to retrieve the configuration of the Cloud SQL instance. You can do this by using the following code:

```
project_id = 'your_project_id'
instance_name = 'your_instance_name'

instance = service.instances().get(project=project_id, instance=instance_name).execute()
```

7. Once you have retrieved the configuration of the Cloud SQL instance, you can check if system event audit logging is enabled. You can do this by checking the value of the `settings.settingsVersion` field in the `instance` object. If the value is `2`, then system event audit logging is enabled. If the value is `1`, then system event audit logging is not enabled.

```
if instance['settings']['settingsVersion'] == '1':
    # Enable system event audit logging
else:
    # System event audit logging is already enabled
```

8. To enable system event audit logging, you need to update the configuration of the Cloud SQL instance. You can do this by using the following code:

```
instance['settings']['settingsVersion'] = '2'

update_request = service.instances().update(project=project_id, instance=instance_name, body=instance)
update_request.execute()
```

9. After you have updated the configuration of the Cloud SQL instance, you can verify that system event audit logging is enabled by checking the value of the `settings.settingsVersion` field in the `instance` object.

```
if instance['settings']['settingsVersion'] == '2':
    # System event audit logging is enabled
else:
    # Failed to enable system event audit logging
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud SQL system event audit logging should be enabled" in GCP using Python.
