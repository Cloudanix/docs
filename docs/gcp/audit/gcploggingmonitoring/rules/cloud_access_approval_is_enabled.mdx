#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Access Approval Is Enabled" in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
from google.cloud import accessapproval_v1
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

2. Create a service account and grant it the necessary permissions to access the Access Approval API.

```
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/service_account.json')
client = accessapproval_v1.AccessApprovalClient(credentials=credentials)
```

3. Get the current Access Approval settings:

```
response = client.get_access_approval_settings(request={"name": "projects/<project_id>/accessApprovalSettings"})
```

4. Check if Access Approval is enabled or not:

```
if response.enforcement_mode == accessapproval_v1.EnforcementMode.ENFORCEMENT_MODE_UNSPECIFIED:
    response.enforcement_mode = accessapproval_v1.EnforcementMode.ENFORCEMENT_MODE_ENABLED
    response = client.update_access_approval_settings(request={"access_approval_settings": response})
```

5. If Access Approval is not enabled, enable it:

```
response.enforcement_mode = accessapproval_v1.EnforcementMode.ENFORCEMENT_MODE_ENABLED
response = client.update_access_approval_settings(request={"access_approval_settings": response})
```

6. Verify that Access Approval is enabled:

```
if response.enforcement_mode == accessapproval_v1.EnforcementMode.ENFORCEMENT_MODE_ENABLED:
    print("Access Approval is enabled.")
else:
    print("Failed to enable Access Approval.")
```

Note: Replace `<project_id>` with your actual project ID.

These steps will ensure that Access Approval is enabled in GCP using Python.
