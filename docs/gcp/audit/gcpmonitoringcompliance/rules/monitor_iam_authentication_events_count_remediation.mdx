### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring IAM authentication events count in GCP, you can follow the below steps using GCP console:

1. Go to the GCP console and navigate to the "Security Command Center" page.
2. Click on the "Dashboard" tab and select the project for which you want to enable monitoring for IAM authentication events count.
3. On the dashboard, you will see a list of security findings. Look for the finding titled "IAM Authentication Events Count" and click on it.
4. In the finding details page, click on the "Remediation" tab.
5. Under the "Remediation steps" section, you will see the steps to enable monitoring for IAM authentication events count.
6. Follow the steps to enable monitoring for IAM authentication events count.

Note: Enabling monitoring for IAM authentication events count in GCP involves setting up logs-based metrics and creating an alerting policy. These steps are outlined in the remediation steps section mentioned above.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring IAM authentication events count in GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal and ensure that you have installed and authenticated the GCP CLI.

2. Run the following command to enable the monitoring of IAM authentication events count:

```
gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] \ 
  bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET_NAME] \ 
  --log-filter='resource.type="audited_resource" AND protoPayload.methodName="google.iam.v1.IAM.CheckPolicy"' \ 
  --include-children \
  --format='value(sink)'
```

Replace `[SINK_NAME]` with a name for the sink, `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of your GCP project, and `[DATASET_NAME]` with the name of the BigQuery dataset where you want to store the logs.

3. Run the following command to grant the required permissions to the sink:

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] \
  --member=serviceAccount:[SINK_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] \
  --role=roles/bigquery.dataEditor
```

Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of your GCP project and `[SINK_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]` with the email address of the service account that will be used to write logs to BigQuery.

4. Run the following command to verify that the sink has been created successfully:

```
gcloud logging sinks list
```

This command will list all the sinks in your GCP project.

5. Run the following command to test the sink:

```
gcloud logging write [LOG_NAME] '{ "message": "Testing GCP IAM authentication event logging" }' \
  --severity=NOTICE \
  --log-name=cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity \
  --payload-type=json
```

Replace `[LOG_NAME]` with a name for the log.

6. Finally, verify that the logs have been successfully written to BigQuery by running the following command:

```
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'SELECT * FROM [DATASET_NAME].[TABLE_NAME] WHERE logName="cloudaudit.googleapis.com/activity" AND protoPayload.methodName="google.iam.v1.IAM.CheckPolicy"'
```

Replace `[DATASET_NAME]` with the name of the BigQuery dataset and `[TABLE_NAME]` with the name of the table where the logs are stored.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring IAM authentication events count in GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring IAM authentication events count in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries: Install the Google Cloud IAM API client library using the following command:

```python
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-iam
```

2. Set up authentication: To access the GCP resources, you need to set up authentication. You can do this by creating a service account and downloading its key file. Then, set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of the key file.

```python
import os

os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "/path/to/keyfile.json"
```

3. Create a client: Create a client object to interact with the IAM API.

```python
from google.cloud import iam_v1

client = iam_v1.IAMClient()
```

4. Get the project ID: Get the project ID where you want to monitor the IAM authentication events.

```python
project_id = "your-project-id"
```

5. Create a metric descriptor: Create a metric descriptor for the IAM authentication events count.

```python
from google.api import metric_pb2
from google.cloud.monitoring_v3 import MetricServiceClient
from google.protobuf import descriptor_pb2

client = MetricServiceClient()

project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
descriptor = metric_pb2.MetricDescriptor()
descriptor.type = "custom.googleapis.com/iam/authentication_events_count"
descriptor.metric_kind = metric_pb2.MetricDescriptor.MetricKind.CUMULATIVE
descriptor.value_type = metric_pb2.MetricDescriptor.ValueType.INT64
descriptor.description = "The count of IAM authentication events"
descriptor.unit = "1"
descriptor.name = f"{project_name}/metricDescriptors/custom.googleapis.com/iam/authentication_events_count"
descriptor.labels.append(key="auth_method", value_type=descriptor_pb2.STRING)
descriptor.labels.append(key="auth_principal_email", value_type=descriptor_pb2.STRING)

descriptor = client.create_metric_descriptor(name=project_name, metric_descriptor=descriptor)
```

6. Create a time series: Create a time series for the metric descriptor to monitor the IAM authentication events count.

```python
from google.api import metric_pb2
from google.cloud.monitoring_v3 import MetricServiceClient
from google.protobuf import timestamp_pb2

client = MetricServiceClient()

project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
descriptor_name = f"{project_name}/metricDescriptors/custom.googleapis.com/iam/authentication_events_count"
start_time = timestamp_pb2.Timestamp()
start_time.GetCurrentTime()

time_series = metric_pb2.TimeSeries()
time_series.metric.type = descriptor_name
time_series.resource.type = "global"
time_series.metric.labels["auth_method"] = "IAM"
time_series.metric.labels["auth_principal_email"] = "all"
point = time_series.points.add()
point.value.int64_value = 0
point.interval.end_time.seconds = start_time.seconds
point.interval.end_time.nanos = start_time.nanos

time_series = client.create_time_series(name=project_name, time_series=[time_series])
```

7. Verify the monitoring: Verify that the monitoring is set up correctly by checking the metric in the Cloud Console or by using the following command:

```python
from google.cloud.monitoring_v3 import MetricServiceClient
from google.api import metric_pb2
from google.protobuf import timestamp_pb2

client = MetricServiceClient()

project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
metric_type = "custom.googleapis.com/iam/authentication_events_count"
start_time = timestamp_pb2.Timestamp()
end_time = timestamp_pb2.Timestamp()

start_time.FromMilliseconds(int((time.time() - 3600) * 1000))
end_time.GetCurrentTime()

interval = metric_pb2.TimeInterval()
interval.start_time.seconds = start_time.seconds
interval.start_time.nanos = start_time.nanos
interval.end_time.seconds = end_time.seconds
interval.end_time.nanos = end_time.nanos

results = client.list_time_series(
    name=project_name,
    filter=f'metric.type="{metric_type}"',
    interval=interval,
    view=metric_pb2.ListTimeSeriesRequest.TimeSeriesView.FULL,
)

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

These steps will remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring IAM authentication events count in GCP using Python.
