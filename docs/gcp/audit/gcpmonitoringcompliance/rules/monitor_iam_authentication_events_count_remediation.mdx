### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser and navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com). Enter your login credentials to access your GCP account.

2. Navigate to Cloud Monitoring: Once you're logged in, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines) located at the top left corner of the console. Scroll down and click on "Monitoring" under the "Operations" section.

3. Create or Select a Dashboard: In the Cloud Monitoring page, you can either create a new dashboard or select an existing one. To create a new dashboard, click on "Dashboard" and then "Create Dashboard". If you want to use an existing dashboard, just click on its name.

4. Add IAM Authentication Events Metric: To monitor IAM Authentication Events, you need to add a new metric to the dashboard. Click on "Add Metric", then select "IAM" from the "Resource Type" dropdown. Next, select "Authentication Events Count" from the "Metric" dropdown. Configure the other settings as per your requirements and click "Save". Now, the dashboard will start monitoring the IAM Authentication Events Count.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, authenticate your Google Cloud account by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. After successful authentication, you can list all the metrics descriptors available in your Google Cloud Monitoring by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud monitoring metrics-descriptors list
   ```

3. To check if Cloud Monitoring is monitoring IAM Authentication Events Count, you need to look for the specific metric descriptor related to IAM Authentication Events. You can do this by filtering the list of metric descriptors with the following command:

   ```
   gcloud monitoring metrics-descriptors list | grep "iam.googleapis.com"
   ```

4. If the IAM Authentication Events Count metric descriptor is present in the output, it means that Cloud Monitoring is monitoring IAM Authentication Events. If not, it means that it is not being monitored.

#### Using Python

1. **AWS:**

   - Install the AWS SDK (Boto3) for Python. You can do this by running `pip install boto3`.
   - Use the CloudTrail service to monitor IAM authentication events. Here is a sample script:

```python
import boto3

def detect_misconfiguration():
    client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
    response = client.lookup_events(
        LookupAttributes=[
            {
                'AttributeKey': 'EventName',
                'AttributeValue': 'ConsoleLogin'
            },
        ],
    )
    return response['Events']

events = detect_misconfiguration()
print(len(events))
```

2. **Azure:**

   - Install the Azure SDK for Python. You can do this by running `pip install azure`.
   - Use the Azure Monitor service to monitor IAM authentication events. Here is a sample script:

```python
from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

def detect_misconfiguration():
    credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
        client_id = 'your_client_id',
        secret = 'your_secret',
        tenant = 'your_tenant_id'
    )
    client = MonitorManagementClient(credentials, 'your_subscription_id')
    activity_logs = client.activity_logs.list(
        filter="eventTimestamp ge '2020-06-01T00:00:00Z' and eventTimestamp le '2020-06-02T00:00:00Z' and operationName eq 'Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write'"
    )
    return activity_logs

logs = detect_misconfiguration()
print(len(list(logs)))
```

3. **GCP:**

   - Install the Google Cloud SDK for Python. You can do this by running `pip install google-cloud-sdk`.
   - Use the Stackdriver service to monitor IAM authentication events. Here is a sample script:

```python
from google.cloud import logging

def detect_misconfiguration():
    client = logging.Client()
    filter_str = 'resource.type="gce_instance" AND logName:"logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Factivity_log"'
    entries = client.list_entries(filter_=filter_str)  # API call
    return entries

entries = detect_misconfiguration()
print(len(list(entries)))
```

These scripts will return the number of IAM authentication events. If the number is unexpectedly high, it may indicate a misconfiguration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring IAM authentication events count in GCP, you can follow the below steps using GCP console:

1. Go to the GCP console and navigate to the "Security Command Center" page.
2. Click on the "Dashboard" tab and select the project for which you want to enable monitoring for IAM authentication events count.
3. On the dashboard, you will see a list of security findings. Look for the finding titled "IAM Authentication Events Count" and click on it.
4. In the finding details page, click on the "Remediation" tab.
5. Under the "Remediation steps" section, you will see the steps to enable monitoring for IAM authentication events count.
6. Follow the steps to enable monitoring for IAM authentication events count.

Note: Enabling monitoring for IAM authentication events count in GCP involves setting up logs-based metrics and creating an alerting policy. These steps are outlined in the remediation steps section mentioned above.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring IAM authentication events count in GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal and ensure that you have installed and authenticated the GCP CLI.

2. Run the following command to enable the monitoring of IAM authentication events count:

```
gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] \ 
  bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET_NAME] \ 
  --log-filter='resource.type="audited_resource" AND protoPayload.methodName="google.iam.v1.IAM.CheckPolicy"' \ 
  --include-children \
  --format='value(sink)'
```

Replace `[SINK_NAME]` with a name for the sink, `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of your GCP project, and `[DATASET_NAME]` with the name of the BigQuery dataset where you want to store the logs.

3. Run the following command to grant the required permissions to the sink:

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] \
  --member=serviceAccount:[SINK_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] \
  --role=roles/bigquery.dataEditor
```

Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of your GCP project and `[SINK_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]` with the email address of the service account that will be used to write logs to BigQuery.

4. Run the following command to verify that the sink has been created successfully:

```
gcloud logging sinks list
```

This command will list all the sinks in your GCP project.

5. Run the following command to test the sink:

```
gcloud logging write [LOG_NAME] '{ "message": "Testing GCP IAM authentication event logging" }' \
  --severity=NOTICE \
  --log-name=cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity \
  --payload-type=json
```

Replace `[LOG_NAME]` with a name for the log.

6. Finally, verify that the logs have been successfully written to BigQuery by running the following command:

```
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'SELECT * FROM [DATASET_NAME].[TABLE_NAME] WHERE logName="cloudaudit.googleapis.com/activity" AND protoPayload.methodName="google.iam.v1.IAM.CheckPolicy"'
```

Replace `[DATASET_NAME]` with the name of the BigQuery dataset and `[TABLE_NAME]` with the name of the table where the logs are stored.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring IAM authentication events count in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring IAM authentication events count in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries: Install the Google Cloud IAM API client library using the following command:

```python
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-iam
```

2. Set up authentication: To access the GCP resources, you need to set up authentication. You can do this by creating a service account and downloading its key file. Then, set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of the key file.

```python
import os

os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "/path/to/keyfile.json"
```

3. Create a client: Create a client object to interact with the IAM API.

```python
from google.cloud import iam_v1

client = iam_v1.IAMClient()
```

4. Get the project ID: Get the project ID where you want to monitor the IAM authentication events.

```python
project_id = "your-project-id"
```

5. Create a metric descriptor: Create a metric descriptor for the IAM authentication events count.

```python
from google.api import metric_pb2
from google.cloud.monitoring_v3 import MetricServiceClient
from google.protobuf import descriptor_pb2

client = MetricServiceClient()

project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
descriptor = metric_pb2.MetricDescriptor()
descriptor.type = "custom.googleapis.com/iam/authentication_events_count"
descriptor.metric_kind = metric_pb2.MetricDescriptor.MetricKind.CUMULATIVE
descriptor.value_type = metric_pb2.MetricDescriptor.ValueType.INT64
descriptor.description = "The count of IAM authentication events"
descriptor.unit = "1"
descriptor.name = f"{project_name}/metricDescriptors/custom.googleapis.com/iam/authentication_events_count"
descriptor.labels.append(key="auth_method", value_type=descriptor_pb2.STRING)
descriptor.labels.append(key="auth_principal_email", value_type=descriptor_pb2.STRING)

descriptor = client.create_metric_descriptor(name=project_name, metric_descriptor=descriptor)
```

6. Create a time series: Create a time series for the metric descriptor to monitor the IAM authentication events count.

```python
from google.api import metric_pb2
from google.cloud.monitoring_v3 import MetricServiceClient
from google.protobuf import timestamp_pb2

client = MetricServiceClient()

project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
descriptor_name = f"{project_name}/metricDescriptors/custom.googleapis.com/iam/authentication_events_count"
start_time = timestamp_pb2.Timestamp()
start_time.GetCurrentTime()

time_series = metric_pb2.TimeSeries()
time_series.metric.type = descriptor_name
time_series.resource.type = "global"
time_series.metric.labels["auth_method"] = "IAM"
time_series.metric.labels["auth_principal_email"] = "all"
point = time_series.points.add()
point.value.int64_value = 0
point.interval.end_time.seconds = start_time.seconds
point.interval.end_time.nanos = start_time.nanos

time_series = client.create_time_series(name=project_name, time_series=[time_series])
```

7. Verify the monitoring: Verify that the monitoring is set up correctly by checking the metric in the Cloud Console or by using the following command:

```python
from google.cloud.monitoring_v3 import MetricServiceClient
from google.api import metric_pb2
from google.protobuf import timestamp_pb2

client = MetricServiceClient()

project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
metric_type = "custom.googleapis.com/iam/authentication_events_count"
start_time = timestamp_pb2.Timestamp()
end_time = timestamp_pb2.Timestamp()

start_time.FromMilliseconds(int((time.time() - 3600) * 1000))
end_time.GetCurrentTime()

interval = metric_pb2.TimeInterval()
interval.start_time.seconds = start_time.seconds
interval.start_time.nanos = start_time.nanos
interval.end_time.seconds = end_time.seconds
interval.end_time.nanos = end_time.nanos

results = client.list_time_series(
    name=project_name,
    filter=f'metric.type="{metric_type}"',
    interval=interval,
    view=metric_pb2.ListTimeSeriesRequest.TimeSeriesView.FULL,
)

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

These steps will remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring IAM authentication events count in GCP using Python.
