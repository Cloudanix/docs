### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console: Navigate to the GCP console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google account that has the necessary permissions to access the GCP resources.

2. Navigate to Cloud Monitoring: On the GCP console dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines on the top left corner), scroll down and click on "Monitoring" under the "Operations" section.

3. Check Uptime Checks: In the Cloud Monitoring dashboard, click on "Uptime checks" in the left-hand menu. This will display a list of all the uptime checks that have been configured for your GCP resources.

4. Verify Database Uptime Check: Look for the uptime check that is supposed to monitor your database. If it's not there, then it means the uptime check for the database has not been configured. If it is there, click on it to view its details and ensure it's properly configured to monitor your database.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK if you haven't done so already. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, you can initialize it using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud init
   ```

2. After initializing the Google Cloud SDK, you can list all the uptime checks configured in your project using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud beta monitoring uptime-checks list
   ```

3. To check the details of a specific uptime check, you can use the following command:

   ```
   gcloud beta monitoring uptime-checks describe [CHECK_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[CHECK_ID]` with the ID of the uptime check you want to inspect.

4. If you want to check the uptime of a specific database, you need to ensure that the uptime check is configured to monitor the correct resource and service. This information can be found in the output of the `describe` command. The `monitoredResource` field should contain the resource type and resource labels that identify the database, and the `check` field should contain the details of the check, such as the protocol, port, and path. 

   If the uptime check is not configured correctly, it means there is a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. **Import Required Libraries**: The first step is to import the required libraries. For this task, we will need the `google-cloud-monitoring` library. If you don't have it installed, you can do so using pip: `pip install google-cloud-monitoring`. Here is how you import it:

```python
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3
```

2. **Initialize the Client**: The next step is to initialize the client. You will need to authenticate using your GCP credentials. Here is how you do it:

```python
client = monitoring_v3.UptimeCheckServiceClient()
project_name = client.common_project_path('your-project-id')
```

3. **List Uptime Checks**: Now, we can list all the uptime checks for the project. This will return a list of all the uptime checks. Here is how you do it:

```python
uptime_checks = list(client.list_uptime_check_configs(project_name))
```

4. **Check for Database Uptime Check**: Finally, we can iterate over the list of uptime checks and check if there is an uptime check for the database. Here is how you do it:

```python
database_uptime_check_exists = False

for uptime_check in uptime_checks:
    if 'database' in uptime_check.display_name.lower():
        database_uptime_check_exists = True
        break

print('Database Uptime Check Exists: ', database_uptime_check_exists)
```

This script will print `True` if a database uptime check exists and `False` otherwise.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring database uptime check in GCP using the GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud SQL instances page.

2. Select the instance that you want to monitor and click on the "Edit" button.

3. Scroll down to the "Alerting" section and click on the "Add alerting policy" button.

4. In the "Add alerting policy" dialog box, select "Metric" as the "Condition type".

5. From the "Metric" drop-down list, select "Cloud SQL Database".

6. From the "Metric type" drop-down list, select "Uptime Check".

7. In the "Filter" section, select the specific database that you want to monitor.

8. In the "Condition" section, set the threshold for the uptime check that you want to monitor.

9. Click on the "Add" button to create the alerting policy.

10. Finally, click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, you will receive an alert if the database uptime check falls below the threshold that you have set. This will help you to ensure that your database is always available and accessible to your users.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring the database uptime check in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud SQL instances page.
2. Select the instance that you want to monitor and click on the "Edit" button.
3. In the "Settings" section, click on the "Monitoring" tab.
4. Scroll down to the "Uptime check" section and click on the "Add uptime check" button.
5. In the "Add uptime check" dialog box, enter the following information:
   - Check name: A descriptive name for the uptime check.
   - Resource type: Select "Cloud SQL instance" from the dropdown menu.
   - Resource name: Select the name of the instance that you want to monitor.
   - Protocol: Select "HTTP" or "HTTPS" depending on your needs.
   - Request path: Enter "/". This will check if the server is responding to requests.
   - Port: Enter the port number that the database is running on (default is 3306).
   - Monitoring interval: Select how often you want to check the uptime (e.g. every 1 minute).
   - Timeout: Select the maximum amount of time that the check should wait for a response (e.g. 5 seconds).
6. Click on the "Save" button to add the uptime check to the instance.
7. Verify that the uptime check is working by checking the "Uptime checks" tab in the Cloud SQL instance details page.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring the database uptime check in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring database uptime check on GCP, you can follow the below steps using Python:

1. First, you need to create a Cloud Monitoring uptime check for your database. You can do this using the Google Cloud Console or the Cloud Monitoring API. Here is an example Python code to create an uptime check using the Cloud Monitoring API:

```python
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3

client = monitoring_v3.UptimeCheckServiceClient()

project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
config = monitoring_v3.types.UptimeCheckConfig(
    display_name="Database Uptime Check",
    resource=monitoring_v3.types.MonitoredResource(
        type="cloudsql_database",
        labels={
            "project_id": project_id,
            "database_id": database_id
        }
    ),
    http_check=monitoring_v3.types.UptimeCheckConfig.HttpCheck(
        path="/",
        port=5432,
        use_ssl=False
    ),
    timeout=monitoring_v3.types.Duration(seconds=10),
    period=monitoring_v3.types.Duration(seconds=60),
    content_matchers=[
        monitoring_v3.types.UptimeCheckConfig.ContentMatcher(
            content="Database is up",
            matcher=monitoring_v3.types.UptimeCheckConfig.ContentMatcher.Matcher.REGEXP_MATCH
        )
    ]
)

response = client.create_uptime_check_config(request={"parent": project_name, "uptime_check_config": config})
print("Uptime check created: ", response)
```

This code creates an uptime check for a Cloud SQL database, which checks the database's root URL every minute and looks for the string "Database is up" in the response.

2. Once you have created the uptime check, you need to create a notification channel to receive alerts if the check fails. You can do this using the Cloud Monitoring API or the Google Cloud Console. Here is an example Python code to create a notification channel using the Cloud Monitoring API:

```python
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3

client = monitoring_v3.NotificationChannelServiceClient()

project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
channel = monitoring_v3.types.NotificationChannel(
    type_="email",
    display_name="Database Alert",
    labels={
        "email_address": "youremail@example.com"
    },
    user_labels={
        "severity": "high"
    }
)

response = client.create_notification_channel(request={"name": project_name, "notification_channel": channel})
print("Notification channel created: ", response)
```

This code creates an email notification channel for the email address "youremail@example.com" and sets the severity label to "high".

3. Finally, you need to create an alerting policy that uses the uptime check and notification channel to send alerts if the database goes down. You can do this using the Cloud Monitoring API or the Google Cloud Console. Here is an example Python code to create an alerting policy using the Cloud Monitoring API:

```python
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3

client = monitoring_v3.AlertPolicyServiceClient()

project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
policy = monitoring_v3.types.AlertPolicy(
    display_name="Database Alert Policy",
    combiner=monitoring_v3.types.AlertPolicy.ConditionCombinerType.AND,
    conditions=[
        monitoring_v3.types.AlertPolicy.Condition(
            display_name="Database Down",
            condition_threshold=monitoring_v3.types.AlertPolicy.Condition.MetricThreshold(
                filter='metric.type="cloudsql_database/uptime_ratio"',
                threshold_value=0.99,
                comparison=monitoring_v3.types.ComparisonType.LESS_THAN,
                duration=monitoring_v3.types.Duration(seconds=300),
                trigger=monitoring_v3.types.AlertPolicy.Condition.Trigger(
                    count=1,
                    percent=0.0
                )
            ),
            duration=monitoring_v3.types.Duration(seconds=0),
            trigger=monitoring_v3.types.AlertPolicy.Condition.Trigger(
                count=1,
                percent=0.0
            )
        )
    ],
    notification_channels=["projects/{project_id}/notificationChannels/{channel_id}".format(project_id=project_id, channel_id=channel_id)],
    documentation=monitoring_v3.types.AlertPolicy.Documentation(content="Database is down alert.")
)

response = client.create_alert_policy(request={"name": project_name, "alert_policy": policy})
print("Alerting policy created: ", response)
```

This code creates an alerting policy that triggers when the uptime ratio of the Cloud SQL database drops below 99% for 5 minutes. The policy sends an email notification to the "youremail@example.com" address when triggered.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring database uptime check on GCP using Python.
