### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform web page and sign in to your account.

2. Navigate to Monitoring: From the GCP Console, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner). Scroll down and click on "Monitoring" under the "Operations" section.

3. Check the Uptime Checks: In the Monitoring dashboard, click on "Uptime checks" under the "Alerting" section. This will display a list of all the uptime checks configured for your project.

4. Inspect Headers: Click on each uptime check to inspect its details. Look for the "Headers" section in the "Request" part of the check. If any sensitive information like authentication tokens, passwords, or other private data is visible in the headers, then the headers are not being masked properly.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website. After downloading, you can install it by following the instructions provided. Once installed, you need to authenticate your Google Cloud account by running the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. List all the monitoring uptime checks: Run the following command to list all the uptime checks in your project:

    ```
    gcloud beta monitoring uptime-checks list
    ```
   This command will return a list of all the uptime checks in your project. Each uptime check will have a unique ID.

3. Get the details of each uptime check: For each uptime check, run the following command to get its details:

    ```
    gcloud beta monitoring uptime-checks describe [CHECK_ID]
    ```
   Replace `[CHECK_ID]` with the ID of the uptime check. This command will return the details of the uptime check, including the headers used in the check.

4. Check the headers: In the output of the previous command, look for the `headers` field. If the `Authorization` header is present and its value is not masked, then the monitoring is not masking headers for HTTPS requests.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you need to install the Google Cloud SDK and the Python client library. You can install these using pip:

   ```python
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-sdk
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-monitoring
   ```

2. Authenticate your GCP account: Before you can interact with GCP, you need to authenticate your account. You can do this by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key JSON file:

   ```python
   import os
   os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
   ```

3. Create a client for the Monitoring service: Once you've authenticated your account, you can create a client for the Monitoring service. This client will allow you to interact with the Monitoring API:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import monitoring_v3
   client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient()
   ```

4. Check the mask headers setting: Now you can use the client to check the mask headers setting for HTTPS requests. You can do this by calling the `list_monitored_resource_descriptors` method on the client and checking the `mask_headers` field of the returned descriptors:

   ```python
   project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
   descriptors = client.list_monitored_resource_descriptors(name=project_name)
   for descriptor in descriptors:
       if descriptor.type == "https":
           print(f"Mask headers for HTTPS requests: {descriptor.mask_headers}")
   ```
   
Please note that the `mask_headers` field might not be directly available in the descriptor object. The actual implementation might vary based on the actual structure of the descriptor object.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Should Mask Headers For HTTPS Requests" for GCP using GCP console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Cloud Monitoring page.

2. Click on the "Uptime Checks" option on the left-hand side menu.

3. Select the HTTPS uptime check for which you want to mask headers.

4. Click on the "Edit" button to edit the uptime check.

5. Under the "Request" section, click on the "Add Header" button to add a new header.

6. Enter the header name as "X-Goog-Monitoring-Mask-Headers" and the header value as a comma-separated list of headers that you want to mask.

7. Save the changes by clicking on the "Save" button.

8. Verify that the headers are masked by checking the monitoring logs.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Should Mask Headers For HTTPS Requests" for GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Cloud Monitoring Should Mask Headers For HTTPS Requests" misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and go to the Cloud Shell.

2. Run the following command to enable the Cloud Monitoring API:

```
gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com
```

3. Run the following command to create a new metric descriptor for masking headers:

```
gcloud monitoring metric-descriptors create "custom.googleapis.com/https/masked_headers" --type=custom.googleapis.com/https/masked_headers --metric-kind=GAUGE --value-type=BOOL --description="Indicates whether headers are masked for HTTPS requests."
```

4. Run the following command to create a new alert policy that will trigger when the "masked_headers" metric is false:

```
gcloud alpha monitoring policies create --display-name="HTTPS Masked Headers Alert" --conditions="metric.type=\"custom.googleapis.com/https/masked_headers\" AND metric.bool_value=false" --notification-channels=<your-notification-channel>
```

Make sure to replace `<your-notification-channel>` with the name or ID of the notification channel you want to use.

5. Run the following command to verify that the alert policy was created successfully:

```
gcloud alpha monitoring policies list
```

You should see the "HTTPS Masked Headers Alert" policy listed.

By following these steps, you have remediated the "Cloud Monitoring Should Mask Headers For HTTPS Requests" misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Should Mask Headers For HTTPS Requests" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Install the necessary libraries and authenticate to GCP using the following commands:

```
!pip install google-cloud-monitoring google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2
from google.oauth2 import service_account
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path_to_service_account_key_file>')
```

Step 2: Create a client object for Cloud Monitoring API:

```
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3
client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient(credentials=credentials)
```

Step 3: Define the metric descriptor for masking headers:

```
metric_descriptor = monitoring_v3.types.MetricDescriptor()
metric_descriptor.type = 'custom.googleapis.com/http_masked_headers'
metric_descriptor.metric_kind = monitoring_v3.enums.MetricDescriptor.MetricKind.GAUGE
metric_descriptor.value_type = monitoring_v3.enums.MetricDescriptor.ValueType.BOOL
metric_descriptor.description = 'Indicates whether headers in HTTPS requests are masked'
metric_descriptor.display_name = 'HTTPS Masked Headers'
```

Step 4: Create the metric descriptor using the client object:

```
project_name = 'projects/<project_id>'
response = client.create_metric_descriptor(name=project_name, metric_descriptor=metric_descriptor)
```

Step 5: Verify that the metric descriptor has been created successfully:

```
print(response)
```

Step 6: Create a time series for the metric:

```
series = monitoring_v3.types.TimeSeries()
series.metric.type = 'custom.googleapis.com/http_masked_headers'
series.resource.type = 'global'
series.value.bool_value = True
series.metric.labels['method'] = 'https'
```

Step 7: Write the time series to Cloud Monitoring API:

```
client.create_time_series(name=project_name, time_series=[series])
```

Step 8: Verify that the time series has been created successfully:

```
print('Time series created: {}'.format(series))
```

After completing these steps, the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Should Mask Headers For HTTPS Requests" should be remediated for GCP using Python.
