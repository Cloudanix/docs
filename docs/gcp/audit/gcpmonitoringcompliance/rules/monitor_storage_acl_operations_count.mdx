### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console: Open your web browser and navigate to the GCP Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google Cloud credentials.

2. Navigate to Monitoring: From the GCP Console dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner). Scroll down and click on "Monitoring" under the "Operations" section.

3. Access Metrics Explorer: In the Monitoring dashboard, click on "Metrics Explorer" on the left-hand side menu. This will open the Metrics Explorer where you can view and analyze your cloud metrics.

4. Check Storage ACL Operations Count: In the Metrics Explorer, select "Cloud Storage" as the resource type and "ACL Operations Count" as the metric. This will display a graph showing the count of ACL operations over time. You can adjust the time range and aggregation settings to suit your needs. If there are any unusual spikes or patterns in the graph, it may indicate a misconfiguration or security issue.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate the Google Cloud SDK: The Google Cloud SDK includes the gcloud command-line tool, which is necessary to interact with GCP services. You can install it by following the instructions provided by Google Cloud. After installation, you need to authenticate your Google Cloud account using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. Enable the Monitoring API: Before you can use the Monitoring service, you need to enable its API. You can do this with the following command: `gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com`.

3. List all the metrics descriptors: You can list all the metrics descriptors available in your project using the following command: `gcloud beta monitoring metrics-descriptors list --project=[PROJECT_ID]`. Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual project ID. This command will return a list of all metrics descriptors, including the one for Storage ACL Operations Count.

4. Filter the metrics descriptors: To find the specific metric for Storage ACL Operations Count, you can filter the list of metrics descriptors. Use the following command: `gcloud beta monitoring metrics-descriptors list --filter="metric.type='storage.googleapis.com/acl/operations_count'" --project=[PROJECT_ID]`. This command will return the metric descriptor for Storage ACL Operations Count if it exists. If it doesn't, you may need to create it or enable it in your project.

#### Using Python

1. **Import Required Libraries**: The first step is to import the required libraries. For this task, we will need the `google.cloud` library. If you don't have it installed, you can do so using pip: `pip install google-cloud-monitoring`. Here is how you import it:

```python
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3
```

2. **Initialize the Client**: The next step is to initialize the client. You will need to authenticate using your Google Cloud credentials. Here is how you do it:

```python
client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient()
project_name = client.project_path("your-project-id")
```

3. **Create the Filter**: Now, we need to create a filter to get the metrics we want. In this case, we want to monitor Storage ACL operations count. Here is how you create the filter:

```python
filter = 'metric.type="storage.googleapis.com/network/request_count" AND metric.labels.operation_type="storage.buckets.update"'
```

4. **Get the Metrics**: Finally, we can get the metrics using the `list_time_series` method. This method returns a list of time series that match the filter. Here is how you do it:

```python
response = client.list_time_series(
    project_name,
    '2021-01-01T00:00:00.00Z',  # Start time
    '2021-12-31T23:59:59.99Z',  # End time
    monitoring_v3.enums.ListTimeSeriesRequest.TimeSeriesView.FULL,
    filter=filter,
)
for time_series in response:
    print(time_series)
```

This script will print all the time series that match the filter, which in this case are the Storage ACL operations count. You can adjust the start and end time to the period you want to monitor.

9. Once the user or service account has been added, navigate to the "Monitoring" section of the storage bucket.
10. In the "Monitoring" section, click on the "Create Policy" button.
11. Enter a name for the policy and select the "Metric" option.
12. In the "Filter" section, select the "Storage > Bucket" option from the dropdown menu.
13. Select the storage bucket for which you want to monitor the ACL operations count.
14. In the "Condition" section, select the "Metric Threshold" option.
15. Set the threshold value for the ACL operations count and select the time interval for which you want to monitor the metric.
16. Click on the "Save" button to save the policy.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring Storage ACL Operations Count in GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring Storage ACL operations count in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.

2. Run the following command to create a new bucket in the project:

   ```
   gsutil mb gs://<bucket-name>
   ```

3. Run the following command to enable logging for the bucket:

   ```
   gsutil logging set on -b gs://<bucket-name> gs://<log-bucket-name>/<log-object-prefix>
   ```

   Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket that you created in step 2, and `<log-bucket-name>` and `<log-object-prefix>` with the name of the bucket and object prefix where you want to store the logs.

4. Run the following command to create a new sink for the logs:

   ```
   gcloud logging sinks create <sink-name> storage.googleapis.com/<bucket-name> --include-children --log-filter='resource.type="gcs_bucket" protoPayload.methodName="storage.buckets.updateIamPolicy" protoPayload.resourceName="projects/_/buckets/<bucket-name>"'
   ```

   Replace `<sink-name>` with a name for the new sink, and `<bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket that you created in step 2.

5. Run the following command to grant the `logging.logWriter` role to the sink service account:

   ```
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <project-id> --member=serviceAccount:<sink-service-account> --role=roles/logging.logWriter
   ```

   Replace `<project-id>` with the ID of the project that contains the bucket, and `<sink-service-account>` with the email address of the service account that was created for the sink.

6. Verify that the sink is working correctly by updating the IAM policy for the bucket:

   ```
   gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://<bucket-name>
   ```

7. Check the logs in the log bucket to verify that the sink is working correctly:

   ```
   gsutil ls gs://<log-bucket-name>/<log-object-prefix>
   ```

   This should show a log entry for the IAM policy update that you performed in step 6.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring Storage ACL operations count in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Should Monitor Storage ACL Operations Count" for GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project where the storage bucket is located.

2. Go to the Cloud Storage section.

3. Find the bucket that needs to be monitored and click on it.

4. Click on the "Permissions" tab.

5. Click on the "Add Members" button.

6. Add the service account that will be used for monitoring. This service account must have the Cloud Monitoring Agent role.

7. Click on the "Add" button.

8. Open the Cloud Shell from the Google Cloud Console.

9. Install the Google Cloud Storage Python library by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install google-cloud-storage
   ```

10. Create a Python script that will monitor the ACL operations count for the storage bucket. Here's an example script:

   ```
   from google.cloud import monitoring_v3
   from google.oauth2 import service_account
   from google.cloud import storage

   # Set up credentials
   credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
       '<path-to-service-account-key>')

   # Set up the Monitoring client
   client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient(credentials=credentials)

   # Set up the Storage client
   storage_client = storage.Client(credentials=credentials)

   # Set up the metric descriptor
   project_name = '<project-name>'
   metric_type = 'storage.googleapis.com/storage/bucket/acl/operation_count'
   metric_descriptor = monitoring_v3.types.MetricDescriptor()
   metric_descriptor.type = metric_type
   metric_descriptor.metric_kind = (
       monitoring_v3.enums.MetricDescriptor.MetricKind.CUMULATIVE)
   metric_descriptor.value_type = (
       monitoring_v3.enums.MetricDescriptor.ValueType.INT64)
   metric_descriptor.description = 'The number of ACL operations on a Cloud Storage bucket.'
   metric_descriptor.unit = '1'
   client.create_metric_descriptor(
       name=client.project_path(project_name),
       metric_descriptor=metric_descriptor)

   # Set up the time series
   bucket_name = '<bucket-name>'
   time_series = monitoring_v3.types.TimeSeries()
   time_series.metric.type = metric_type
   time_series.resource.type = 'gcs_bucket'
   time_series.resource.labels['bucket_name'] = bucket_name
   time_series.resource.labels['project_id'] = project_name

   # Get the ACL operations count
   bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
   acl_operations_count = bucket.acl.user("allUsers").get()["operationCount"]

   # Set the data point
   point = monitoring_v3.types.Point()
   point.value.int64_value = acl_operations_count
   now = time.time()
   point.interval.end_time.seconds = int(now)
   point.interval.end_time.nanos = int(
       (now - point.interval.end_time.seconds) * 10**9)
   time_series.points.append(point)

   # Write the time series data
   client.create_time_series(
       name=client.project_path(project_name),
       time_series=[time_series])
   ```

   Replace the placeholders `<path-to-service-account-key>`, `<project-name>`, and `<bucket-name>` with the actual values.

11. Save the Python script and run it from the Cloud Shell by running the following command:

    ```
    python <script-name>.py
    ```

    Replace `<script-name>` with the actual name of the Python script.

12. Verify that the metric is being collected by going to the Cloud Monitoring section of the Google Cloud Console and checking that the metric is listed under the "Metrics Explorer" tab.
