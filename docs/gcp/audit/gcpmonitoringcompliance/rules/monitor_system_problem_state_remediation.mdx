### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console: Navigate to the GCP console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google account that has the necessary permissions to access the GCP resources.

2. Navigate to Monitoring: On the GCP console dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines on the top left corner), scroll down and click on "Monitoring" under the "Operations" section.

3. Check the Monitoring Dashboard: Once you are in the Monitoring section, you will see a dashboard with various metrics related to your GCP resources. Here, you can check the system problem state. Look for any unusual spikes or drops in the metrics, or any alerts that might indicate a problem.

4. Check Alerting Policies: Go to the "Alerting" section in the Monitoring menu. Here, you can see all the alerting policies that have been set up. Check if there is an alerting policy for monitoring system problem state. If there is, check its status and the conditions that trigger the alert. This will help you understand if the system problem state is being monitored properly.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate Google Cloud SDK: Google Cloud SDK includes the gcloud command-line tool that provides the primary CLI to Google Cloud Platform. You can download and install the Google Cloud SDK from the official Google Cloud SDK Documentation. After installation, you need to authenticate your Google Cloud account using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   This command will open a new browser window for you to log in to your Google Cloud account. After successful login, your default account and project will be set to your Google Cloud account and project.

2. List all the monitoring policies: You can list all the monitoring policies in your Google Cloud project using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud alpha monitoring policies list
   ```
   This command will list all the monitoring policies in your Google Cloud project. If the output is empty, it means there are no monitoring policies in your project.

3. Check the conditions of each policy: For each policy, you can check its conditions using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud alpha monitoring policies describe [POLICY_ID]
   ```
   Replace [POLICY_ID] with the ID of the policy you want to check. This command will display the details of the policy, including its conditions. If the conditions do not include "System Problem State", it means the policy does not monitor system problem state.

4. Check the notification channels of each policy: For each policy, you can also check its notification channels using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud alpha monitoring policies describe [POLICY_ID] --format="value(notificationChannels)"
   ```
   Replace [POLICY_ID] with the ID of the policy you want to check. This command will display the notification channels of the policy. If the output is empty, it means the policy does not have any notification channels, which means it cannot notify you when a system problem state occurs.

#### Using Python

To check if Cloud Monitoring is monitoring system problem state, you can use the Google Cloud Monitoring API with Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Set up Google Cloud SDK and Authentication:**
   Before you start, make sure you have installed Google Cloud SDK and authenticated your account. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
   This will open a new window in your web browser asking you to log in with your Google account and grant permissions.

2. **Install the Google Cloud Monitoring Python Client:**
   You can install the Google Cloud Monitoring Python client using pip:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-monitoring
   ```
   
3. **Import the Google Cloud Monitoring Client in Your Python Script:**
   In your Python script, import the Google Cloud Monitoring client:
   ```python
   from google.cloud import monitoring_v3
   ```
   
4. **Use the Google Cloud Monitoring Client to Check the System Problem State:**
   You can use the `list_time_series` method of the Google Cloud Monitoring client to check the system problem state. Here is an example:
   ```python
   client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient()
   project_name = client.project_path('your-project-id')

   interval = monitoring_v3.types.TimeInterval()
   now = time.time()
   interval.end_time.seconds = int(now)
   interval.end_time.nanos = int(
       (now - interval.end_time.seconds) * 10**9)
   interval.start_time.seconds = int(now - 3600)
   interval.start_time.nanos = interval.end_time.nanos

   results = client.list_time_series(
       project_name,
       'metric.type = "compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/utilization"',
       interval,
       monitoring_v3.enums.ListTimeSeriesRequest.TimeSeriesView.FULL)
   for result in results:
       print(result)
   ```
   This script will print the CPU utilization of all instances in your project for the last hour. If there are any instances with high CPU utilization, it could indicate a system problem.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

If the misconfiguration is related to monitoring system problem state in GCP, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate it using the GCP console:

1. Login to your GCP console and select the project where the misconfiguration exists.
2. Go to the "Monitoring" section from the left-hand menu.
3. Click on the "Uptime Checks" tab, which is located under the "Alerting" section.
4. Check if an uptime check is already created. If not, click on the "Create Uptime Check" button.
5. In the "Create Uptime Check" form, provide the necessary details such as the name of the uptime check, the resource type, and the resource to be monitored.
6. Select the protocol that should be used for monitoring (HTTP or HTTPS) and provide the URL to be monitored.
7. Configure the check frequency and the number of consecutive failures needed to trigger an alert.
8. Once all the details are provided, click on the "Create" button to create the uptime check.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration related to monitoring system problem state in GCP using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

The misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Should Monitor System Problem State" means that the monitoring system is not correctly configured to monitor the system problem state. To remediate this issue in GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud Monitoring page.

2. Click on the "Alerting" tab and then click on "Create Policy".

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Should Monitor System Problem State" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

2. Set up the credentials for the service account:

```
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path_to_service_account_file>')
```

3. Create a client for the Monitoring API:

```
client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient(credentials=credentials)
```

4. Define the resource for which you want to enable system monitoring:

```
resource_name = 'projects/<project_id>/instances/<instance_id>'
```

5. Define the metric descriptor for the system problem state:

```
metric_descriptor = monitoring_v3.types.MetricDescriptor()
metric_descriptor.type = 'agent.googleapis.com/system/problem_state'
metric_descriptor.metric_kind = monitoring_v3.enums.MetricDescriptor.MetricKind.GAUGE
metric_descriptor.value_type = monitoring_v3.enums.MetricDescriptor.ValueType.BOOL
metric_descriptor.description = 'The system problem state of the instance'
metric_descriptor.unit = '1'
```

6. Create the metric descriptor using the client:

```
client.create_metric_descriptor(parent='projects/<project_id>', metric_descriptor=metric_descriptor)
```

7. Verify that the metric descriptor has been created by listing all the metric descriptors:

```
for descriptor in client.list_metric_descriptors(parent='projects/<project_id>'):
    print(descriptor)
```

8. Enable the monitoring of the system problem state for the resource:

```
client.create_time_series(
    name=client.project_path('<project_id>'),
    time_series=[
        monitoring_v3.types.TimeSeries(
            metric=monitoring_v3.types.Metric(
                type='agent.googleapis.com/system/problem_state',
                labels={
                    'instance_id': '<instance_id>',
                    'zone': '<zone>'
                }
            ),
            resource=monitoring_v3.types.Resource(
                type='gce_instance',
                labels={
                    'project_id': '<project_id>',
                    'instance_id': '<instance_id>',
                    'zone': '<zone>'
                }
            ),
            points=[
                monitoring_v3.types.Point(
                    interval=monitoring_v3.types.TimeInterval(
                        end_time=timestamp_pb2.Timestamp.GetCurrentTime()
                    ),
                    value=monitoring_v3.types.TypedValue(
                        bool_value=True
                    )
                )
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

9. Verify that the monitoring is enabled by listing all the time series for the metric:

```
for series in client.list_time_series(
        name=client.project_path('<project_id>'),
        filter='metric.type="agent.googleapis.com/system/problem_state" AND resource.type="gce_instance" AND resource.labels.instance_id="<instance_id>"'
    ):
    print(series)
```

These steps will remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Should Monitor System Problem State" for GCP using Python.
