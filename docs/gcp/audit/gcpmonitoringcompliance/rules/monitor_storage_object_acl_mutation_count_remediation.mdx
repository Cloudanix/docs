### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console: Open your web browser and navigate to the GCP Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google Cloud credentials.

2. Navigate to Monitoring: From the GCP Console dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner). Scroll down and click on "Monitoring" under the "Operations" section.

3. Create or Edit a Dashboard: In the Monitoring page, you can either create a new dashboard or edit an existing one. To create a new dashboard, click on "Dashboard" and then "Create Dashboard". To edit an existing dashboard, click on the name of the dashboard you want to edit.

4. Add a Metric: Click on "Add Metric" to add a new metric to the dashboard. In the "Find resource type and metric" field, type "Storage Object Specific ACL Mutation Count" and select it from the dropdown list. Configure the metric as needed (e.g., set the "Aggregator" to "Count" and the "Alignment period" to the desired time frame). Click "Save" to add the metric to the dashboard.

Remember, this will only show you the count of ACL mutations. If you want to see the details of each mutation, you would need to check the logs in the "Logging" section of the GCP Console.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website. After downloading, you can install it by following the instructions provided. Once installed, you can initialize the SDK by running the command `gcloud init` and follow the prompts to authorize the SDK and set your default project, compute region and zone.

2. List all the metrics descriptors: You can list all the metrics descriptors available in your project by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    gcloud logging metrics list
    ```

3. Check for the specific metric: Now, you need to check for the specific metric "storage.googleapis.com/network/request_count". This metric counts the number of HTTP requests made to a bucket. You can do this by running the following command:

    ```
    gcloud logging read "resource.type=gcs_bucket AND metric.type=storage.googleapis.com/network/request_count"
    ```

4. Analyze the output: If the metric is being monitored, you will see the details of the metric in the output. If not, the metric is not being monitored. You can also use the `--format` flag to format the output in a more readable way. For example, you can use the following command to get the output in JSON format:

    ```
    gcloud logging read "resource.type=gcs_bucket AND metric.type=storage.googleapis.com/network/request_count" --format json
    ```
   
Remember, the above commands will only work if you have the necessary permissions to read the metrics. If you don't have the necessary permissions, you will need to ask your GCP administrator to grant you the necessary permissions.

#### Using Python

1. **Import Required Libraries**: The first step is to import the required libraries. We will need the `google.cloud` library for interacting with GCP services. If it's not installed, you can install it using pip: `pip install google-cloud-monitoring`. Here is the code to import the required libraries:

```python
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3
```

2. **Initialize the Client**: The next step is to initialize the client. We will use the `MetricServiceClient` class from the `google.cloud.monitoring_v3` module. This class provides methods to interact with the Monitoring API. Here is the code to initialize the client:

```python
client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient()
```

3. **Specify the Project ID and Metric ID**: The next step is to specify the project ID and the metric ID. The project ID is the ID of your GCP project. The metric ID is the ID of the metric that you want to check. In this case, it is `storage.googleapis.com/api/request_count`. This metric counts the number of API requests made to a specific storage object. Here is the code to specify the project ID and the metric ID:

```python
project_id = "your-project-id"
metric_id = "storage.googleapis.com/api/request_count"
```

4. **Check the Metric**: The final step is to check the metric. We will use the `list_time_series` method of the `MetricServiceClient` class. This method returns a list of time series that match a specified filter. The filter should specify the metric type and the storage object. Here is the code to check the metric:

```python
filter = f'metric.type = "{metric_id}" AND resource.type = "gcs_bucket" AND metric.label."bucket_name" = "your-bucket-name"'
interval = monitoring_v3.types.TimeInterval()
now = time.time()
interval.end_time.seconds = int(now)
interval.start_time.seconds = int(now - 3600)
results = client.list_time_series(
    client.project_path(project_id),
    filter,
    interval,
    monitoring_v3.enums.ListTimeSeriesRequest.TimeSeriesView.FULL)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This script will print the time series data for the specified metric and storage object. If the count of ACL mutations is high, it may indicate a misconfiguration.

```

4. Run the following command to create a metric descriptor for tracking ACL mutations:

```
gcloud beta monitoring metric-descriptors create \
--type=custom.googleapis.com/storage/object/iam_mutation_count \
--description="Count of mutations to a storage object's IAM policy" \
--metric-kind=DELTA \
--value-type=INT64 \
--display-name="Storage Object IAM Mutation Count"
```

5. Run the following command to create a log-based metric for tracking ACL mutations:

```
gcloud beta logging metrics create storage-object-iam-mutation-count \
--description="Count of mutations to a storage object's IAM policy" \
--log-filter='resource.type="gcs_bucket" AND protoPayload.methodName="storage.objects.update" AND protoPayload.request.updateMask.fieldPaths:"acl"' \
--metric-descriptors=custom.googleapis.com/storage/object/iam_mutation_count
```

6. Run the following command to create an alert policy for monitoring the log-based metric:

```
gcloud alpha monitoring policies create \
--display-name="Storage Object IAM Mutation Count Alert" \
--condition-exit-code=0 \
--condition-filter='metric.type="logging.googleapis.com/user/storage-object-iam-mutation-count" AND metric.label."bucket_name"="my-bucket"' \
--notification-channels=CHANNEL_ID \
--combiner=OR \
--duration=300s \
--comparison=COMPARISON_GT \
--threshold-value=1
```

Note: Replace "my-bucket" with the name of the storage bucket you want to monitor and replace "CHANNEL_ID" with the ID of the notification channel you want to use.

7. Verify that the alert policy is created successfully by running the following command:

```
gcloud alpha monitoring policies list
```

Now, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Should Monitor Storage Object Specific ACL Mutation Count" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring the storage object-specific ACL mutation count in GCP, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. Install the required libraries: 

```
pip install google-cloud-storage
pip install google-auth
```

2. Create a service account and download the JSON key file.

3. Set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the path of the JSON key file.

4. Use the following Python code to get the list of all buckets in your GCP project:

```
from google.cloud import storage

client = storage.Client()
buckets = client.list_buckets()

for bucket in buckets:
    print(bucket.name)
```

5. Use the following Python code to get the list of all objects in a bucket:

```
from google.cloud import storage

client = storage.Client()
bucket = client.get_bucket('bucket-name')
blobs = bucket.list_blobs()

for blob in blobs:
    print(blob.name)
```

6. Use the following Python code to get the ACL of a storage object:

```
from google.cloud import storage

client = storage.Client()
bucket = client.get_bucket('bucket-name')
blob = bucket.get_blob('object-name')
acl = blob.acl

for entry in acl:
    print(entry)
```

7. Use the following Python code to update the ACL of a storage object:

```
from google.cloud import storage

client = storage.Client()
bucket = client.get_bucket('bucket-name')
blob = bucket.get_blob('object-name')
acl = blob.acl

# Add a new entry to the ACL
entry = storage.acl.Entity('user-email', 'user')
acl.add_entity(entry)
acl.save()
```

8. Finally, you can use the above Python code snippets to monitor the storage object-specific ACL mutation count and take appropriate actions if the count exceeds a certain threshold.

Note: It is important to ensure that the service account used has sufficient permissions to access the required resources.
