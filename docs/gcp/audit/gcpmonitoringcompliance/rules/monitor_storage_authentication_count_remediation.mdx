### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console: Navigate to the GCP console by entering "https://console.cloud.google.com/" in your web browser. Use your GCP account credentials to log in.

2. Navigate to Monitoring: Once you are logged in, look for the "Navigation Menu" (hamburger icon) on the top left corner of the console. Click on it and scroll down to find the "Monitoring" option under the "Operations" section. Click on it to open the Monitoring dashboard.

3. Check for Storage Authentication Counts: In the Monitoring dashboard, look for the "Metrics Explorer" option on the left-hand side menu. Click on it and you will be redirected to the Metrics Explorer page. Here, you can search for the metric "Storage Authentication Counts" in the "Find resource type and metric" search bar. 

4. Verify the Monitoring: Once you have selected the "Storage Authentication Counts" metric, you will see a graph displaying the count of storage authentication requests over time. This graph should be monitored regularly to detect any unusual spikes or drops, which could indicate a misconfiguration or security issue.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate Google Cloud SDK: Google Cloud SDK includes the gcloud command-line tool that provides the primary CLI to Google Cloud Platform. You can download and install the Google Cloud SDK from the official website. After installation, you need to authenticate your account using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   This command will open a new browser window for you to log in to your Google account. After successful login, your SDK will be authenticated.

2. Set your project ID: You need to set your project ID to the project you want to monitor. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
   ```
   Replace [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your actual project ID.

3. List all the metrics: You can list all the metrics in your project using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud beta monitoring metrics list
   ```
   This command will list all the metrics in your project. You should look for the "storage.googleapis.com/network/authenticated_requests_count" metric in the list. This metric represents the count of authenticated requests to your storage.

4. Check the metric data: You can check the data of the "storage.googleapis.com/network/authenticated_requests_count" metric using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud beta monitoring timeseries list --filter 'metric.type="storage.googleapis.com/network/authenticated_requests_count"'
   ```
   This command will list the time series data of the authenticated requests count to your storage. If the count is unusually high, it may indicate a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. **Import Required Libraries**: The first step is to import the required libraries. For this task, we will need the `google.cloud` library. If it's not installed, you can install it using pip: `pip install google-cloud-monitoring`.

```python
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3
```

2. **Initialize the Client**: The next step is to initialize the client. You will need to authenticate with your GCP account. You can do this by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key file.

```python
client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient()
project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
```

3. **Create the Query**: Now, we need to create the query to get the metrics. We will use the `list_time_series` method of the client. We need to specify the project name, the filter, and the interval. The filter should be set to `'metric.type = "storage.googleapis.com/network/sent_bytes_count"'` to get the storage authentication counts.

```python
interval = monitoring_v3.types.TimeInterval()
now = time.time()
interval.end_time.seconds = int(now)
interval.start_time.seconds = int(now - 3600)
results = client.list_time_series(
    project_name,
    'metric.type = "storage.googleapis.com/network/sent_bytes_count"',
    interval,
    monitoring_v3.enums.ListTimeSeriesRequest.TimeSeriesView.FULL)
```

4. **Analyze the Results**: Finally, we need to analyze the results. We can iterate over the results and print them to the console. If the count is higher than expected, it may indicate a misconfiguration.

```python
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This script will print the storage authentication counts for the last hour. If the count is higher than expected, it may indicate a misconfiguration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Should Monitor Storage Authentication Counts" for GCP using GCP console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud Storage page.
2. Select the bucket that you want to monitor and click on the "Edit bucket details" button.
3. In the "Edit bucket details" page, scroll down to the "Access control" section.
4. Under the "Access control" section, you will see a list of all the users and groups that have access to the bucket.
5. Click on the "Add members" button to add new members to the bucket.
6. In the "Add members" dialog box, enter the email address of the user or group that you want to add to the bucket.
7. Select the appropriate role for the user or group from the dropdown menu. For example, you can select "Storage Object Viewer" or "Storage Object Creator" depending on the level of access you want to grant.
8. Click on the "Add" button to add the user or group to the bucket.
9. Repeat steps 6-8 for all the users and groups that need access to the bucket.
10. Once you have added all the necessary users and groups, click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

By following the above steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Should Monitor Storage Authentication Counts" for GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Should Monitor Storage Authentication Counts" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to enable the Cloud Storage API:

```
gcloud services enable storage-api.googleapis.com
```

3. Run the following command to create a Pub/Sub topic to store the audit logs:

```
gcloud pubsub topics create [TOPIC_NAME]
```

4. Run the following command to grant the Cloud Storage service account permission to publish messages to the Pub/Sub topic:

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member="serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]" --role="roles/pubsub.publisher"
```

Note: Replace [TOPIC_NAME], [PROJECT_ID], and [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] with the appropriate values.

5. Run the following command to create a sink to export Cloud Storage audit logs to the Pub/Sub topic:

```
gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_NAME] --log-filter='resource.type="gcs_bucket" AND protoPayload.methodName="storage.objects.create" AND protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail!="service-[PROJECT_NUMBER]@gcp-sa-logging.iam.gserviceaccount.com"'
```

Note: Replace [SINK_NAME], [PROJECT_ID], and [TOPIC_NAME] with the appropriate values.

6. Run the following command to update the Cloud Storage bucket to export audit logs to the sink:

```
gsutil logging set on -b gs://[BUCKET_NAME] -o [SINK_NAME]
```

Note: Replace [BUCKET_NAME] and [SINK_NAME] with the appropriate values.

7. Verify that the sink is exporting audit logs to the Pub/Sub topic by checking the topic subscription:

```
gcloud pubsub subscriptions describe projects/[PROJECT_ID]/subscriptions/[SUBSCRIPTION_NAME]
```

Note: Replace [PROJECT_ID] and [SUBSCRIPTION_NAME] with the appropriate values.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Should Monitor Storage Authentication Counts" for GCP using GCP CLI.
