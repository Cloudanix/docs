### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring system problem count in GCP using GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Monitoring section.

2. In the Monitoring section, select the Metrics Explorer from the left-hand menu.

3. In the Metrics Explorer, select the resource type for which you want to monitor system problem count. For example, if you want to monitor system problem count for a GCE instance, select "GCE VM Instance" as the resource type.

4. In the Metric field, type "system/problem_count" and select it from the dropdown list. This will show the system problem count metric for the selected resource type.

5. Set the time range for which you want to monitor the system problem count. You can select a predefined time range or set a custom time range.

6. Click on the "Create chart" button to create a chart for the system problem count metric.

7. You can set up alerting policies to get notified when the system problem count exceeds a certain threshold. To set up alerting policies, click on the "Create alerting policy" button and follow the prompts.

8. Once the alerting policy is set up, you will receive notifications when the system problem count exceeds the threshold.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not monitoring system problem count in GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

The "Cloud Monitoring Should Monitor System Problem Count" misconfiguration in GCP means that the system problem count metric is not being monitored in Cloud Monitoring. To remediate this issue, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud Monitoring page.

2. In the left-hand menu, select "Metrics Explorer".

3. In the "Find resource type and metric" search bar, type "system problem count".

4. Select the "System problem count" metric from the dropdown list.

5. In the "Find resource" search bar, select the resource you want to monitor (for example, a Compute Engine instance).

6. Under the "Chart Options" section, select the time range and chart type you want to use.

7. Click the "Add to Dashboard" button to add the chart to a dashboard.

8. If you want to receive alerts when the system problem count metric exceeds a certain threshold, you can create an alert policy by following these steps:

   a. In the left-hand menu, select "Alerting".

   b. Click the "Create Policy" button.

   c. In the "Add Condition" section, select "Metric Threshold" as the condition type.

   d. Select the "System problem count" metric and the resource you want to monitor.

   e. Set the threshold value and duration for the condition.

   f. In the "Notification Channels" section, select the channels you want to receive alerts on (for example, email or SMS).

   g. Click the "Save" button to create the alert policy.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Cloud Monitoring Should Monitor System Problem Count" misconfiguration in GCP using the GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of not monitoring system problem count in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to set up a monitoring workspace in GCP. To do this, go to the GCP console and navigate to "Monitoring" under "Operations". Click on "Create Workspace" and follow the prompts to set up your workspace.

2. Once your workspace is set up, you need to create a new monitoring policy that will monitor the system problem count. To do this, navigate to "Alerting" under "Monitoring" and click on "Create Policy". 

3. Give your policy a name and description, and then click on "Add Condition". 

4. In the "Target" section, select the GCP resource that you want to monitor. 

5. In the "Configuration" section, select "Metric Threshold" as the condition type. 

6. In the "Metric" section, select "System Problem Count" as the metric, and set the threshold value to the desired number of problems. 

7. In the "Notification" section, select the notification channels that you want to receive alerts on. 

8. Click on "Save" to create your monitoring policy. 

9. Finally, you need to set up a Python script to periodically check the system problem count and send alerts if the count exceeds the threshold. You can use the GCP Monitoring API to retrieve the system problem count and the Google Cloud Pub/Sub API to send alerts to the selected notification channels. 

10. You can use the following code as a starting point for your Python script:

```python
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

project_id = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
topic_name = "YOUR_TOPIC_NAME"
subscription_name = "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME"
threshold_value = 10

client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient()
project_name = client.project_path(project_id)

query = f'resource.type="gce_instance" AND metric.type="agent.googleapis.com/system/problem_count"'

response = client.list_time_series(
    request={
        "name": project_name,
        "filter": query,
        "interval": {
            "start_time": {"seconds": int(time.time() - 3600)},
            "end_time": {"seconds": int(time.time())},
        },
        "view": monitoring_v3.ListTimeSeriesRequest.TimeSeriesView.FULL,
    }
)

count = response[0].points[-1].value.double_value

if count > threshold_value:
    publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
    topic_path = publisher.topic_path(project_id, topic_name)
    message = f"System problem count is {count}, which exceeds the threshold of {threshold_value}."
    data = message.encode("utf-8")
    publisher.publish(topic_path, data=data)
```

This code retrieves the system problem count for all GCE instances in the specified project and sends an alert message to the specified Pub/Sub topic if the count exceeds the threshold value. You can run this script periodically using a cron job or a similar scheduling mechanism.
