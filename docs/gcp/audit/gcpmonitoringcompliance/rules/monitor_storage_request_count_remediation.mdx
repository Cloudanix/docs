### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console: Navigate to the GCP console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google account that has the necessary permissions to access the GCP resources.

2. Navigate to Monitoring: From the GCP console dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines on the top left corner), scroll down and click on "Monitoring" under the "Operations" section.

3. Check the Monitoring Dashboard: Once you are in the Monitoring section, you will see a dashboard with various metrics related to your GCP resources. Look for the "Storage" section. If Cloud Monitoring is monitoring storage request counts, you should see a graph or chart displaying the number of storage requests over time.

4. Check the Metrics: If you can't find the information on the dashboard, you can manually check the metrics. Click on "Metrics Explorer" on the left-hand side menu. In the "Find resource type and metric" field, type "Storage" and select the "Storage Request Counts" metric. If this metric is being monitored, you will see the data related to it. If not, it means that Cloud Monitoring is not monitoring storage request counts.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website. After installation, authenticate your account using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. List all the metrics descriptors: Use the following command to list all the metrics descriptors available in your project. Replace `my-project-id` with your actual project ID.

   ```
   gcloud logging metrics list --project=my-project-id
   ```

3. Check for the specific metric: Now, you need to check if the `storage.googleapis.com/network/request_count` metric is being monitored. This metric counts the number of HTTP requests made to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Use the following command:

   ```
   gcloud logging metrics describe storage.googleapis.com/network/request_count --project=my-project-id
   ```

4. Analyze the output: If the metric is being monitored, the command will return information about it, including its name, description, and filter. If the metric is not being monitored, the command will return an error message.

#### Using Python

To check if Cloud Monitoring is monitoring storage request counts, you can use the Google Cloud Monitoring API with Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Set up Google Cloud SDK and Python Environment:**
   First, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK and set up your Python environment. You can do this by following the instructions provided by Google Cloud. Make sure to authenticate your SDK with your GCP account.

2. **Install Required Python Libraries:**
   You need to install the `google-cloud-monitoring` library. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-monitoring
   ```
3. **Create a Python Script:**
   Create a Python script that uses the Google Cloud Monitoring API to list all the metrics descriptors. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import monitoring_v3

   def list_metric_descriptors(project_id):
       client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient()
       project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
       metrics = client.list_metric_descriptors(name=project_name)
       for metric in metrics:
           print(metric.type)

   list_metric_descriptors("your_project_id")
   ```
   Replace "your_project_id" with your actual project ID.

4. **Check for Storage Request Counts Metric:**
   Run the script and check the output for the `storage.googleapis.com/network/request_count` metric. If this metric is present, it means that Cloud Monitoring is monitoring storage request counts.

Remember, this script only checks if the metric descriptor for storage request counts exists. It doesn't check if any time series data is being collected for this metric. To do that, you would need to use the `list_time_series` method of the `MetricServiceClient` class.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate this misconfiguration in GCP using the GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Go to the GCP console and select the project where the storage bucket is located.

2. Click on the "Storage" option from the left-hand menu.

3. Select the bucket that you want to monitor and click on the "Edit bucket details" button.

4. Scroll down to the "Advanced settings" section and click on the "Logging" tab.

5. Click on the "Configure logs" button.

6. In the "Log sinks" section, click on the "Add sink" button.

7. In the "Create sink" dialog box, give a name to the sink and select the "Cloud Storage bucket" option.

8. Select the destination bucket where you want to store the logs.

9. In the "Filter" section, add the following filter:

```
protoPayload.serviceName="storage.googleapis.com"
protoPayload.methodName="storage.objects.insert"
```

This filter will monitor the storage request counts for the selected bucket.

10. Click on the "Create" button to create the sink.

11. Go back to the bucket details page and click on the "Notifications" tab.

12. Click on the "Add notification" button.

13. Select the "Cloud Pub/Sub" option and create a new topic.

14. Select the topic and set the desired notification settings.

15. Click on the "Save" button to save the notification settings.

Now, the GCP console will monitor the storage request counts for the selected bucket and send notifications to the configured topic if any threshold is breached.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and go to the Cloud Shell.

2. Run the following command to enable the Cloud Monitoring API:

```
gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com
```

3. Create a custom metric to monitor the storage request counts by running the following command:

```
gcloud monitoring metrics create storage/request_count --description "Number of storage requests" --display-name "Storage Request Count" --metric-kind "DELTA" --value-type "INT64" --unit "1"
```

4. Create a new uptime check to monitor the storage request counts by running the following command:

```
gcloud alpha monitoring uptime-checks create http storage-request-count --display-name "Storage Request Count" --check-type "HTTP" --http-method "GET" --path "/storage/request_count" --port "80" --use-ssl --project [PROJECT_ID]
```

5. Verify that the uptime check is created successfully by running the following command:

```
gcloud alpha monitoring uptime-checks list --project [PROJECT_ID]
```

6. If the uptime check is created successfully, you will see the following output:

```
NAME                CHECK_TYPE  PERIOD  TIMEOUT  GRACE_PERIOD  HTTP_CHECK
storage-request-count  HTTP        60s     10s       0s           GET http://[INSTANCE_IP_ADDRESS]/storage/request_count
```

7. Finally, you can view the storage request counts in the Cloud Monitoring console by navigating to the Metrics Explorer and selecting the custom metric that you created in step 3.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of monitoring storage request counts in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Should Monitor Storage Request Counts" for GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to enable the Cloud Storage API in your GCP project. To do this, go to the GCP Console and select your project. Then, click on "APIs & Services" in the left-hand menu and search for "Cloud Storage API". Click on "Enable" to enable the API.

2. Next, you need to install the necessary Python libraries to interact with the Cloud Storage API. You can use the `google-cloud-storage` library for this. Install it using pip by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install google-cloud-storage
   ```

3. Once you have installed the `google-cloud-storage` library, you can use it to monitor storage request counts in your GCP project. Here's some sample Python code that you can use to do this:

   ```
   from google.cloud import monitoring_v3
   from google.oauth2 import service_account
   import datetime
   
   # Set up authentication using a service account key file
   credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path-to-your-service-account-key-file>')
   
   # Set up the Monitoring client
   client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient(credentials=credentials)
   
   # Set up the query to get storage request counts
   project_name = '<your-project-name>'
   metric_type = 'storage.googleapis.com/storage/request_count'
   now = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
   minutes_ago = now - datetime.timedelta(minutes=5)
   interval = monitoring_v3.TimeInterval(
       {'end_time': now, 'start_time': minutes_ago})
   aggregation = monitoring_v3.Aggregation(
       {'alignment_period': {'seconds': 60}, 'per_series_aligner': 'ALIGN_SUM'})
   query = f'projects/{project_name}/metricDescriptors/{metric_type}'
   results = client.list_time_series(
       query,
       interval,
       monitoring_v3.ListTimeSeriesRequest.TimeSeriesView.HEADERS,
       aggregation=aggregation)
   
   # Print the results
   for result in results:
       print(result)
   ```

   This code will query the Cloud Monitoring API for storage request counts in the last 5 minutes, and print out the results.

4. Finally, you can set up a Cloud Monitoring alert to notify you if storage request counts exceed a certain threshold. To do this, go to the Cloud Monitoring Console and create a new alerting policy. Set the condition to trigger when storage request counts exceed your desired threshold, and set up notification channels to receive alerts.
