### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Monitoring: From the left-hand side menu, select "Monitoring" under the "Operations" section. This will take you to the Cloud Monitoring dashboard.

3. Check Notification Channels: In the Monitoring dashboard, click on "Notification Channels" under the "Alerting" section. This will display a list of all the notification channels configured in your GCP project.

4. Verify Notification Channel Status: For each notification channel listed, check the status. If the status is "Enabled", then the notification channel is correctly configured. If the status is "Disabled", then the notification channel is not enabled, indicating a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. This will allow you to interact with your GCP resources using the command line interface. You can download the SDK from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it.

2. Authenticate your SDK with GCP. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to log in with your Google account that has access to your GCP resources.

3. List all the notification channels in your GCP project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   gcloud alpha monitoring channels list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the notification channels in your project. If the list is empty, it means that no notification channels are enabled.

4. Check the status of each notification channel. You can do this by running the following command for each channel:
   ```
   gcloud alpha monitoring channels describe [CHANNEL_ID]
   ```
   Replace `[CHANNEL_ID]` with the ID of the notification channel you want to check. This command will return the details of the notification channel, including its status. If the status is 'DISABLED', it means that the notification channel is not enabled.

#### Using Python

To check if the Cloud Monitoring Notification Channel is enabled in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Python scripts, follow the steps below:

1. **Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Monitoring**:
   Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and the Python client for Monitoring. You can install the Python client for Monitoring using pip:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-monitoring
   ```

2. **Set up Authentication**:
   You need to authenticate your SDK to access the GCP services. You can do this by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable, which should point to the service account key JSON file.
   ```
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
   ```

3. **Python Script to List Notification Channels**:
   Use the following Python script to list all the notification channels in your GCP project. This script uses the Monitoring service client's `list_notification_channels` method to get all the notification channels.

   ```python
   from google.cloud import monitoring_v3

   def list_notification_channels(project_id):
       client = monitoring_v3.NotificationChannelServiceClient()
       project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"

       channels = client.list_notification_channels(name=project_name)

       for channel in channels:
           print(f"Notification Channel Name: {channel.display_name}")
           print(f"Notification Channel Enabled: {channel.enabled}")
           print("\n")

   # replace 'your-project-id' with your actual project id
   list_notification_channels('your-project-id')
   ```

4. **Check if Notification Channel is Enabled**:
   The script will print the name and the enabled status of each notification channel. If the enabled status is `False`, it means the notification channel is not enabled. If it's `True`, the notification channel is enabled.

Remember to replace `'your-project-id'` with your actual project id in the script.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Notification Channel Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Go to the GCP Console and select the project where the misconfiguration is present.
2. Click on the "Navigation menu" icon (three horizontal lines) in the top-left corner of the console and select "Monitoring".
3. In the Monitoring dashboard, click on the "Notification channels" tab on the left-hand side.
4. Click on the "Add notification channel" button at the top of the page.
5. Select the appropriate notification channel type (e.g. email, SMS, Slack, etc.) and follow the prompts to set up the channel.
6. Once the notification channel is set up, click on the "Alerting policies" tab on the left-hand side.
7. Click on the "Create policy" button at the top of the page.
8. Give the policy a name and description, and select the appropriate resource type and metric for the policy.
9. Under the "Conditions" section, set the conditions for the policy to trigger an alert (e.g. if CPU usage exceeds a certain threshold).
10. Under the "Notification channels" section, select the notification channel that was set up in step 5.
11. Click on the "Save" button to save the policy.

Once these steps are completed, the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Notification Channel Should Be Enabled" will be remediated for the GCP project.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Notification Channel Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, please follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the GCP console and go to the Cloud Monitoring page.

Step 2: Click on the "Notification channels" option from the left-hand side menu.

Step 3: Click on the "+ Create channel" button.

Step 4: Select the type of notification channel you want to create (Email, SMS, Slack, etc.) and follow the prompts to configure the channel.

Step 5: Once you have configured the notification channel, click on the "Test" button to ensure that the notification channel is working correctly.

Step 6: Once the test is successful, go back to the Cloud Monitoring page and click on the "Alerting policies" option from the left-hand side menu.

Step 7: Click on the alerting policy that you want to update.

Step 8: In the "Notifications" section, click on the "+ Add notification channel" button.

Step 9: Select the notification channel that you just created and click on the "Save" button.

Step 10: Repeat steps 8-9 for any other alerting policies that you want to update.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Notification Channel Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Monitoring Notification Channel Should Be Enabled" for GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```
   pip install google-cloud-monitoring google-auth
   ```

2. Authenticate to GCP using a service account key:
   ```
   from google.oauth2 import service_account

   credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
       '/path/to/service_account_key.json')
   ```

3. Create a notification channel:
   ```
   from google.cloud.monitoring_v3 import NotificationChannel
   from google.cloud.monitoring_v3 import NotificationChannelDescriptorServiceClient

   client = NotificationChannelDescriptorServiceClient(credentials=credentials)

   descriptor_name = client.notification_channel_descriptor_path(
       project_id, 'email')

   channel = NotificationChannel(
       type_='email',
       display_name='My email',
       labels={
           'email_address': 'example@example.com'
       }
   )

   client.create_notification_channel(
       project_id,
       channel,
       descriptor_name=descriptor_name
   )
   ```

4. Verify that the notification channel was created:
   ```
   from google.cloud.monitoring_v3 import NotificationChannelServiceClient

   client = NotificationChannelServiceClient(credentials=credentials)

   channels = client.list_notification_channels(project_id)

   for channel in channels:
       print(channel.display_name)
   ```

   This should output the display name of all notification channels in the project, including the one you just created.

   Note: Make sure to replace `project_id` and `example@example.com` with your own values.

With these steps, you should be able to remediate the "Cloud Monitoring Notification Channel Should Be Enabled" misconfiguration for GCP using Python.
