### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud Functions: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines) located at the top left corner of the page. Scroll down and click on "Cloud Functions" under the "COMPUTE" section.

3. Check Function Permissions: Once you are in the Cloud Functions page, click on the name of the function you want to inspect. This will open the function details page. Click on the "PERMISSIONS" tab to view the roles assigned to the function.

4. Inspect Roles: In the permissions tab, look for roles that have "admin" in their names. If any such roles are found, it means that the function has admin access, which is a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate the Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the Google Cloud CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and authenticate it with your Google Cloud account. You can download the SDK from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, you can authenticate it by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. List all the Cloud Functions: Once the SDK is installed and authenticated, you can list all the Cloud Functions in your project by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud functions list
   ```

3. Describe the Cloud Function: For each function listed, you can describe the function to get more details about it, including its access control settings. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud functions describe [FUNCTION_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[FUNCTION_NAME]` with the name of the function you want to describe.

4. Check the access control settings: In the output of the describe command, look for the `serviceAccountEmail` field. If this field is set to `PROJECT_ID@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`, it means the function is running with the App Engine default service account, which has the Editor role and therefore admin access. If the function needs to have limited access, this would be a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Cloud Functions: Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Cloud Functions on your local machine. You can install the Python client using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-functions
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the client:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import functions_v1
   client = functions_v1.CloudFunctionsServiceClient()
   ```

3. List all the Cloud Functions and their IAM policies: You can list all the Cloud Functions in your project and get their IAM policies using the `get_iam_policy` method. This method returns a `Policy` object that contains the bindings of the IAM policy.

   ```python
   parent = client.location_path('[PROJECT_ID]', '[LOCATION]')

   for function in client.list_functions(parent):
       policy = client.get_iam_policy(function.name)
       for binding in policy.bindings:
           print(f'Function: {function.name}, Role: {binding.role}, Members: {binding.members}')
   ```

   Replace '[PROJECT_ID]' and '[LOCATION]' with your project ID and location respectively.

4. Check for admin access: Now, you can check if any of the Cloud Functions have admin access by checking if any of the bindings have the role 'roles/cloudfunctions.admin'. If a function has this role, it means it has admin access.

   ```python
   for function in client.list_functions(parent):
       policy = client.get_iam_policy(function.name)
       for binding in policy.bindings:
           if 'roles/cloudfunctions.admin' in binding.role:
               print(f'Function {function.name} has admin access.')
   ```

   This script will print the names of all the Cloud Functions that have admin access.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration in GCP where a Cloud Function has admin access, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud Functions page.

2. Select the Cloud Function that has admin access.

3. Click on the "Edit" button on the top of the page.

4. Scroll down to the "Roles" section and click on the "Add Member" button.

5. In the "New Member" field, enter the email address of the service account that you want to use to run the Cloud Function.

6. In the "Role" field, select the "Cloud Functions Invoker" role from the drop-down menu.

7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

8. Verify that the service account has the "Cloud Functions Invoker" role by navigating to the "IAM & Admin" page and selecting the "IAM" tab.

9. Find the service account that you added and verify that it has the "Cloud Functions Invoker" role assigned to it.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration in GCP where a Cloud Function has admin access.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of a GCP Cloud Function having admin access, you can follow the below steps using GCP CLI:

1. Open the Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud Functions section.

2. Identify the Cloud Function that has admin access.

3. Determine the IAM policy bindings for the Cloud Function:

```
gcloud functions describe FUNCTION_NAME --format="value(iamPolicy)"
```

Replace FUNCTION_NAME with the name of your Cloud Function.

4. Review the IAM policy bindings to identify any roles with admin access.

5. Remove the admin role from the IAM policy bindings:

```
gcloud functions remove-iam-policy-binding FUNCTION_NAME \
    --member=MEMBER \
    --role=ROLE
```

Replace FUNCTION_NAME with the name of your Cloud Function, MEMBER with the email address of the user or service account that has admin access, and ROLE with the admin role (e.g., roles/cloudfunctions.admin).

6. Verify that the admin role has been removed from the IAM policy bindings:

```
gcloud functions describe FUNCTION_NAME --format="value(iamPolicy)"
```

7. Once the changes are saved, verify that the user or service account no longer has admin access by testing the function.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of a GCP Cloud Function having admin access using the GCP CLI, ensuring that the function has the appropriate access level to perform its intended function.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of a GCP Cloud Function having admin access, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Functions page in the GCP console.
2. Select the Cloud Function that has admin access.
3. Click on the "Edit" button to modify the function.
4. In the "Permissions" section, click on "Add Member".
5. Enter the email address of the user or service account that you want to grant access to the function.
6. In the "Role" dropdown menu, select a role that does not have admin access, such as "Cloud Functions Developer" or "Cloud Functions Viewer".
7. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

Here is an example Python script that can be used to remove admin access from a GCP Cloud Function:

```python
import google.auth
from google.cloud import functions_v1
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials

# Authenticate using the default credentials
creds, project_id = google.auth.default(scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"])
creds.refresh(Request())

# Initialize the Cloud Functions client
client = functions_v1.CloudFunctionsServiceClient(credentials=creds)

# Set the name of the Cloud Function that needs to be updated
function_name = "my-function"

# Get the current IAM policy for the function
resource = f"projects/{project_id}/locations/us-central1/functions/{function_name}"
policy = client.get_iam_policy(request={"resource": resource})

# Remove the "roles/cloudfunctions.admin" role from all members
for binding in policy.bindings:
    if binding.role == "roles/cloudfunctions.admin":
        binding.members.remove("allUsers")
        binding.members.remove("allAuthenticatedUsers")
        binding.members = [m for m in binding.members if not m.startswith("user:") and not m.startswith("serviceAccount:")]
        
# Update the IAM policy for the function
client.set_iam_policy(request={"resource": resource, "policy": policy})
```

This script uses the `google-cloud-functions` library to authenticate using the default credentials and update the IAM policy for the specified Cloud Function. It removes the "roles/cloudfunctions.admin" role from all members and updates the policy accordingly.
