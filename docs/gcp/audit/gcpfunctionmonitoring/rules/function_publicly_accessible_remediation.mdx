### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud Functions: From the left-hand side menu, select "Cloud Functions" under the "Compute" section. This will display a list of all the Cloud Functions that are currently deployed in your GCP project.

3. Check the Trigger column: For each Cloud Function, look at the "Trigger" column. If the trigger is set to "HTTP", this means that the function can be triggered by a HTTP request.

4. Check the Authentication requirement: Click on the name of the Cloud Function to open its details page. Under the "Trigger" tab, check the "Authentication" section. If it is set to "Allow unauthenticated invocations", this means that the Cloud Function endpoint is publicly accessible.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by Google Cloud at https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install.

2. Once the SDK is installed and configured, open your terminal and use the following command to list all the Cloud Functions in your project:

   ```
   gcloud functions list
   ```

3. For each function listed, use the following command to describe the function and get its details:

   ```
   gcloud functions describe [FUNCTION_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[FUNCTION_NAME]` with the name of your function.

4. In the output of the describe command, look for the `httpsTrigger` field. If the `httpsTrigger` field is present, it means that the function is publicly accessible. If the `httpsTrigger` field is not present, it means that the function is not publicly accessible.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: You will need the `google-auth`, `google-auth-httplib2`, `google-auth-oauthlib`, `google-api-python-client`, and `oauthlib` libraries. You can install these using pip:

```python
pip install --upgrade google-auth google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client oauthlib
```

2. Authenticate and create a service client: Before you can interact with GCP services, you need to authenticate your client. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient import discovery

# Load the credentials from the service account key file
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/keyfile.json')

# Build the service client
service = discovery.build('cloudfunctions', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

3. List all Cloud Functions: You can list all the Cloud Functions in a project by making a request to the `projects.locations.functions.list` method:

```python
# Replace 'my-project' with your project ID
response = service.projects().locations().functions().list(parent='projects/my-project/locations/-').execute()

# Print the names of all functions
for function in response['functions']:
    print(function['name'])
```

4. Check the IAM policy for each function: For each function, you can get the IAM policy and check if the `allUsers` or `allAuthenticatedUsers` members have the `cloudfunctions.invoker` role. If they do, the function is publicly accessible:

```python
for function in response['functions']:
    policy = service.projects().locations().functions().getIamPolicy(resource=function['name']).execute()

    for binding in policy['bindings']:
        if 'cloudfunctions.invoker' in binding['role']:
            for member in binding['members']:
                if member in ['allUsers', 'allAuthenticatedUsers']:
                    print(f"Function {function['name']} is publicly accessible")
```

This script will print the names of all publicly accessible Cloud Functions in your project.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the "Cloud Functions Endpoint Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" misconfiguration for GCP using the GCP console:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project that contains the Cloud Function you want to remediate.

2. In the navigation menu, go to "Cloud Functions" under the "Compute" section.

3. Select the Cloud Function that you want to remediate.

4. Click on the "Permissions" tab in the Cloud Function details page.

5. Under the "Ingress settings" section, click on the "Allow internal traffic only" radio button.

6. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

7. Verify that the Cloud Function is no longer publicly accessible by attempting to access the function's endpoint URL from a browser or using a tool like `curl`. You should receive an error message stating that access is denied.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the "Cloud Functions Endpoint Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" misconfiguration for GCP using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the issue of Cloud Functions Endpoint being publicly accessible in GCP, you can follow the below steps using GCP CLI:

1. Open the Cloud Functions page in the GCP console.
2. Find the function that you want to remediate and click on it.
3. In the function details page, click on the "Permissions" tab.
4. Under the "Invokers" section, click on "Add Member".
5. In the "Add members" dialog box, enter the email address of the service account or user that needs to access the function.
6. Select the appropriate role for the user/service account.
7. Click on "Save" to add the user/service account to the function's invokers list.
8. Repeat steps 4-7 for all the users/service accounts that need access to the function.

By following the above steps, you can restrict the access to your Cloud Functions Endpoint and ensure that it is not publicly accessible.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of Cloud Functions Endpoint being publicly accessible on GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Functions Console in your GCP project.
2. Select the function that you want to remediate and click on the "Edit" button.
3. In the "Edit Function" screen, scroll down to the "Networking" section and click on "Add VPC connector".
4. In the "Add VPC connector" screen, select the VPC network that you want to use and click on "Save".
5. Once the VPC connector is added, scroll down to the "Ingress Settings" section and select "Allow internal traffic only".
6. Click on "Save" to save the changes.

Now, your Cloud Functions Endpoint will not be publicly accessible and can only be accessed internally within the VPC network that you have specified. 

To automate this process using Python, you can use the GCP Python client library. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
from google.cloud import functions_v1

# Replace with your project ID
project_id = "your-project-id"

# Replace with the name of the Cloud Function that you want to remediate
function_name = "your-function-name"

# Initialize the Cloud Functions API client
client = functions_v1.CloudFunctionsServiceClient()

# Get the current configuration of the Cloud Function
function = client.get_function(name=f"projects/{project_id}/locations/us-central1/functions/{function_name}")

# Add the VPC connector to the Cloud Function
function.vpc_connector = "projects/{project_id}/locations/us-central1/connectors/{vpc-connector-name}"

# Set the ingress settings to "Allow internal traffic only"
function.ingress_settings = functions_v1.CloudFunction.IngressSettings.ALLOW_INTERNAL_ONLY

# Update the configuration of the Cloud Function
client.update_function(function=function, update_mask={"paths": ["vpc_connector", "ingress_settings"]})
```

Make sure to replace the `project_id`, `function_name`, and `vpc-connector-name` variables with the appropriate values for your environment.
