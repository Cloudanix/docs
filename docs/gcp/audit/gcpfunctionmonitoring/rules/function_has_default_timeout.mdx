Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Functions Should Have Default Timeout Configured" for GCP using GCP console:

1. Open the GCP Console and navigate to the Cloud Functions page.
2. Find the function that you want to remediate and click on its name.
3. In the left-hand menu, click on the "Edit" button.
4. Scroll down to the "Runtime, build, and connections settings" section.
5. Under the "General" tab, locate the "Timeout" field.
6. Set a default timeout value for your function. The recommended timeout value is 60 seconds.
7. Click on the "Save" button to save your changes.

That's it! You have now successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Cloud Functions Should Have Default Timeout Configured" for GCP using GCP console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Functions Should Have Default Timeout Configured" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP Cloud Shell or any terminal with GCP CLI installed.

2. Run the following command to set the default timeout for Cloud Functions:

   ```
   gcloud functions deploy FUNCTION_NAME --timeout TIMEOUT
   ```

   Replace `FUNCTION_NAME` with the name of the Cloud Function that you want to remediate and `TIMEOUT` with the desired timeout value in seconds. For example, to set the default timeout to 60 seconds for a Cloud Function named `my-function`, run the following command:

   ```
   gcloud functions deploy my-function --timeout 60s
   ```

3. After running the command, the Cloud Function will be redeployed with the default timeout set to the specified value.

4. Verify that the default timeout has been set by checking the Cloud Function's configuration using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud functions describe FUNCTION_NAME
   ```

   Replace `FUNCTION_NAME` with the name of the Cloud Function that you remediated. The output of the command will include the `timeout` field, which should match the value that you set in step 2.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Cloud Functions Should Have Default Timeout Configured" for GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Functions Should Have Default Timeout Configured" for GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Functions page in the GCP console.

2. Select the function that you want to configure.

3. In the function details page, click on the "Edit" button.

4. Scroll down to the "Advanced Options" section.

5. In the "Timeout" field, set the default timeout for your function. You can set the timeout value in seconds, up to a maximum of 540 seconds (9 minutes).

6. Click on the "Save" button to save your changes.

7. To automate this process for multiple functions, you can use the GCP Python SDK. Here's an example code snippet to set the default timeout for a Cloud Function using the Python SDK:

```python
from google.cloud import functions_v1

# Replace <function_name> with the name of your Cloud Function
function_name = "<function_name>"

# Replace <timeout_seconds> with the desired timeout value in seconds
timeout_seconds = 60

# Create a Cloud Functions client
client = functions_v1.CloudFunctionsServiceClient()

# Get the current function configuration
function = client.get_function(name=function_name)

# Update the function configuration with the new timeout value
function.timeout_seconds = timeout_seconds

# Update the function with the new configuration
update_mask = {"paths": ["timeout_seconds"]}
response = client.update_function(function=function, update_mask=update_mask)

print("Function timeout updated successfully.")
```

Note: Before running the above code, make sure that you have installed the `google-cloud-functions` Python package and authenticated with your GCP account using the `gcloud` CLI or a service account key file.
