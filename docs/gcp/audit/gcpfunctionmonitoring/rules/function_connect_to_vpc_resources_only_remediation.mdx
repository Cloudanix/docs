### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud Functions: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left corner), scroll down and click on "Cloud Functions" under the "COMPUTE" section.

3. Check Function Details: You will see a list of all your Cloud Functions. Click on the name of the function you want to inspect. This will open the function details page.

4. Check VPC Connector: In the function details page, look for the "VPC Connector" field under the "Connection" section. If the field is set to "No VPC Access" or is connected to a public VPC, then the function is not configured to connect to resources in a private VPC only.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK if you haven't done so already. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions provided.

2. Once the SDK is installed, open your terminal and authenticate your Google Cloud account by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to log in with your Google Cloud account.

3. Now, you can list all the Cloud Functions in your project by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud functions list
   ```
   This will return a list of all the Cloud Functions in your project, along with some basic information about each one.

4. To check if a specific Cloud Function is connected to a VPC, you can use the following command:
   ```
   gcloud functions describe [FUNCTION_NAME] --format='value(eventTrigger.failurePolicy.retry)'
   ```
   Replace `[FUNCTION_NAME]` with the name of the Cloud Function you want to check. If the function is connected to a VPC, the command will return `True`. If it's not, the command will return `False`.

Remember, this command only checks one function at a time. If you have multiple functions, you'll need to run this command for each one.

#### Using Python

1. Import the necessary libraries: You will need the `googleapiclient` library to interact with Google Cloud Platform (GCP). If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using pip: `pip install google-api-python-client`.

```python
from googleapiclient import discovery
from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError
```

2. Create a service object: This object will interact with the Cloud Functions API. You will need to specify the API name ('cloudfunctions'), the API version ('v1'), and your authentication method.

```python
service = discovery.build('cloudfunctions', 'v1')
```

3. List all Cloud Functions: Use the `projects().locations().functions().list()` method to get a list of all Cloud Functions in your project. Replace `'my-project'` and `'my-location'` with your project ID and location.

```python
request = service.projects().locations().functions().list(parent='projects/my-project/locations/my-location')
response = request.execute()
```

4. Check the VPC connection: For each function in the response, check the `vpcConnector` field. If this field is `None` or not present, the function is not connected to a VPC.

```python
for function in response['functions']:
    if 'vpcConnector' not in function or function['vpcConnector'] is None:
        print(f"Function {function['name']} is not connected to a VPC.")
```

This script will print the names of all Cloud Functions that are not connected to a VPC. If no functions are printed, all your functions are correctly configured to connect to a VPC.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud Functions Should Connect To Resources In VPC only" for GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project where the Cloud Function is located.
2. In the left-hand navigation menu, select "VPC Network" and then select "VPC networks".
3. Select the VPC network that you want to use for your Cloud Function.
4. In the "VPC Network Details" page, select "Add subnet".
5. In the "Create subnet" page, enter a name for the subnet and select the region where you want the subnet to be located.
6. Configure the subnet IP range and select the VPC network that you want to use for your Cloud Function.
7. Click "Create" to create the subnet.
8. In the left-hand navigation menu, select "Cloud Functions" and then select the Cloud Function that you want to configure.
9. In the "Cloud Function Details" page, click on the "Edit" button.
10. Scroll down to the "VPC connector" section and select the VPC connector that you created in step 6.
11. Click "Save" to save the changes.

After following these steps, your Cloud Function will be configured to connect to resources in the specified VPC only.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of allowing Cloud Functions to connect to resources outside of VPC on GCP, you can follow the below steps using the GCP CLI:

1. First, create a VPC network and subnet in your GCP project using the following command:

```
gcloud compute networks create [NETWORK_NAME] --subnet-mode custom
```

2. Next, create a subnet within the VPC network using the following command:

```
gcloud compute networks subnets create [SUBNET_NAME] --network [NETWORK_NAME] --region [REGION] --range [IP_RANGE]
```

Replace [SUBNET_NAME], [NETWORK_NAME], [REGION], and [IP_RANGE] with appropriate values.

3. Now, you need to deploy the Cloud Function within the VPC network by specifying the `--vpc-connector` flag with the `gcloud functions deploy` command. The `--vpc-connector` flag specifies the name of the Serverless VPC Access connector to use for the function. 

```
gcloud functions deploy [FUNCTION_NAME] --vpc-connector [CONNECTOR_NAME] --entry-point [ENTRY_POINT] --runtime [RUNTIME] --trigger-http
```

Replace [FUNCTION_NAME], [CONNECTOR_NAME], [ENTRY_POINT], and [RUNTIME] with appropriate values.

4. Finally, create a Serverless VPC Access connector using the following command:

```
gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create [CONNECTOR_NAME] --network [NETWORK_NAME] --region [REGION] --range [IP_RANGE]
```

Replace [CONNECTOR_NAME], [NETWORK_NAME], [REGION], and [IP_RANGE] with appropriate values.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of allowing Cloud Functions to connect to resources outside of VPC on GCP and ensure that all Cloud Functions are only able to connect to resources within the VPC network.

#### Using Python

To remediate this misconfiguration in GCP, you can follow the below steps using Python:

Step 1: Create a VPC connector
- First, create a VPC connector in the same region as your Cloud Function.
- You can create a VPC connector using the `google.cloud.functions.v1.VpcConnector` client library in Python.

```
from google.cloud.functions.v1 import VpcConnector
from google.cloud.functions_v1.types import VpcConnector

client = VpcConnector()
parent = "projects/<your-project-id>/locations/<your-region>"
connector = VpcConnector(display_name="<your-connector-name>", uri="<your-connector-uri>")
response = client.create_vpc_connector(parent=parent, connector=connector)
```

Step 2: Update the Cloud Function to use the VPC connector
- Next, update the Cloud Function to use the VPC connector you created in step 1.
- You can update the Cloud Function using the `google.cloud.functions.v1.CloudFunctionsServiceClient` client library in Python.

```
from google.cloud.functions.v1 import CloudFunctionsServiceClient
from google.cloud.functions_v1.types import CloudFunction

client = CloudFunctionsServiceClient()
function_name = "<your-function-name>"
function = client.get_cloud_function(name=function_name)
function.vpc_connector = "<your-connector-name>"
response = client.update_cloud_function(update_mask=field_mask, function=function)
```

Step 3: Test the updated Cloud Function
- Finally, test the updated Cloud Function to ensure that it can only connect to resources in the VPC.
- You can test the Cloud Function by invoking it and verifying that it can only access resources in the VPC.

Note: Make sure to replace the placeholders `<your-project-id>`, `<your-region>`, `<your-connector-name>`, `<your-connector-uri>`, and `<your-function-name>` with the appropriate values for your GCP environment.
