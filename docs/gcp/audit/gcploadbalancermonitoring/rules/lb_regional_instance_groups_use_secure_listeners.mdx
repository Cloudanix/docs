### More Info:

Load Balancers regional instance groups should use only the secure listeners. A listener is a process that checks for connection requests, using the protocol and port that you configure.

To remediate the "Load Balancers Regional Instance Groups Should Use Secure Listeners" misconfiguration for GCP using GCP console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to your GCP console.
2. Go to the "Navigation menu" and select "Network Services" and then "Load balancing".
3. Select the load balancer that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
5. In the "Backend configuration" section, you will see a list of backend services. Click on the backend service that you want to remediate.
6. In the "Backend service configuration" section, click on the "Edit" button.
7. In the "Frontend configuration" section, click on the "Add Frontend IP and Port" button.
8. Select "HTTPS" from the "Protocol" drop-down menu.
9. In the "IP" field, select the IP address that you want to use for the listener.
10. In the "Port" field, enter the port number that you want to use for the listener.
11. Click on the "Create" button.
12. In the "Backend service configuration" section, click on the "Update" button to save the changes.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancers Regional Instance Groups Should Use Secure Listeners" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell from the GCP console.

2. Run the following command to list all the regional instance groups:

```
gcloud compute instance-groups list
```

3. Identify the instance group that is associated with the load balancer that is not using the secure listener.

4. Run the following command to update the instance group to use a secure listener:

```
gcloud compute instance-groups set-named-ports [INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME] --named-ports=[PORT_NAME]:[PORT_NUMBER]/tcp --region=[REGION_NAME]
```

Replace the [INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME], [PORT_NAME], [PORT_NUMBER] and [REGION_NAME] with the actual values.

For example, if the instance group name is "my-instance-group", the port name is "https", the port number is "443" and the region is "us-central1", the command would be:

```
gcloud compute instance-groups set-named-ports my-instance-group --named-ports=https:443/tcp --region=us-central1
```

5. Verify that the instance group is updated by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute instance-groups list
```

The load balancer associated with the instance group should now be using a secure listener.

Note: Make sure to update the instance group name and region name as per your requirement.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancers Regional Instance Groups Should Use Secure Listeners" in GCP using python, follow the below steps:

1. Import necessary libraries:

```python
from googleapiclient import discovery
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials
```

2. Authenticate and create a client object:

```python
credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
compute = discovery.build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

3. Get the list of all regional instance groups:

```python
project = 'your-project-id'
zone = 'your-zone' # Example: us-central1-a
region = '-'.join(zone.split('-')[:-1])
instance_group_list = compute.instanceGroups().list(project=project, region=region).execute()
```

4. Iterate through the instance groups and check if they are associated with a load balancer and if so, check if they are using secure listeners:

```python
for instance_group in instance_group_list['items']:
    instance_group_name = instance_group['name']
    backend_service_list = compute.backendServices().list(project=project, filter=f'backendType=INSTANCE_GROUP&backendGroup={instance_group_name}').execute()
    if 'items' in backend_service_list:
        for backend_service in backend_service_list['items']:
            backend_service_name = backend_service['name']
            backend_service = compute.backendServices().get(project=project, backendService=backend_service_name).execute()
            if 'backends' in backend_service:
                for backend in backend_service['backends']:
                    if 'balancingMode' in backend and backend['balancingMode'] == 'UTILIZATION':
                        continue
                    instance_url = backend['group']
                    instance_group_name = instance_url.split('/')[-1]
                    instance_group = compute.instanceGroups().get(project=project, zone=zone, instanceGroup=instance_group_name).execute()
                    if 'namedPorts' in instance_group:
                        for named_port in instance_group['namedPorts']:
                            if named_port['name'] == 'http' or named_port['name'] == 'https':
                                if named_port['name'] == 'http':
                                    print(f'Instance group {instance_group_name} is associated with a load balancer and is using an unsecured listener. Please update the listener to use HTTPS.')
                                break
                    else:
                        print(f'Instance group {instance_group_name} is associated with a load balancer but no named ports were found.')
```

5. If an instance group is found to be using an unsecured listener, update the listener to use HTTPS:

```python
backend_service_name = 'your-backend-service-name'
backend_service = compute.backendServices().get(project=project, backendService=backend_service_name).execute()
if 'backends' in backend_service:
    for backend in backend_service['backends']:
        instance_url = backend['group']
        instance_group_name = instance_url.split('/')[-1]
        named_port = backend['name']
        compute.backendServices().update(project=project, backendService=backend_service_name, body={
            'name': backend_service_name,
            'backends': [{
                'group': instance_url,
                'balancingMode': 'UTILIZATION',
                'maxUtilization': 0.8
            }],
            'healthChecks': backend_service['healthChecks'],
            'protocol': 'HTTPS',
            'port': named_port
        }).execute()
        print(f'Listener for instance group {instance_group_name} has been updated to use HTTPS.')
```

Note: Replace "your-project-id" and "your-zone" with your actual project ID and zone. Also, replace "your-backend-service-name" with the name of the backend service that needs to be updated.
