### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console.

2. Navigate to the "Navigation Menu" on the top left corner of the console, then select "Network Services" and then "Load Balancing".

3. In the Load Balancing page, you will see a list of all your load balancers. Click on the name of the load balancer you want to check.

4. In the load balancer's details page, navigate to the "Frontend configuration" section. Here, you can see the SSL policy of the load balancer. If the Minimum TLS version is not set to 1.3, then the load balancer is not using the latest TLS version 1.3.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Authenticate your CLI with your Google Cloud account by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the instructions to log in with your Google account.

3. List all the load balancers in your project by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud compute target-ssl-proxies list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the SSL proxies (load balancers) in your project.

4. For each load balancer, check the SSL policy to see if it uses TLS 1.3. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud compute ssl-policies describe [SSL_POLICY]
   ```
   Replace `[SSL_POLICY]` with the name of the SSL policy used by the load balancer. This command will return the details of the SSL policy, including the minimum TLS version. If the minimum TLS version is not 1.3, then the load balancer is not using the latest TLS version.

#### Using Python

1. AWS:
   - Install boto3, the AWS SDK for Python, and configure your AWS credentials.
   - Use the `describe_load_balancers` function to get a list of all load balancers.
   - For each load balancer, use the `describe_load_balancer_attributes` function to get its attributes.
   - Check the `Policies` attribute for the TLS version. If it's not 1.3, the load balancer is misconfigured.

```python
import boto3

elb = boto3.client('elbv2')
load_balancers = elb.describe_load_balancers()

for lb in load_balancers['LoadBalancers']:
    attrs = elb.describe_load_balancer_attributes(LoadBalancerArn=lb['LoadBalancerArn'])
    for attr in attrs['Attributes']:
        if attr['Key'] == 'Policies' and 'TLS-1.3' not in attr['Value']:
            print(f"Load balancer {lb['LoadBalancerName']} is misconfigured.")
```

2. Azure:
   - Install the Azure SDK for Python and configure your Azure credentials.
   - Use the `network_client.load_balancers.list_all()` function to get a list of all load balancers.
   - For each load balancer, check the `ssl_policy` attribute for the TLS version. If it's not 1.3, the load balancer is misconfigured.

```python
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

load_balancers = network_client.load_balancers.list_all()

for lb in load_balancers:
    if lb.ssl_policy and lb.ssl_policy.min_protocol_version != 'TLSv1_3':
        print(f"Load balancer {lb.name} is misconfigured.")
```

3. GCP:
   - Install the Google Cloud SDK for Python and configure your GCP credentials.
   - Use the `compute.target_https_proxies().list()` function to get a list of all HTTPS proxies (which are used by load balancers).
   - For each proxy, check the `sslPolicy` attribute for the TLS version. If it's not 1.3, the load balancer is misconfigured.

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

compute = compute_v1.TargetHttpsProxiesClient()

proxies = compute.list(project='your-project-id')

for proxy in proxies:
    if proxy.ssl_policy and 'TLS_1_3' not in proxy.ssl_policy:
        print(f"Load balancer {proxy.name} is misconfigured.")
```

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration of using the latest TLS version 1.3 for Load Balancers on GCP using the GCP console:

1. Open the GCP Console and go to the Load Balancing page.
2. Select the Load Balancer for which you want to enable TLS 1.3.
3. Click on the Edit button to open the Edit load balancer page.
4. In the Edit load balancer page, scroll down to the Frontend configuration section and click on the Edit button next to the HTTPS protocol.
5. In the Edit frontend configuration page, scroll down to the Advanced configuration section.
6. In the Advanced configuration section, click on the Add item button to add a new item to the list.
7. In the new item, set the Name to "tls-version" and the Value to "TLS_1_3".
8. Click on the Save button to save the changes.
9. Click on the Update button in the Edit load balancer page to apply the changes to the Load Balancer.

That's it! The Load Balancer now uses the latest TLS version 1.3 for HTTPS protocol.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of Load Balancers not using the latest TLS version 1.3 on GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell on GCP Console, which is a command-line interface that can be used to run GCP CLI commands.

2. Run the following command to create a new SSL policy with TLS version 1.3 enabled:

```
gcloud compute ssl-policies create <ssl-policy-name> --profile=MODERN --min-tls-version=1.3
```

Replace `<ssl-policy-name>` with a name for your SSL policy.

3. Run the following command to update the SSL policy for your load balancer:

```
gcloud compute target-https-proxies update <target-https-proxy-name> --ssl-policy=<ssl-policy-name>
```

Replace `<target-https-proxy-name>` with the name of your target HTTPS proxy, and `<ssl-policy-name>` with the name of the SSL policy you created in step 2.

4. Finally, run the following command to verify that TLS version 1.3 is enabled for your load balancer:

```
gcloud compute ssl-policies describe <ssl-policy-name> --format="get(minTlsVersion)"
```

Replace `<ssl-policy-name>` with the name of the SSL policy you created in step 2. The output should show "TLS_1_3" as the minimum TLS version.

With these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of Load Balancers not using the latest TLS version 1.3 on GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of load balancers not using the latest TLS version 1.3 in GCP using Python, follow the below steps:

1. Install the latest version of the Google Cloud SDK by running the following command in the terminal:

```
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
```

2. Initialize the Google Cloud SDK by running the following command:

```
gcloud init
```

3. Create a new Python file and import the necessary libraries:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1
```

4. Set up the Google Cloud client:

```python
compute_client = compute_v1.ComputeClient()
```

5. Get the list of all load balancers in the project:

```python
project_id = 'your-project-id'
load_balancers = compute_client.forwarding_rules().list(project=project_id).execute()
```

6. Loop through the list of load balancers and update their SSL policy to use TLS version 1.3:

```python
for load_balancer in load_balancers['items']:
    forwarding_rule_name = load_balancer['name']
    forwarding_rule_region = load_balancer['region']
    ssl_policy_name = 'global/ssl-policies/TLS_1_3'

    # Get the current SSL policy of the load balancer
    forwarding_rule = compute_client.forwarding_rules().get(project=project_id, region=forwarding_rule_region, forwardingRule=forwarding_rule_name).execute()
    current_ssl_policy = forwarding_rule.get('sslPolicy')

    # Update the SSL policy to use TLS version 1.3
    if current_ssl_policy != ssl_policy_name:
        request_body = {
            'sslPolicy': ssl_policy_name
        }
        compute_client.forwarding_rules().setSslPolicy(project=project_id, region=forwarding_rule_region, forwardingRule=forwarding_rule_name, sslPolicyReference=request_body).execute()
```

7. Save the Python file and run it in the terminal:

```
python filename.py
```

This will update the SSL policy of all load balancers in the GCP project to use the latest TLS version 1.3.
