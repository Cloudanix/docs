### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Load Balancing: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner), scroll down and click on "Network Services", then select "Load balancing".

3. Select the Load Balancer: In the Load balancing page, you will see a list of your load balancers. Click on the name of the load balancer you want to inspect.

4. Check the Frontend Configuration: In the load balancer's details page, scroll down to the "Frontend configuration" section. Here, you can see the protocols accepted by the load balancer. If it's set to HTTP, then it's not accepting HTTPS connections. If it's set to HTTPS or HTTP/HTTPS, then it is accepting HTTPS connections.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK (Software Development Kit) if you haven't done so already. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, you can initialize it by running the command `gcloud init` and follow the prompts to authenticate your Google Cloud account.

2. Once the SDK is installed and initialized, you can list all the URL maps in your project by running the following command: `gcloud compute url-maps list`. This command will return a list of all URL maps, including their names and the fully qualified URL of each map.

3. To check the details of a specific URL map, you can use the following command: `gcloud compute url-maps describe [URL_MAP_NAME]`. Replace `[URL_MAP_NAME]` with the name of the URL map you want to inspect. This command will return a detailed description of the URL map, including the protocols it accepts.

4. To specifically check if the URL map accepts HTTPS connections, you need to look at the `defaultService` field in the output of the previous command. If the value of this field starts with `https://`, it means that the URL map accepts HTTPS connections. If it starts with `http://`, it means that the URL map only accepts HTTP connections.

#### Using Python

To check if Load Balancer Global Urlmaps accept HTTPS connections in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you can use the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) or the Google Cloud Client Libraries for Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Setup Google Cloud SDK and Authentication:**
   Before you can interact with GCP resources using Python, you need to authenticate your client. You can do this by setting up the Google Cloud SDK and then using the command `gcloud auth application-default login` to authenticate your client.

2. **Install Google Cloud Client Libraries for Python:**
   You can install the Google Cloud Client Libraries for Python using pip. The command is `pip install --upgrade google-cloud-compute`.

3. **Fetch the list of Global Urlmaps:**
   Use the Compute Engine client library to fetch the list of Global Urlmaps. Here is a sample Python script:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1

   def list_url_maps(project):
       client = compute_v1.UrlMapsClient()
       response = client.list(project=project)
       return response
   ```

4. **Check if Urlmaps accept HTTPS connections:**
   Iterate over the list of Urlmaps and check if they accept HTTPS connections. If the `defaultService` of a Urlmap is an HTTPS backend service, it accepts HTTPS connections. Here is a sample Python script:

   ```python
   def check_https_url_maps(url_maps):
       for url_map in url_maps:
           if 'https' in url_map.default_service:
               print(f"Urlmap {url_map.name} accepts HTTPS connections.")
           else:
               print(f"Urlmap {url_map.name} does not accept HTTPS connections.")
   ```

   Call these functions with your project ID:

   ```python
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   url_maps = list_url_maps(project_id)
   check_https_url_maps(url_maps)
   ```

This script will print out whether each Urlmap in your project accepts HTTPS connections or not.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Load Balancer Global Urlmaps should accept HTTPS connections in GCP, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to your GCP console and select the project where the misconfiguration exists.
2. Go to the Navigation menu and select Networking -> Network services -> Load balancing.
3. Select the Load balancer where the misconfiguration exists.
4. Click on the Edit button at the top of the page.
5. In the Edit Load Balancer page, scroll down to the Backend configuration section.
6. Click on the Backend services link.
7. Select the backend service where the misconfiguration exists.
8. In the Backend service page, scroll down to the Backend configuration section.
9. Click on the Edit button next to the backend configuration.
10. In the Edit backend configuration page, scroll down to the Protocol section.
11. Select the HTTPS option from the dropdown list.
12. Click on the Save button to save the changes.

Once the above steps are completed, the Load Balancer Global Urlmaps will accept HTTPS connections.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancer Global Urlmaps Should Accept Https Connections" in GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.
2. Run the following command to get the list of all the URL maps in the project:

   ```
   gcloud compute url-maps list
   ```

3. Identify the URL map that needs to be modified and note down its name.
4. Run the following command to update the URL map to accept HTTPS connections:

   ```
   gcloud compute url-maps update [URL_MAP_NAME] --default-service [SERVICE_NAME] --ssl-certificates [SSL_CERTIFICATE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace [URL_MAP_NAME] with the name of the URL map that needs to be modified, [SERVICE_NAME] with the name of the default service associated with the URL map, and [SSL_CERTIFICATE_NAME] with the name of the SSL certificate to be used for HTTPS connections.

5. After running the above command, the URL map will be updated to accept HTTPS connections. You can verify the changes by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute url-maps describe [URL_MAP_NAME]
   ```

   This command will display the updated configuration of the URL map.

Note: Before running the above commands, make sure you have the necessary permissions to modify the URL maps in the project.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Load Balancer Global Urlmaps not accepting HTTPS connections in GCP using Python, follow the steps below:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
from google.cloud import compute_v1
from google.protobuf.json_format import MessageToDict
```

2. Authenticate to the GCP project:

```
compute_client = compute_v1.ComputeClient()
project = "your-project-id"
```

3. Get the list of URL maps:

```
urlmaps = compute_client.url_maps().list(project=project).execute()
```

4. Loop through the URL maps and check if HTTPS is enabled:

```
for urlmap in urlmaps.get("items", []):
    urlmap_name = urlmap["name"]
    urlmap = compute_client.url_maps().get(project=project, urlMap=urlmap_name).execute()
    urlmap_dict = MessageToDict(urlmap, preserving_proto_field_name=True)
    if urlmap_dict.get("hostRules"):
        for host_rule in urlmap_dict["hostRules"]:
            if host_rule.get("pathMatcher"):
                path_matcher = host_rule["pathMatcher"]
                if path_matcher.get("defaultService"):
                    default_service = path_matcher["defaultService"]
                    if default_service.startswith("https://"):
                        print(f"HTTPS is enabled for URL map {urlmap_name}")
                    else:
                        print(f"HTTPS is not enabled for URL map {urlmap_name}")
                else:
                    print(f"No default service found for path matcher in URL map {urlmap_name}")
            else:
                print(f"No path matcher found for host rule in URL map {urlmap_name}")
    else:
        print(f"No host rules found in URL map {urlmap_name}")
```

5. If HTTPS is not enabled, update the URL map to accept HTTPS connections:

```
urlmap_name = "your-url-map-name"
urlmap = compute_client.url_maps().get(project=project, urlMap=urlmap_name).execute()
urlmap_dict = MessageToDict(urlmap, preserving_proto_field_name=True)
if urlmap_dict.get("hostRules"):
    for host_rule in urlmap_dict["hostRules"]:
        if host_rule.get("pathMatcher"):
            path_matcher = host_rule["pathMatcher"]
            if path_matcher.get("defaultService"):
                default_service = path_matcher["defaultService"]
                if default_service.startswith("http://"):
                    path_matcher["defaultService"] = default_service.replace("http://", "https://")
                    urlmap_body = {"hostRules": urlmap_dict["hostRules"]}
                    compute_client.url_maps().patch(project=project, urlMap=urlmap_name, body=urlmap_body).execute()
                    print(f"HTTPS enabled for URL map {urlmap_name}")
                else:
                    print(f"HTTPS already enabled for URL map {urlmap_name}")
            else:
                print(f"No default service found for path matcher in URL map {urlmap_name}")
        else:
            print(f"No path matcher found for host rule in URL map {urlmap_name}")
else:
    print(f"No host rules found in URL map {urlmap_name}")
```

Note: Replace "your-project-id" and "your-url-map-name" with the actual project ID and URL map name in the code. Also, make sure you have the necessary permissions to update the URL map.
