### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to Google Cloud Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google Cloud account.

2. Navigate to Load Balancing: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner). Scroll down and click on "Network Services", then select "Load balancing".

3. Check Backend Services: In the Load balancing page, click on the name of the load balancer you want to inspect. This will open the load balancer's details page. Click on the "Backend configuration" section to view the backend services.

4. Check for Secure Listeners: In the backend services details, look for the "Protocol" field. If the protocol is HTTP or TCP, it means the backend service is not using secure listeners. Secure listeners should be using HTTPS or SSL protocols.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Once the gcloud CLI is set up, you can list all the global backend services in your GCP project by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services list --global
   ```

   This command will return a list of all the global backend services in your project, including their names and other details.

3. To check if a specific global backend service is using secure listeners, you can describe it using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --global
   ```

   Replace `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of the backend service you want to check. This command will return a detailed description of the backend service, including the protocols it uses.

4. In the output of the previous command, look for the "protocol" field. If the value of this field is "HTTPS" or "SSL", it means that the backend service is using secure listeners. If the value is "HTTP" or "TCP", it means that the backend service is not using secure listeners.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK and the Python client library for Google Cloud. You can do this using pip:

   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-sdk
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud
   ```

2. Authenticate your SDK: You need to authenticate your Google Cloud SDK with your GCP account. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check the configuration of the Load Balancer: Here is a sample script that checks if the Load Balancer is using secure listeners:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1

   def check_load_balancer_security():
       client = compute_v1.BackendServicesClient()
       project = '[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]'
       for backend_service in client.list(project=project):
           for backend in backend_service.backends:
               if backend.protocol != 'HTTPS':
                   print(f"Backend service {backend_service.name} is not using secure listeners")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       check_load_balancer_security()
   ```

   Replace '[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]' with your actual project ID. This script will print the names of all backend services that are not using HTTPS.

4. Run the script: You can run the script using the Python interpreter:

   ```
   python check_load_balancer_security.py
   ```

   If there are any backend services that are not using secure listeners, their names will be printed to the console. If no names are printed, then all backend services are using secure listeners.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancers Global Backend Services Should Use Secure Listeners" for GCP using GCP console:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Load Balancing page.

2. Click on the name of the load balancer that you want to modify.

3. Click on the "Backend Services" tab.

4. Select the backend service that you want to modify.

5. Click on the "Edit" button.

6. Scroll down to the "Backend" section and click on the "Add Backend" button.

7. In the "New Backend" dialog box, enter the IP address or hostname of the backend server that you want to add.

8. Select the protocol that you want to use for the backend service. Make sure to choose a secure protocol such as HTTPS or SSL.

9. Enter the port number that the backend server is listening on.

10. Click on the "Create" button to add the new backend server to the backend service.

11. Repeat steps 6-10 for each backend server that you want to add.

12. Once you have added all the backend servers, click on the "Save" button to save the changes to the backend service.

13. Repeat steps 4-12 for each backend service that you want to modify.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancers Global Backend Services Should Use Secure Listeners" for GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancers Global Backend Services Should Use Secure Listeners" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.

2. Run the following command to list all the backend services in your project:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services list
   ```

3. Identify the backend service that is not using secure listeners.

4. Run the following command to update the backend service with a secure listener:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services update [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --global --protocol HTTPS --port-name https --timeout 30s
   ```

   Replace [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] with the name of the backend service that you identified in step 3.

5. Verify that the backend service has been updated with a secure listener by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]
   ```

   This command should display the details of the updated backend service, including the secure listener.

6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all the backend services in your project that are not using secure listeners.

7. Finally, verify that the misconfiguration has been remediated by running the appropriate scans or audits.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancers Global Backend Services Should Use Secure Listeners" for GCP using python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Import the necessary libraries:
```
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

Step 2: Set up the credentials:
```
creds = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path_to_service_account_key_file>')
project_id = '<your_project_id>'
```

Step 3: Create a function to get the list of backend services:
```
def get_backend_services(compute, project_id):
    result = compute.backendServices().list(project=project_id).execute()
    backend_services = result['items'] if 'items' in result else None
    return backend_services
```

Step 4: Create a function to update the backend services to use secure listeners:
```
def update_backend_service(compute, project_id, backend_service):
    backend_service_name = backend_service['name']
    backend_service_url_map = backend_service['backends'][0]['group']
    backend_service_port = backend_service['backends'][0]['balancingMode']['utilization']['defaultBackendService']
    backend_service_protocol = backend_service['protocol']
    if backend_service_protocol == 'HTTP':
        backend_service_protocol = 'HTTPS'
    else:
        return
    request_body = {
        'name': backend_service_name,
        'backends': [
            {
                'group': backend_service_url_map,
                'balancingMode': 'UTILIZATION',
                'maxUtilization': 0.8,
                'capacityScaler': 1,
                'failover': False,
                'port': backend_service_port
            }
        ],
        'protocol': backend_service_protocol,
        'timeoutSec': 30
    }
    compute.backendServices().update(project=project_id, backendService=backend_service_name, body=request_body).execute()
```

Step 5: Call the functions to update the backend services:
```
compute = build('compute', 'v1', credentials=creds)
backend_services = get_backend_services(compute, project_id)
for backend_service in backend_services:
    update_backend_service(compute, project_id, backend_service)
```

This will update all the backend services to use secure listeners in your GCP project.
