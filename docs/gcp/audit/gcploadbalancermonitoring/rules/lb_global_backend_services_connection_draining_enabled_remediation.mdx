### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to Google Cloud Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Load Balancing: From the main navigation menu, select "Networking" and then "Load balancing". This will take you to the Load balancing page where you can see all your load balancers.

3. Select the Load Balancer: From the list of load balancers, select the one you want to check for connection draining. Click on the name of the load balancer to open its details page.

4. Check Connection Draining: In the details page, look for the "Connection Draining Timeout" setting under the "Backend configuration" section. If the value is set to 0, it means connection draining is not enabled. If it's set to a value greater than 0, it indicates the number of seconds the load balancer will keep connections open to allow in-flight requests to complete before the backend instance is removed.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud SDK documentation. After installation, authenticate the SDK to your Google Cloud account using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. Set your project ID to the project you want to inspect. Replace 'your-project-id' with your actual project ID.

   ```
   gcloud config set project your-project-id
   ```

3. List all the global backend services in your project using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services list --global
   ```

4. For each backend service, check if connection draining is enabled. Replace 'backend-service-name' with the name of your backend service.

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services describe backend-service-name --global | grep connectionDraining
   ```

   If the 'connectionDraining' field is not present or if the 'drainingTimeoutSec' is set to 0, then connection draining is not enabled for that backend service.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK and the Python client library for Google Cloud. You can do this using pip:

   ```python
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-sdk
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud
   ```

2. Authenticate your SDK: Use the `gcloud auth application-default login` command to authenticate your SDK. This will open a new browser window where you can log in with your Google Cloud credentials.

3. Write a Python script to check the connection draining settings: You can use the Google Cloud Python client library to interact with your Load Balancer settings. Here's a basic script that checks if connection draining is enabled:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1

   def check_connection_draining(project_id, region, backend_service):
       client = compute_v1.BackendServicesClient()
       response = client.get(project=project_id, region=region, backend_service=backend_service)
       return response.connection_draining

   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   region = 'your-region'
   backend_service = 'your-backend-service'

   connection_draining = check_connection_draining(project_id, region, backend_service)
   if connection_draining:
       print("Connection draining is enabled.")
   else:
       print("Connection draining is not enabled.")
   ```

4. Run the script: You can run the script using the Python interpreter. If connection draining is enabled, it will print "Connection draining is enabled." If it's not, it will print "Connection draining is not enabled."

Please replace 'your-project-id', 'your-region', and 'your-backend-service' with your actual project ID, region, and backend service name.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Load Balancers not having connection draining enabled in Global Backend Services in GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the GCP console and navigate to the Load Balancing page.

2. Select the Load Balancer that needs to be remediated.

3. Click on the Edit button to edit the Load Balancer configuration.

4. Scroll down to the Backend section and click on the Edit button next to the Global Backend Service.

5. In the Global Backend Service configuration, scroll down to the Connection Draining section.

6. Enable Connection Draining by checking the box next to it.

7. Set the Drain Timeout to the desired value (in seconds) for the load balancer to wait before terminating connections.

8. Click on the Save button to save the changes.

9. Once the changes are saved, verify that the Load Balancer now has Connection Draining enabled for Global Backend Services.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Load Balancers not having connection draining enabled in Global Backend Services in GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancers Should Have Connection Draining Enabled In Global Backend Services" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.
2. Run the following command to list all the global backend services in your project:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services list --global
   ```

3. Identify the backend service that is associated with the load balancer that needs to be updated. Note down the name of the backend service.
4. Run the following command to enable connection draining for the identified backend service:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services update [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --connection-draining-timeout [TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS] --global
   ```

   Replace [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] with the name of the backend service identified in step 3 and [TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS] with the time in seconds that you want to wait for existing connections to drain before terminating them. For example:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services update my-backend-service --connection-draining-timeout 300 --global
   ```

   This command sets the connection draining timeout to 300 seconds (5 minutes).
   
5. Verify that connection draining is enabled for the backend service by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --global | grep "connectionDraining"
   ```

   Replace [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] with the name of the backend service identified in step 3. The output should show "connectionDraining: true".

With these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Load Balancers Should Have Connection Draining Enabled In Global Backend Services" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancers Should Have Connection Draining Enabled In Global Backend Services" for GCP using python, follow these steps:

1. Install the `google-cloud-load-balancer` library using pip by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install google-cloud-load-balancer
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules in your python script:

   ```
   from google.cloud import load_balancer_v1
   from google.protobuf import field_mask_pb2
   ```

3. Create a client object for the load balancer API:

   ```
   client = load_balancer_v1.LoadBalancerClient()
   ```

4. Get the existing global backend services:

   ```
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   location = 'your-location'
   parent = f"projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}"
   backend_services = client.list_backend_services(request={"parent": parent})
   ```

5. Loop through the backend services and check if connection draining is enabled. If not, enable it:

   ```
   for backend_service in backend_services:
       if backend_service.connection_draining.draining_timeout_sec == 0:
           update_mask = field_mask_pb2.FieldMask(paths=["connection_draining.draining_timeout_sec"])
           backend_service.connection_draining.draining_timeout_sec = 300
           update_request = {
               "backend_service": backend_service,
               "update_mask": update_mask
           }
           client.update_backend_service(request=update_request)
   ```

   In the above code, we are checking if the `draining_timeout_sec` parameter in the `connection_draining` field is set to 0. If it is, we create an update request to set it to 300 seconds (5 minutes).

6. Run the python script to remediate the misconfiguration.

   ```
   python remediate_load_balancer_connection_draining.py
   ```

   Note: Replace `remediate_load_balancer_connection_draining.py` with the name of your python script.

By following the above steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancers Should Have Connection Draining Enabled In Global Backend Services" for GCP using python.
