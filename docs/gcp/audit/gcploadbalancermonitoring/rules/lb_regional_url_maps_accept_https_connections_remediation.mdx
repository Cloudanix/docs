### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Login to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser and navigate to the GCP Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google Cloud credentials.

2. Navigate to Load Balancing: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner). Scroll down and click on "Network Services", then select "Load balancing".

3. Select the Load Balancer: In the Load balancing page, you will see a list of your load balancers. Click on the name of the load balancer you want to inspect.

4. Check the Frontend Configuration: In the load balancer's details page, scroll down to the "Frontend configuration" section. Here, you can see the protocol used by the load balancer. If it's set to HTTP, then it's not accepting HTTPS connections. If it's set to HTTPS, then it's correctly configured to accept HTTPS connections.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install and authenticate it.

2. Once the gcloud CLI is installed and configured, you can list all the URL maps in your project by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute url-maps list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all URL maps, including their names and the region they are associated with.

3. To check the details of a specific URL map, you can use the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute url-maps describe [URL_MAP_NAME]
   ```
   Replace `[URL_MAP_NAME]` with the name of the URL map you want to inspect. This command will return a detailed description of the URL map, including the backend services it is associated with and the protocols it accepts.

4. To specifically check if the URL map accepts HTTPS connections, you need to look at the `defaultService` field in the output of the previous command. If the URL map accepts HTTPS connections, the `defaultService` field will contain a reference to a backend service that is configured to accept HTTPS connections. If the `defaultService` field does not contain such a reference, the URL map does not accept HTTPS connections.

   Note: This is a basic check. For a more thorough check, you would need to inspect each backend service associated with the URL map and check if they are configured to accept HTTPS connections.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you need to install the Google Cloud SDK and the Python client library. You can do this using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-sdk google-cloud
   ```

2. Authenticate your SDK: Before you can interact with GCP, you need to authenticate your SDK. You can do this using the command:

   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

3. Write a Python script to list all the URL maps and check their settings:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1

   def list_url_maps(project_id):
       client = compute_v1.UrlMapsClient()
       agg_list = client.aggregated_list(project=project_id)
       for item in agg_list:
           if item.url_map:
               url_map = client.get(project=project_id, url_map=item.url_map)
               print(f"URL Map: {url_map.name}")
               print(f"Default Service: {url_map.default_service}")
               for host_rule in url_map.host_rules:
                   print(f"Host: {host_rule.hosts}")
                   print(f"Path Matcher: {host_rule.path_matcher}")
               for path_matcher in url_map.path_matchers:
                   print(f"Path Matcher Name: {path_matcher.name}")
                   for path_rule in path_matcher.path_rules:
                       print(f"Service: {path_rule.service}")
                       print(f"Paths: {path_rule.paths}")
   ```

4. Run the script and check the output: The script will print out the details of all URL maps in your project. You need to check if the default service of each URL map is set to a backend service that accepts HTTPS connections. If it's not, then it's a misconfiguration. You can check this manually or modify the script to do it automatically.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancer Regional Urlmaps Should Accept Https Connections" for GCP using GCP console, you can follow the steps below:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Load Balancing menu.

2. Select the load balancer that you want to update.

3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.

4. Scroll down to the "Frontend configuration" section and click on the "Edit" button next to it.

5. In the "Protocol" drop-down menu, select "HTTPS".

6. Under "Certificate", select the SSL certificate that you want to use for the load balancer.

7. In the "Port numbers" section, enter the port numbers that you want to use for HTTPS connections.

8. Click on the "Update" button to save the changes.

After following these steps, your Load Balancer Regional Urlmaps should accept HTTPS connections and the misconfiguration will be remediated.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Load Balancer Regional Urlmaps Should Accept Https Connections" misconfiguration in GCP, you can follow these steps using GCP CLI:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.
2. Run the following command to list all the URL maps in your project:

   ```
   gcloud compute url-maps list
   ```

3. Identify the URL map that you want to modify and note down its name.
4. Run the following command to update the URL map to accept HTTPS connections:

   ```
   gcloud compute url-maps update [URL_MAP_NAME] --default-service [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --ssl-certificates [SSL_CERTIFICATE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[URL_MAP_NAME]` with the name of the URL map that you want to update, `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of the backend service that you want to use, and `[SSL_CERTIFICATE_NAME]` with the name of the SSL certificate that you want to use for HTTPS connections.

   Note: You can create an SSL certificate using the GCP console or CLI. Refer to the GCP documentation for more information on creating SSL certificates.

5. After running the above command, your URL map will be updated to accept HTTPS connections.

This should remediate the "Load Balancer Regional Urlmaps Should Accept Https Connections" misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancer Regional Urlmaps Should Accept Https Connections" in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

``` python
from google.cloud import compute_v1
```

2. Define the project ID and the name of the load balancer:

``` python
project_id = 'your-project-id'
load_balancer_name = 'your-load-balancer-name'
```

3. Create a client object for the Compute Engine API:

``` python
client = compute_v1.LoadBalancerClient()
```

4. Get the URL map configuration for the load balancer:

``` python
url_map_name = client.get(project=project_id, region='global', load_balancer=load_balancer_name).url_map
url_map = client.get(project=project_id, region='global', url_map=url_map_name)
```

5. Update the URL map to accept HTTPS connections:

``` python
if url_map.host_rules[0].path_matchers[0].default_service.port_name == '80':
    url_map.host_rules[0].path_matchers[0].default_service.port_name = '443'
    url_map.host_rules[0].path_matchers[0].default_service.protocol = 'HTTPS'
    update_mask = ['host_rules.path_matchers.default_service.port_name', 'host_rules.path_matchers.default_service.protocol']
    client.update(project=project_id, region='global', url_map=url_map_name, url_map_resource=url_map, update_mask=update_mask)
```

6. Verify that the update was successful:

``` python
url_map = client.get(project=project_id, region='global', url_map=url_map_name)
if url_map.host_rules[0].path_matchers[0].default_service.port_name == '443' and url_map.host_rules[0].path_matchers[0].default_service.protocol == 'HTTPS':
    print('Load balancer URL map updated successfully.')
else:
    print('Failed to update load balancer URL map.')
```

That's it! This code will update the URL map for the specified load balancer to accept HTTPS connections.
