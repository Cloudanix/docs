### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Load Balancing: From the main navigation menu, select "Networking" and then "Load balancing". This will display a list of all the load balancers configured in your GCP environment.

3. Check Load Balancer Configuration: Click on the name of the load balancer you want to inspect. This will open the load balancer's details page. Here, under the "Frontend configuration" section, you can see the protocol used by the load balancer. If the protocol is HTTP or TCP, it means the load balancer is not using secure listeners.

4. Check Instance Group Configuration: Go back to the main navigation menu, select "Compute Engine" and then "Instance groups". Click on the name of the instance group associated with the load balancer. Check the "Named ports" section. If the protocol is HTTP or TCP, it means the instance group is not using secure listeners.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Once the gcloud CLI is set up, you can list all the instance groups in your project by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute instance-groups list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all instance groups along with their details such as name, location, and network.

3. To check the configuration of a specific instance group, you can use the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute instance-groups get-named-ports INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME
   ```

   Replace `INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME` with the name of the instance group you want to inspect. This command will return the named ports and their associated protocols for the specified instance group.

4. To check if the instance group is using secure listeners, you need to look at the protocol of the named ports. If the protocol is 'HTTPS' or 'SSL', then the instance group is using secure listeners. If the protocol is 'HTTP' or 'TCP', then the instance group is not using secure listeners.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing your Python script, you need to install the necessary libraries. For this task, you will need the `google-cloud` library. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules and initialize the client: In your Python script, you will need to import the necessary modules and initialize the client. Here is how you can do it:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1

   client = compute_v1.TargetHttpsProxiesClient()
   ```

3. List all the target HTTPS proxies: Now, you can list all the target HTTPS proxies in your project. You can do this using the `list()` method of the `TargetHttpsProxiesClient` object. Here is how you can do it:

   ```python
   project = 'your-project-id'  # replace with your project ID
   proxies = client.list(project=project)
   ```

4. Check the SSL policies of the proxies: Finally, you can iterate over the proxies and check their SSL policies. If a proxy does not have an SSL policy, it means that it is not using secure listeners. Here is how you can do it:

   ```python
   for proxy in proxies:
       if not proxy.ssl_policy:
           print(f"Proxy {proxy.name} is not using secure listeners.")
   ```
   
This script will print the names of all the target HTTPS proxies in your project that are not using secure listeners.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancers Global Instance Groups Should Use Secure Listeners" for GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Load Balancing page.

2. Select the Load Balancer that you want to remediate.

3. In the Load Balancer details page, click on the Edit button.

4. In the Edit Load Balancer page, click on the Frontend Configuration tab.

5. In the Frontend Configuration tab, for each protocol (HTTP and HTTPS), select the HTTPS protocol and click on the Create button.

6. In the Create Frontend IP and Port page, enter the required details such as Name, IP address, and Port number.

7. In the Protocol section, select HTTPS and click on the Done button.

8. Repeat steps 5 to 7 for all the protocols that are being used by the Load Balancer.

9. Once all the protocols have been configured with HTTPS, click on the Update button to save the changes.

10. Verify that the Load Balancer is now using secure listeners by accessing the Load Balancer URL using HTTPS protocol.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancers Global Instance Groups Should Use Secure Listeners" for GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancers Global Instance Groups Should Use Secure Listeners" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the steps below:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.

2. Use the following command to list all the global forwarding rules in your project:

   ```
   gcloud compute forwarding-rules list
   ```

3. Identify the global forwarding rule that is associated with the load balancer for which you want to enable secure listeners.

4. Use the following command to update the global forwarding rule to use HTTPS as the protocol:

   ```
   gcloud compute forwarding-rules update [FORWARDING_RULE_NAME] --global --protocol HTTPS
   ```

   Replace [FORWARDING_RULE_NAME] with the name of the global forwarding rule that you identified in step 3.

5. Use the following command to update the global forwarding rule to use a valid SSL certificate:

   ```
   gcloud compute ssl-certificates create [CERTIFICATE_NAME] --certificate [CERTIFICATE_FILE_PATH] --private-key [PRIVATE_KEY_FILE_PATH]
   ```

   Replace [CERTIFICATE_NAME] with a name for your SSL certificate, [CERTIFICATE_FILE_PATH] with the path to your SSL certificate file, and [PRIVATE_KEY_FILE_PATH] with the path to your SSL private key file.

6. Use the following command to update the global forwarding rule to use the SSL certificate:

   ```
   gcloud compute target-https-proxies update [TARGET_PROXY_NAME] --ssl-certificates [CERTIFICATE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace [TARGET_PROXY_NAME] with the name of the target HTTPS proxy associated with the global forwarding rule.

7. Verify that the global forwarding rule is now using HTTPS as the protocol and a valid SSL certificate.

   ```
   gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe [FORWARDING_RULE_NAME] --global
   ```

   Replace [FORWARDING_RULE_NAME] with the name of the global forwarding rule that you updated in step 4.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Load Balancers Global Instance Groups Should Use Secure Listeners" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Load Balancers Global Instance Groups Should Use Secure Listeners" in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries: 

```
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials
```

2. Authenticate with GCP using the below code:

```
credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
service = build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

3. Get a list of all the global forwarding rules:

```
project = 'PROJECT_NAME'
global_forwarding_rules = service.globalForwardingRules().list(project=project).execute()
```

4. Loop through the list of global forwarding rules and check if they are using HTTPS as the protocol:

```
for forwarding_rule in global_forwarding_rules['items']:
    if forwarding_rule['IPProtocol'] == 'TCP' and forwarding_rule['portRange'] == '443':
        # HTTPS is being used as the protocol, so no action is needed
        continue
    else:
        # HTTPS is not being used as the protocol, so update the forwarding rule to use HTTPS
        forwarding_rule_url = forwarding_rule['selfLink']
        forwarding_rule_name = forwarding_rule_url.split('/')[-1]
        forwarding_rule_body = {
            'IPProtocol': 'TCP',
            'portRange': '443'
        }
        service.globalForwardingRules().patch(project=project, forwardingRule=forwarding_rule_name, body=forwarding_rule_body).execute()
```

5. This code will update the global forwarding rules to use HTTPS as the protocol. You can run this code periodically to ensure that any new global forwarding rules are also updated to use HTTPS.

Note: Make sure to replace the `PROJECT_NAME` with your actual project name.
