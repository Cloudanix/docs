### More Info:

Rotate cryptographic keys on a regular schedule. Thus, key rotation should be enabled on all cryptographic keys. Google will handle the rotation of the encryption key itself, so previous data does not need to be re-encrypted before the rotation occurs.

### Risk Level

Medium

### Address

Security, Operational Maturity

### Compliance Standards

CIS, SOC2, GDPR, ISO27001
