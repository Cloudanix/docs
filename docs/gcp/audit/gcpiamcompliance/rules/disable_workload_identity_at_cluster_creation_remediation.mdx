### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console.

2. Navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section. You can do this by clicking on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines at the top left corner), then scroll down and click on "Kubernetes Engine".

3. In the Kubernetes Engine page, you will see a list of all your clusters. Click on the name of the cluster you want to inspect.

4. In the cluster details page, scroll down to the "Security" section. Here, you will see the "Workload Identity" status. If it's disabled, it means that Workload Identity is not enabled at the cluster creation.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Once the gcloud CLI is set up, you can list all the clusters in your project by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud container clusters list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all clusters along with their details.

3. To check the Workload Identity status of a specific cluster, you can use the following command:
   ```
   gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER_NAME] --format='value(workloadIdentityConfig)'
   ```
   Replace [CLUSTER_NAME] with the name of your cluster. This command will return the Workload Identity configuration of the specified cluster.

4. If the output of the above command is empty or returns "None", it means that the Workload Identity is disabled at the cluster creation. If it returns a value, it means that the Workload Identity is enabled.

#### Using Python

To check if Workload Identity is disabled at Cluster Creation in IAM using Python scripts, you can use the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) or the Google Cloud Client Libraries. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client Libraries:**
   First, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK and the Python client libraries. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-sdk
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-container
   ```

2. **Authenticate your SDK:**
   Next, you need to authenticate your SDK to your GCP account. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

3. **Get the list of clusters and their configurations:**
   Now, you can use the Python client libraries to get the list of clusters and their configurations. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import container_v1

   def list_clusters(project_id, zone):
       client = container_v1.ClusterManagerClient()

       response = client.list_clusters(project_id=project_id, zone=zone)

       for cluster in response.clusters:
           print(f"Cluster name: {cluster.name}")
           print(f"Workload Identity: {cluster.workload_identity_config}")

   list_clusters("your-project-id", "your-zone")
   ```

4. **Check if Workload Identity is disabled:**
   The script above will print the configuration of each cluster, including the Workload Identity configuration. If the `workload_identity_config` is `None` or if the `workload_pool` in the `workload_identity_config` is empty, then Workload Identity is disabled.

Please replace "your-project-id" and "your-zone" with your actual project ID and zone.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of disabling workload identity at cluster creation on GCP using GCP console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Kubernetes Engine page.
2. Select the cluster on which you want to enable workload identity.
3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
4. Scroll down to the "Workload Identity" section.
5. Click on the "Enable" button to turn on workload identity for the cluster.
6. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page to apply the changes.

After completing these steps, workload identity will be enabled for your cluster, and you will be able to use it to securely authenticate your applications and services running on GCP.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of disabling Workload Identity at Cluster Creation in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the Cloud Shell from the GCP Console.

Step 2: Run the following command to check if Workload Identity is enabled or not:
```
gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE] | grep workloadIdentityConfig
```

Step 3: If the output shows `workloadIdentityConfig: {}`, then Workload Identity is not enabled for the cluster.

Step 4: To enable Workload Identity for the cluster, run the following command:
```
gcloud container clusters update [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE] --workload-pool=[PROJECT_ID].svc.id.goog
```
Note: Replace `[CLUSTER_NAME]`, `[ZONE]`, and `[PROJECT_ID]` with the appropriate values.

Step 5: Verify that Workload Identity is enabled for the cluster by running the following command:
```
gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE] | grep workloadIdentityConfig
```

Step 6: If the output shows `workloadIdentityConfig: workloadPool: [PROJECT_ID].svc.id.goog`, then Workload Identity is enabled for the cluster.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of disabling Workload Identity at Cluster Creation in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Disable Workload Identity at Cluster Creation" misconfiguration in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the Google Cloud SDK by following the instructions provided in the GCP documentation.
2. Once the SDK is installed, authenticate with your GCP account using the following command:
```
gcloud auth login
```
3. Create a Python script to enable Workload Identity at Cluster Creation. You can use the following code as a starting point:
```
from googleapiclient import discovery
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials

# Set the project ID and zone
project_id = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
zone = 'YOUR_ZONE'

# Authenticate with GCP
credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
service = discovery.build('container', 'v1', credentials=credentials)

# Set the cluster name
cluster_name = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME'

# Get the current cluster configuration
cluster = service.projects().zones().clusters().get(projectId=project_id, zone=zone, clusterId=cluster_name).execute()

# Enable Workload Identity
cluster['workloadIdentityConfig'] = {'enabled': True}

# Update the cluster configuration
response = service.projects().zones().clusters().update(projectId=project_id, zone=zone, clusterId=cluster_name, body=cluster).execute()

# Print the response
print(response)
```
4. Replace the placeholders with your own project ID, zone, and cluster name.
5. Run the Python script using the following command:
```
python script.py
```
6. Verify that Workload Identity has been enabled for the cluster by checking the cluster configuration in the GCP Console or using the following command:
```
gcloud container clusters describe YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --zone YOUR_ZONE --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to make changes to the GCP resources before running the script.
