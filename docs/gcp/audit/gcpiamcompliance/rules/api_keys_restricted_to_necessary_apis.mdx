### More Info:

Security risks involved in using API-Keys are below: • API keys are simple encrypted strings • API keys do not identify the user or the application making the API request • API keys are typically accessible to clients, making it easy to discover and steal an API key In light of these potential risks, Google recommends using the standard authentication flow instead of API-Keys. However, there are limited cases where API keys are more appropriate. For example, if there is a mobile application that needs to use the Google Cloud Translation API, but doesn't otherwise need a backend server, API keys are the simplest way to authenticate to that API. In order to reduce attack surfaces by providing least privileges, API-Keys can be restricted to use (call) only APIs required by an application.

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to IAM & Admin: Once you're logged in, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines) in the top left corner of the console. Scroll down and click on "IAM & Admin".

3. Access IAM: In the IAM & Admin section, click on "IAM". This will display a list of all the IAM roles and permissions in your GCP project.

4. Check API Key Restrictions: In the IAM section, look for any API keys and check their restrictions. If an API key is not restricted to necessary APIs, it means it has access to all APIs, which is a misconfiguration. You can check this by clicking on the pencil icon next to the API key, which will open the "Edit Key" page. Here, you can see the API restrictions applied to the key. If "None" is selected under "API restrictions", it means the key has access to all APIs.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK. If you haven't done this yet, you can follow the instructions provided by Google Cloud.

2. Once you have the Google Cloud SDK installed and initialized, you can list all the API keys in your project using the following command:

    ```
    gcloud alpha services api-keys list
    ```

    This command will return a list of all API keys in your project, along with their associated metadata.

3. To check the restrictions of a specific API key, you can use the following command:

    ```
    gcloud alpha services api-keys describe [API_KEY_ID]
    ```

    Replace `[API_KEY_ID]` with the ID of the API key you want to check. This command will return detailed information about the specified API key, including its restrictions.

4. To check if the API key is restricted to necessary APIs, you need to look at the `restrictions` field in the output of the previous command. If the API key is not restricted to necessary APIs, the `restrictions` field will either be empty or contain APIs that are not necessary for your project.

#### Using Python

1. **Import necessary libraries and establish a connection:**
   First, you need to import the necessary libraries in your Python script. You will need the `boto3` library for AWS, `azure.identity` and `azure.mgmt.resource` for Azure, and `google.cloud` for GCP. After importing the necessary libraries, establish a connection to the respective cloud service.

   ```python
   import boto3
   import azure.identity
   import azure.mgmt.resource
   import google.cloud
   ```

2. **List all API keys:**
   After establishing a connection, list all the API keys in your cloud service. Here is an example of how to do it in AWS using the `boto3` library.

   ```python
   client = boto3.client('iam')
   response = client.list_access_keys()
   ```

   For Azure, you can use the `azure.mgmt.resource` library to list all API keys.

   ```python
   client = azure.mgmt.resource.SubscriptionClient(credential)
   response = client.list()
   ```

   For GCP, you can use the `google.cloud` library to list all API keys.

   ```python
   client = google.cloud.iam_v1.IAMClient()
   response = client.list_service_accounts()
   ```

3. **Check the permissions of each API key:**
   After listing all the API keys, check the permissions of each key. If an API key has more permissions than necessary, it is a misconfiguration. Here is an example of how to do it in AWS.

   ```python
   for key in response['AccessKeyMetadata']:
       key_id = key['AccessKeyId']
       policy = client.get_access_key_last_used(AccessKeyId=key_id)
       print(policy)
   ```

   For Azure and GCP, you will need to use the respective libraries to get the permissions of each API key.

4. **Report the misconfigurations:**
   After checking the permissions of each API key, report the keys that have more permissions than necessary. You can print them out or write them to a file. Here is an example of how to do it.

   ```python
   with open('misconfigurations.txt', 'w') as f:
       for key in misconfigured_keys:
           f.write(f"API Key: {key}\n")
   ```
   
   This will create a text file named `misconfigurations.txt` and write all the misconfigured API keys to it.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure API Keys Are Restricted To Necessary APIs" for GCP using GCP console, please follow the below steps:

1. Login to GCP console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Select the project for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.
3. In the left-hand menu, click on "APIs & Services" and then click on "Credentials".
4. Select the API key that you want to restrict.
5. Under "Key restriction", select "HTTP referrers (web sites)".
6. In the "Website restrictions" section, add the domain name(s) of the websites that are allowed to use this API key.
7. In the "API restrictions" section, select the APIs that are allowed to use this API key.
8. Click on "Save" to apply the changes.

By following these steps, the API key will be restricted to only the necessary APIs and the risk of unauthorized access will be reduced.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of ensuring API keys are restricted to necessary APIs in GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. First, identify the API keys that are not restricted to necessary APIs. You can use the following command to list all the API keys in your project:

```
gcloud beta services api-keys list
```

2. Once you have identified the API keys that are not restricted to necessary APIs, you can use the following command to update the API key and restrict it to specific APIs:

```
gcloud beta services api-keys update [API_KEY_NAME] --restrict-referer=[REFERER_URL] --allowed-apis=[API_LIST]
```

Replace the [API_KEY_NAME] with the name of the API key that you want to update, [REFERER_URL] with the URL of the referring website, and [API_LIST] with the list of APIs that you want to allow for this API key.

3. If you want to restrict the API key to a specific IP address, use the following command:

```
gcloud beta services api-keys update [API_KEY_NAME] --restrict-ip=[IP_ADDRESS] --allowed-apis=[API_LIST]
```

Replace [IP_ADDRESS] with the IP address that you want to allow for this API key.

4. Finally, verify that the API key is now restricted to the necessary APIs by using the following command:

```
gcloud beta services api-keys describe [API_KEY_NAME]
```

This command will display the details of the API key, including the allowed APIs and the restricted referer or IP address.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of ensuring API keys are restricted to necessary APIs in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure API Keys Are Restricted To Necessary APIs" for GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Identify the API keys that are not restricted to necessary APIs. You can do this by using the following command in the GCP Cloud Shell:

   ```
   gcloud beta iam service-accounts keys list --iam-account [SA-NAME] --filter="keyRestrictions.type:unspecified"
   ```

   Replace [SA-NAME] with the name of the service account that you want to check.

2. Create a new API key with restricted access. You can do this by using the following Python code:

   ```
   from google.oauth2 import service_account
   from googleapiclient.discovery import build

   SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform']
   SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = '[PATH TO YOUR SERVICE ACCOUNT JSON FILE]'

   credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
       SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)

   service = build('iamcredentials', 'v1', credentials=credentials)

   response = service.projects().serviceAccounts().keys().create(
       name='projects/-/serviceAccounts/[SA-NAME]',
       body={
           'keyAlgorithm': 'KEY_ALG_RSA_2048',
           'keyRestrictions': {
               'allowedRegions': ['us-central1'],
               'allowedServices': ['storage.googleapis.com']
           }
       }
   ).execute()

   print(response)
   ```

   Replace [PATH TO YOUR SERVICE ACCOUNT JSON FILE] with the path to your service account JSON file, and [SA-NAME] with the name of the service account that you want to create the API key for.

   This code creates an API key with restricted access to the Storage API in the us-central1 region.

3. Delete the old API key. You can do this by using the following command in the GCP Cloud Shell:

   ```
   gcloud beta iam service-accounts keys delete [KEY-ID] --iam-account [SA-NAME]
   ```

   Replace [KEY-ID] with the ID of the old API key that you want to delete, and [SA-NAME] with the name of the service account that the API key belongs to.

4. Verify that the new API key has restricted access. You can do this by using the following command in the GCP Cloud Shell:

   ```
   gcloud beta iam service-accounts keys list --iam-account [SA-NAME] --filter="keyRestrictions.type:asymmetric_public"
   ```

   Replace [SA-NAME] with the name of the service account that you created the new API key for. This command should return the new API key that you just created with restricted access.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure API Keys Are Restricted To Necessary APIs" for GCP using Python.
