### More Info:

Ensure that user-managed service account key upload is disabled within your Google Cloud project, folder, or the entire organization, through the "Disable Service Account Key Upload" organization policy. This allows you to control the upload process of unmanaged long-term credentials for your Cloud IAM service accounts. By default, users can upload keys to service accounts based on their Cloud IAM roles and permissions.

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the GCP Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your GCP account credentials.

2. Navigate to IAM & Admin: Once you're logged in, locate the navigation menu in the top-left corner of the console. Click on it and scroll down to find "IAM & Admin". Click on it to open the IAM & Admin dashboard.

3. Access IAM settings: In the IAM & Admin dashboard, click on "IAM" in the left-hand side menu. This will open a list of all IAM roles and their corresponding members in your GCP project.

4. Check Service Account Key Upload: In the IAM roles list, look for any service accounts (identified by email addresses ending in @project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com). Click on the service account to view its details. If the "Service Account Key Upload" is enabled, you will see keys listed under the "Keys" tab. If no keys are listed, the "Service Account Key Upload" is disabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Authenticate your CLI with your Google Cloud account by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the instructions and log in with your Google Cloud account.

3. List all the service accounts in your project by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud iam service-accounts list
   ```
   This will display a list of all service accounts in your project.

4. For each service account, list all the keys associated with it by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud iam service-accounts keys list --iam-account [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]
   ```
   Replace `[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]` with the email of the service account. This will display a list of all keys associated with the service account. If any key has the `KEY_TYPE` as `USER_MANAGED`, it means that the service account key upload is not disabled.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: To interact with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you need to install the Google Cloud Client Library for Python. You can do this using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-iam
   ```

2. Authenticate your application: Before you can interact with GCP, you need to authenticate your application. You can do this by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key JSON file:

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
   ```

3. Write a Python script to list all service accounts and their keys: The following script uses the IAM API to list all service accounts and their keys in a project:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import iam

   def list_keys(project_id):
       client = iam.ServiceAccountManagerClient()
       for account in client.list_service_accounts(request={"project": project_id}):
           for key in client.list_service_account_keys(request={"name": account.name}):
               print(f"Service account: {account.email} has key: {key.name}")

   list_keys("your-project-id")
   ```
   This script will print the email of each service account and the name of each key.

4. Analyze the output: If the script prints any keys, it means that the service account key upload is not disabled. If no keys are printed, it means that the service account key upload is disabled. 

Remember to replace `"your-project-id"` with your actual project ID.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Disable Service Account Key Upload" misconfiguration in GCP using the GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to your GCP console and navigate to the IAM & Admin section.

2. Click on the "Service Accounts" tab.

3. Select the service account for which you want to disable the key upload.

4. Click on the "Edit" button located at the top of the page.

5. Scroll down to the "Service Account Permissions" section and uncheck the "Create and manage keys" option.

6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

7. Verify that the "Create and manage keys" option is unchecked for the service account.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the "Disable Service Account Key Upload" misconfiguration for the selected service account in GCP using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Disable Service Account Key Upload" misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to disable the Service Account Key Upload:

   ```
   gcloud iam service-accounts keys upload /dev/null --iam-account [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] --quiet
   ```

   Replace [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] with the email address of the service account for which you want to disable the key upload.

3. Verify that the key upload is disabled by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud iam service-accounts describe [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]
   ```

   This command should return the service account details, including the "Disabled" field set to "true".

4. Repeat the above steps for all the service accounts in your GCP project.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the "Disable Service Account Key Upload" misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To disable service account key upload in GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

2. Set up authentication by creating a service account and downloading its JSON key file. Then, create a credentials object using the key file:

```
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path_to_key_file>')
```

3. Create a GCP service object for the IAM API:

```
service = build('iam', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

4. Use the `projects.serviceAccounts.update` method to update the service account configuration:

```
project_id = '<your_project_id>'
service_account_email = '<your_service_account_email>'

request_body = {
    'projectId': project_id,
    'uniqueId': service_account_email,
    'disableKeyUpload': True
}

response = service.projects().serviceAccounts().update(name='projects/-/serviceAccounts/' + service_account_email, body=request_body).execute()
```

5. Verify that the configuration has been updated by checking the `disableKeyUpload` field of the service account:

```
response = service.projects().serviceAccounts().get(name='projects/-/serviceAccounts/' + service_account_email).execute()
print(response['disableKeyUpload'])
```

This should return `True`, indicating that service account key upload has been disabled.
