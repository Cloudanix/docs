### More Info:

Ensure that user-managed service account key upload is disabled within your Google Cloud project, folder, or the entire organization, through the "Disable Service Account Key Upload" organization policy. This allows you to control the upload process of unmanaged long-term credentials for your Cloud IAM service accounts. By default, users can upload keys to service accounts based on their Cloud IAM roles and permissions.

#### Using Python

To disable service account key upload in GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

2. Set up authentication by creating a service account and downloading its JSON key file. Then, create a credentials object using the key file:

```
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path_to_key_file>')
```

3. Create a GCP service object for the IAM API:

```
service = build('iam', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

4. Use the `projects.serviceAccounts.update` method to update the service account configuration:

```
project_id = '<your_project_id>'
service_account_email = '<your_service_account_email>'

request_body = {
    'projectId': project_id,
    'uniqueId': service_account_email,
    'disableKeyUpload': True
}

response = service.projects().serviceAccounts().update(name='projects/-/serviceAccounts/' + service_account_email, body=request_body).execute()
```

5. Verify that the configuration has been updated by checking the `disableKeyUpload` field of the service account:

```
response = service.projects().serviceAccounts().get(name='projects/-/serviceAccounts/' + service_account_email).execute()
print(response['disableKeyUpload'])
```

This should return `True`, indicating that service account key upload has been disabled.
