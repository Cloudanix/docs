<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "User Managed Service Account Should Not Have Admin Privileges" in GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Identify the user-managed service account that has admin privileges using the following command:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts list
```

2. Once you have identified the service account, remove the admin role from the service account using the following command:

```
gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] --role=roles/owner
```

Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your project ID and `[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]` with the email address of the service account.

3. Verify that the admin role has been removed from the service account using the following command:

```
gcloud projects get-iam-policy [PROJECT_ID] --flatten="bindings[].members" --format='table(bindings.role)' --filter="bindings.members:serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]"
```

Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your project ID and `[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]` with the email address of the service account.

This should remediate the misconfiguration "User Managed Service Account Should Not Have Admin Privileges" in GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "User Managed Service Account Should Not Have Admin Privileges" in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to identify all the user-managed service accounts that have admin privileges. You can use the following code to do this:

```
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

# Set the required scopes
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform']

# Set the credentials using the service account key file
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/service_account_key.json', scopes=SCOPES)

# Build the IAM Service client object
iam_service = build('iam', 'v1', credentials=credentials)

# Get all the IAM policies for the project
policy = iam_service.projects().getIamPolicy(resource='projects/PROJECT_ID').execute()

# Get all the user-managed service accounts with admin privileges
for binding in policy['bindings']:
    if 'roles/owner' in binding['role']:
        for member in binding['members']:
            if 'user-managed' in member:
                print(f"{member} has admin privileges")
```

Replace `path/to/service_account_key.json` with the path to your service account key file and `PROJECT_ID` with your GCP project ID.

2. Once you have identified the user-managed service accounts with admin privileges, you can remove the admin role from them using the following code:

```
from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError

# Set the user-managed service account email
user_managed_service_account = 'user-managed-service-account@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

# Set the role to be removed
role = 'roles/owner'

# Build the IAM Service client object
iam_service = build('iam', 'v1', credentials=credentials)

# Get the current IAM policy for the project
policy = iam_service.projects().getIamPolicy(resource='projects/PROJECT_ID').execute()

# Remove the role from the user-managed service account
for binding in policy['bindings']:
    if role in binding['role'] and user_managed_service_account in binding['members']:
        binding['members'].remove(user_managed_service_account)

# Update the IAM policy for the project
try:
    updated_policy = iam_service.projects().setIamPolicy(resource='projects/PROJECT_ID', body={'policy': policy}).execute()
    print(f"{user_managed_service_account} no longer has admin privileges")
except HttpError as e:
    print(f"Error updating IAM policy: {e}")
```

Replace `PROJECT_ID` with your GCP project ID and set the `user_managed_service_account` variable to the email address of the user-managed service account that you want to remove the admin role from.

These steps will remediate the misconfiguration "User Managed Service Account Should Not Have Admin Privileges" in GCP using Python.
