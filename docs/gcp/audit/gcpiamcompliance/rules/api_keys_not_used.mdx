### More Info:

Security risks involved in using API-Keys appear below: • API keys are simple encrypted strings • API keys do not identify the user or the application making the API request • API keys are typically accessible to clients, making it easy to discover and steal an API key To avoid the security risk in using API keys, it is recommended to use standard authentication flow instead.

### Risk Level

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Login to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to IAM & Admin: Once you are logged in, locate the navigation menu on the left-hand side of the console. Click on the menu icon (three horizontal lines), then scroll down and click on "IAM & Admin".

3. Open IAM: In the IAM & Admin section, click on "IAM". This will open a list of all IAM roles and permissions associated with your Google Cloud Platform project.

4. Check for API Keys: In the IAM section, look for any API keys associated with your project. If any API keys are found, this indicates a misconfiguration as API keys should not be created for a project in IAM.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK if you haven't done so already. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions provided.

2. Once the SDK is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and authenticate your Google Cloud account by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to log in with your Google account.

3. Set your project ID to the project you want to check. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual project ID in the following command:
   ```
   gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

4. Now, you can list all the API keys for your project by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud alpha services api-keys list
   ```
   If any API keys are listed in the output, it means that API keys have been created for the project. If no API keys are listed, then no API keys have been created for the project.

#### Using Python

1. **Import the necessary libraries**: To interact with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you need to import the `googleapiclient` library. This library allows you to interact with GCP services like IAM. You also need to import `google.auth` to authenticate your script with GCP.

    ```python
    from googleapiclient import discovery
    from google.auth import exceptions
    from google.oauth2 import service_account
    ```

2. **Authenticate with GCP**: Before you can interact with GCP services, you need to authenticate your script. You can do this by creating a service account in GCP and downloading the JSON key file. Then, use the `service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file` function to authenticate your script.

    ```python
    try:
        credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/your/service-account-file.json')
    except exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError as e:
        print(f"Failed to load GCP credentials: {e}")
        return
    ```

3. **Create a service client**: After authenticating, you can create a service client to interact with IAM. Use the `discovery.build` function to create a service client.

    ```python
    try:
        service = discovery.build('iam', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to create service client: {e}")
        return
    ```

4. **Check for API keys**: Now that you have a service client, you can use it to check for API keys. Call the `projects().serviceAccounts().keys().list` method on the service client to get a list of all API keys. If the list is not empty, then API keys have been created for the project.

    ```python
    try:
        response = service.projects().serviceAccounts().keys().list(name='projects/my-project/serviceAccounts/my-service-account').execute()
        if 'keys' in response and len(response['keys']) > 0:
            print("API keys have been created for the project.")
        else:
            print("No API keys have been created for the project.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to check for API keys: {e}")
    ```
Please replace 'path/to/your/service-account-file.json', 'projects/my-project/serviceAccounts/my-service-account' with your actual service account file path and project details.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of API keys not being created for a project in GCP, you can follow the below steps using the GCP console:

1. Go to the GCP console and select the project for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

2. Navigate to the "APIs & Services" section from the left-hand side menu.

3. Click on the "Credentials" tab from the top menu.

4. On the Credentials page, you will see a list of all the existing credentials for the project.

5. Look for any API keys that have been created for the project. If you find any, select them and click on the "Delete" button to remove them.

6. If there are no API keys, then the misconfiguration is already remediated.

7. To prevent API keys from being created in the future, you can go to the "APIs & Services" section and click on the "Restrict keys" button.

8. On the Restrict keys page, select the "Do not restrict key" option and click on the "Save" button.

9. This will prevent any API keys from being created for the project in the future.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of API keys not being created for a project in GCP.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure API Keys Are Not Created For A Project" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.
2. Run the following command to list all the projects in your GCP account:

```
gcloud projects list
```

3. Select the project for which you want to ensure that API keys are not created.
4. Run the following command to check if any API keys are created for the selected project:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts keys list --iam-account [SA-NAME]@[PROJECT-ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Note: Replace `[SA-NAME]` with the name of the service account and `[PROJECT-ID]` with the ID of the selected project.

5. If any API keys are listed, delete them using the following command:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts keys delete [KEY-ID] --iam-account [SA-NAME]@[PROJECT-ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Note: Replace `[KEY-ID]` with the ID of the API key you want to delete, `[SA-NAME]` with the name of the service account and `[PROJECT-ID]` with the ID of the selected project.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for all the service accounts in the selected project.
7. Once all the API keys are deleted, ensure that the service accounts are not granted any unnecessary permissions.
8. Verify that no API keys are created for the selected project using the following command:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts keys list --iam-account [SA-NAME]@[PROJECT-ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Note: Replace `[SA-NAME]` with the name of the service account and `[PROJECT-ID]` with the ID of the selected project.

9. If no API keys are listed, the remediation is complete.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of ensuring API keys are not created for a project in GCP, you can use the following steps using Python:

1. First, authenticate to your GCP project using the `google-auth` library. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install google-auth
```

2. Next, use the `google-cloud-resource-manager` library to retrieve the list of all projects in your GCP account. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install google-cloud-resource-manager
```

3. Once you have the list of projects, loop through each project and check if there are any active API keys associated with it. You can use the `google-cloud-kms` library to list the keys associated with a project:

```
pip install google-cloud-kms
```

4. If you find any active API keys associated with a project, you can delete them using the `google-cloud-kms` library:

```python
from google.cloud import kms_v1

kms_client = kms_v1.KeyManagementServiceClient()

# Replace [PROJECT_ID] and [KEY_RING_ID] with your project and key ring IDs
parent = kms_client.key_ring_path('[PROJECT_ID]', '[KEY_RING_ID]')

# Replace [KEY_ID] with the ID of the key to delete
key_id = kms_client.crypto_key_path('[PROJECT_ID]', '[KEY_RING_ID]', '[KEY_ID]')

# Delete the key
kms_client.destroy_crypto_key(key_id)
```

5. Finally, you can revoke the API key using the `google-auth` library:

```python
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials

# Replace [API_KEY] with the API key to revoke
creds = Credentials.from_api_key('[API_KEY]')

# Revoke the API key
creds.revoke()
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that API keys are not created for a project in GCP and remediate any existing misconfigurations.
