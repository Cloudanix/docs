### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Login to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the GCP Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in with your GCP account credentials.

2. Navigate to IAM & Admin: Once you are logged in, look for the navigation menu icon (three horizontal lines) at the top left corner of the GCP Console. Click on it and a sidebar will appear. Scroll down and click on "IAM & Admin".

3. Access IAM Settings: In the IAM & Admin page, click on "Settings" in the left side menu. This will open the IAM settings page where you can view and manage your IAM settings.

4. Check Audit Logging Mode: In the IAM settings page, look for the "Audit Logging" section. Here, you can check if the "Detailed Audit Logging Mode" is enforced. If it is enforced, it should be enabled and you should see a green check mark next to it. If it is not enforced, it will be disabled and you will see a red cross mark next to it.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Once the SDK is installed, authenticate your Google Cloud account by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to log in with your Google Cloud account.

3. Set your active project to the one you want to check the IAM audit logging for. You can do this with the following command:
   ```
   gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```
   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of your project.

4. Now, you can check the IAM policy for your project with the following command:
   ```
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy [PROJECT_ID]
   ```
   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of your project. This command will return a JSON object that contains the IAM policy for your project.

5. In the returned JSON object, look for the `auditConfigs` field. This field contains the audit logging configuration for your project. If the `auditConfigs` field is not present or if it does not contain an entry for `allServices`, then detailed audit logging is not enforced for your project.

#### Using Python

To check if detailed audit logging mode is enforced in IAM, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Set up AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

   Then, you need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by using the AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws configure
   ```

   You will be asked to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.

2. **Create a Python script to list IAM policies:**
   You can use the `list_policies` method of the IAM client in Boto3 to list all the IAM policies. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create an IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # List policies
   response = iam.list_policies(Scope='All')
   for policy in response['Policies']:
       print(policy['PolicyName'])
   ```

3. **Check if the CloudTrail policy is attached:**
   Detailed audit logging in AWS is typically achieved by using AWS CloudTrail. Therefore, you need to check if the CloudTrail policy is attached to your IAM roles. You can use the `list_attached_role_policies` method of the IAM client for this. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create an IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # List roles
   roles = iam.list_roles()
   for role in roles['Roles']:
       # List attached policies for each role
       policies = iam.list_attached_role_policies(RoleName=role['RoleName'])
       for policy in policies['AttachedPolicies']:
           if policy['PolicyName'] == 'AWSCloudTrailFullAccess':
               print(f"The role {role['RoleName']} has the CloudTrail policy attached.")
   ```

4. **Check the CloudTrail configuration:**
   Finally, you need to check the configuration of CloudTrail to ensure that it is set up correctly for detailed audit logging. You can use the `describe_trails` and `get_trail_status` methods of the CloudTrail client in Boto3 for this. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a CloudTrail client
   cloudtrail = boto3.client('cloudtrail')

   # Describe trails
   trails = cloudtrail.describe_trails()
   for trail in trails['trailList']:
       # Get trail status
       status = cloudtrail.get_trail_status(Name=trail['Name'])
       if status['IsLogging'] and status['LatestCloudWatchLogsDeliveryTime']:
           print(f"The trail {trail['Name']} is logging and delivering logs to CloudWatch.")
   ```
   
Please note that these scripts only provide basic functionality and may need to be adjusted based on your specific requirements.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not enforcing detailed audit logging mode in GCP, you can follow the steps below using the GCP console:

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Console.

2. Navigate to the "Logging" page by clicking on the hamburger menu on the top left corner of the page and selecting "Logging" under the "TOOLS" section.

3. Click on "Log Router" on the left-hand side of the page.

4. Click on "Create Sink" at the top of the page.

5. In the "Create Sink" page, enter a name for the sink in the "Name" field.

6. In the "Sink Service" field, select the service you want to enable detailed audit logging for. For example, you can select "Cloud Storage".

7. In the "Sink Destination" field, select "BigQuery" or "Cloud Pub/Sub" as the destination for the logs.

8. In the "Sink Filter" field, enter the filter expression to specify the logs you want to collect. For example, you can enter "protoPayload.serviceName=storage.googleapis.com" to collect logs related to Cloud Storage.

9. Click on "Create Sink" to create the sink.

10. Repeat steps 4 to 9 for each service you want to enable detailed audit logging for.

By following these steps, you will have enabled detailed audit logging mode for the selected GCP services and can now monitor and analyze the logs for security and compliance purposes.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Enforce Detailed Audit Logging Mode" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.
2. Run the following command to enable audit logging for all services in the current project:

```
gcloud alpha logging configs create --project [PROJECT_ID] --service all --data-access all --log-type audit --exempted-members user:[USER_EMAIL]
```

Note: Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of your GCP project and `[USER_EMAIL]` with the email address of the user who should be exempted from audit logging.

3. Run the following command to verify that audit logging is enabled:

```
gcloud alpha logging configs describe --project [PROJECT_ID] --config-type data-access --config-name all
```

This command should return the configuration details for audit logging.

4. Run the following command to enable enforced audit logging mode:

```
gcloud alpha logging configs update --project [PROJECT_ID] --config-type data-access --config-name all --enforced true
```

This command will enable enforced audit logging mode for all services in the current project.

5. Run the following command to verify that enforced audit logging mode is enabled:

```
gcloud alpha logging configs describe --project [PROJECT_ID] --config-type data-access --config-name all
```

This command should return the configuration details for enforced audit logging mode.

6. Verify that audit logs are being generated for all services in the project by checking the audit logs in the Logging console.

By following these steps, you will remediate the misconfiguration "Enforce Detailed Audit Logging Mode" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Enforce Detailed Audit Logging Mode" in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Install the necessary packages

```
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-cloud-logging
```

Step 2: Set the project ID and the log sink name

```
project_id = "your-project-id"
sink_name = "your-sink-name"
```

Step 3: Create a client object for the Logging API

```
from google.cloud import logging_v2
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/service/account/key.json')
client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client(credentials=credentials)
```

Step 4: Create a sink filter to include all audit logs

```
filter = "logName:\"logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com\""
```

Step 5: Create a sink object with the filter and destination

```
from google.cloud.logging_v2.types import LogSink

destination = f"bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/{project_id}/datasets/audit_logs"
sink = LogSink(
    name=sink_name,
    filter=filter,
    destination=destination
)
```

Step 6: Create or update the sink in the project

```
from google.api_core.exceptions import AlreadyExists

try:
    response = client.create_sink(
        parent=f"projects/{project_id}",
        sink=sink
    )
    print(f"Sink created: {response.name}")
except AlreadyExists:
    response = client.update_sink(
        sink_name,
        sink,
        update_mask=["filter", "destination"]
    )
    print(f"Sink updated: {response.name}")
```

Step 7: Verify that the sink is created and that audit logs are being exported

```
response = client.list_sinks(f"projects/{project_id}")
for sink in response:
    print(sink.name)
```

This will create or update the sink in the project and start exporting all audit logs to BigQuery. You can verify that the sink is created and that audit logs are being exported by checking the output of the `list_sinks` method.
