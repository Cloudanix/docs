### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud SQL Instances: From the left-hand side menu, select "SQL" under the "Storage" section. This will display a list of all your Cloud SQL instances.

3. Check Encryption Settings: Click on the name of the Cloud SQL instance you want to check. This will open the instance details page. Scroll down to the "Encryption" section. If the "Data encryption" field is set to "Google-managed key", then the default Google-managed encryption is not restricted for this Cloud SQL instance.

4. Repeat for All Instances: Repeat steps 3 for all Cloud SQL instances in your GCP project. If any instance is using the default Google-managed encryption, then this misconfiguration is present.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI if you haven't done so already. You can do this by following the instructions provided by Google Cloud at https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install.

2. Once the SDK is installed and configured, you can list all the Cloud SQL instances in your project by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all Cloud SQL instances in your project, along with some basic information about each instance.

3. To check the encryption settings for a specific Cloud SQL instance, you can use the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
   ```
   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of the instance you want to check. This command will return a detailed description of the specified instance, including its encryption settings.

4. Look for the "diskEncryptionConfiguration" field in the output. If this field is not present or if it is set to "GOOGLE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION", then the instance is using Google-managed encryption keys. If the field is set to "CUSTOMER_MANAGED_ENCRYPTION", then the instance is using customer-managed encryption keys.

#### Using Python

To check the restriction of default Google-managed encryption for Cloud SQL instances in IAM using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set up Google Cloud SDK and Python Environment:**
   Before you start, make sure you have installed Google Cloud SDK and Python on your local machine. Also, you need to authenticate your SDK using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. **Install Required Python Libraries:**
   You need to install the `google-cloud-sql` Python library. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-sql
   ```

3. **Create a Python Script:**
   Create a Python script that uses the Google Cloud SQL library to list all the Cloud SQL instances and check their encryption configuration. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import sql

   def list_instances(project_id):
       client = sql.SqlAdminServiceClient()
       instances = client.list_instances(project_id)
       for instance in instances:
           print(f"Instance ID: {instance.id}")
           print(f"Instance Encryption: {instance.disk_encryption_configuration.kind}")
           if instance.disk_encryption_configuration.kind == 'sql#diskEncryptionConfiguration':
               print("Google-managed encryption is enabled.")
           else:
               print("Google-managed encryption is not enabled.")

   list_instances('your-project-id')
   ```
   Replace 'your-project-id' with your actual Google Cloud project ID.

4. **Run the Python Script:**
   Run the Python script from your command line:
   ```
   python check_encryption.py
   ```
   This script will print out the ID and encryption status of each Cloud SQL instance in your project. If the encryption kind is 'sql#diskEncryptionConfiguration', it means that Google-managed encryption is enabled for that instance.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of "Restrict Default Google-Managed Encryption for Cloud SQL Instances" in GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to your GCP console.

2. Navigate to the Cloud SQL Instances page.

3. Select the instance for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

4. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.

5. Scroll down to the "Encryption" section.

6. Under the "Encryption in transit" section, select "Require SSL" option.

7. Under the "Encryption at rest" section, select "Customer-managed encryption key" option.

8. Provide the required details for Customer-managed encryption key, such as key name, key version and key location.

9. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

10. Verify the changes by checking the "Encryption" section on the Cloud SQL instance page.

By following the above steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of "Restrict Default Google-Managed Encryption for Cloud SQL Instances" in GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of "Restrict Default Google-Managed Encryption for Cloud SQL Instances" for GCP using GCP CLI, you need to follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Shell by clicking on the Activate Cloud Shell button present on the top right corner of the Google Cloud Console.

2. Once you have opened the Google Cloud Shell, run the following command to set the project where you want to remediate the misconfiguration:

   ```
   gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace [PROJECT_ID] with the ID of the project where you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

3. Next, run the following command to list all the Cloud SQL instances in the project:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances list
   ```

4. Identify the Cloud SQL instance for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration and note down its name.

5. Run the following command to update the Cloud SQL instance configuration and restrict default Google-managed encryption:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances patch [INSTANCE_NAME] --require-ssl --backup-start-time 00:00
   ```

   Replace [INSTANCE_NAME] with the name of the Cloud SQL instance for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

6. After running the above command, the default Google-managed encryption will be restricted for the Cloud SQL instance.

   Note: The above command also enforces SSL connections and sets the backup start time to 00:00.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of "Restrict Default Google-Managed Encryption for Cloud SQL Instances" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Restrict Default Google-Managed Encryption for Cloud SQL Instances" misconfiguration in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
from googleapiclient import discovery
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials
```

2. Authenticate and authorize the client:

```
for instance in instances['items']:
    instance_name = instance['name']
    settings = instance['settings']
    settings['dataDiskEncryptionEnabled'] = True
    settings['dataDiskEncryptionCipher'] = 'AES_256'
    settings['backupConfiguration']['binaryLogEnabled'] = False
    settings['backupConfiguration']['enabled'] = True
    settings['backupConfiguration']['pointInTimeRecoveryEnabled'] = True
    settings['backupConfiguration']['replicationLogArchivingEnabled'] = False
