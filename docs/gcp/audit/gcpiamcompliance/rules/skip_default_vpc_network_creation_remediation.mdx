### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform web console and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Select the Project: From the top menu, select the appropriate project where you want to check the IAM configuration.

3. Navigate to IAM & Admin: On the left-hand side menu, click on "IAM & Admin". This will open the IAM & Admin dashboard where you can manage all IAM related configurations.

4. Check the IAM Policy: In the IAM & Admin dashboard, click on "IAM" to view the list of IAM roles and permissions. Here, you can check if the "Skip Default VPC Network Creation" is enabled or not. If it is enabled, it means that when a new project is created, a default VPC network is not automatically created.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website. After installation, authenticate your account using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. Set your project: Use the command `gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]` to set the project you want to check. Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual project ID.

3. List all networks: Use the command `gcloud compute networks list` to list all the networks in the current project. The default VPC network is usually named "default".

4. Check for default VPC network: If the "default" network is listed in the output of the previous command, then the "Skip Default VPC Network Creation" setting is not enabled. If the "default" network is not listed, then the setting is enabled.

#### Using Python

To check if the "Skip Default VPC Network Creation" is enabled in IAM using Python scripts, you can use the Boto3 library for AWS, Azure SDK for Python for Azure, and Google Cloud Client Library for Python for GCP. Here are the steps:

1. AWS:
   - Import the Boto3 library and initialize the EC2 resource.
   - Use the `describe_vpcs` method to get a list of all VPCs.
   - If the default VPC is present, then "Skip Default VPC Network Creation" is not enabled.
```python
import boto3
ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
vpcs = ec2.describe_vpcs()
for vpc in vpcs['Vpcs']:
    if vpc['IsDefault'] == True:
        print("Default VPC is present")
```

2. Azure:
   - Import the Azure SDK and initialize the Network Management Client.
   - Use the `list_all` method to get a list of all VPCs.
   - If the default VPC is present, then "Skip Default VPC Network Creation" is not enabled.
```python
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
vpcs = network_client.virtual_networks.list_all()
for vpc in vpcs:
    if vpc.is_default:
        print("Default VPC is present")
```

3. GCP:
   - Import the Google Cloud Client Library and initialize the Compute service.
   - Use the `aggregatedList` method to get a list of all VPCs.
   - If the default VPC is present, then "Skip Default VPC Network Creation" is not enabled.
```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1
compute = compute_v1.NetworksClient()
vpcs = compute.aggregated_list(project=project_id)
for vpc in vpcs:
    if vpc.is_default:
        print("Default VPC is present")
```

Please note that these scripts only check if the default VPC is present. They do not check if the "Skip Default VPC Network Creation" setting is enabled or not. This setting can only be checked during the creation of a new VPC.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Skip Default VPC Network Creation" in GCP using the GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the VPC networks page.
2. Click on the "Create VPC network" button.
3. In the "Name" field, enter a name for the VPC network.
4. In the "IPv4 CIDR block" field, enter the CIDR block for the VPC network. For example, you can use the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16.
5. Under the "Subnets" section, click on the "Add subnet" button.
6. In the "Name" field, enter a name for the subnet.
7. In the "Region" field, select the region where you want to create the subnet.
8. In the "IP address range" field, enter the IP address range for the subnet. For example, you can use the IP address range 10.0.0.0/24.
9. Click on the "Create" button to create the VPC network and the subnet.

By following the above steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Skip Default VPC Network Creation" in GCP using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Skip Default VPC Network Creation" misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.
2. Run the following command to list all the existing VPC networks in your project: 

```
gcloud compute networks list
```

3. If you do not have any custom VPC network created, you can create a new one using the following command:

```
gcloud compute networks create <network-name> --subnet-mode=auto
```

Note: Replace `<network-name>` with a name of your choice.

4. If you have an existing custom VPC network, you can use that instead of creating a new one.

5. Once the custom VPC network is created, you can create subnets in it using the following command:

```
gcloud compute networks subnets create <subnet-name> --network=<network-name> --region=<region>
```

Note: Replace `<subnet-name>` with a name of your choice, `<network-name>` with the name of the custom VPC network created in step 3 or 4, and `<region>` with the region where you want to create the subnet.

6. You can repeat step 5 to create multiple subnets in the custom VPC network.

7. Once the subnets are created, you can launch your instances in the custom VPC network and the subnets created in it.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Skip Default VPC Network Creation" misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Skip Default VPC Network Creation" misconfiguration in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to create a new VPC network in GCP. You can use the following Python code to create a new VPC network:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def create_vpc_network(project_id, network_name, subnet_name, region):
    """
    This function creates a new VPC network and subnet in the specified region.
    """
    client = compute_v1.NetworksClient()
    subnet_client = compute_v1.SubnetworksClient()

    # Build the network object
    network = {
        "name": network_name,
        "auto_create_subnetworks": False,
    }

    # Create the network
    operation = client.insert(project=project_id, body=network)
    operation.wait()

    # Build the subnet object
    subnet = {
        "name": subnet_name,
        "ip_cidr_range": "10.0.0.0/24",
        "region": region,
        "network": f"projects/{project_id}/global/networks/{network_name}",
    }

    # Create the subnet
    subnet_operation = subnet_client.insert(project=project_id, region=region, body=subnet)
    subnet_operation.wait()

    print(f"Created VPC network '{network_name}' and subnet '{subnet_name}' in region '{region}'.")
```

2. Once you have created the new VPC network, you can modify your GCP project to use this new network as the default VPC network. You can use the following Python code to modify the project:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def set_default_network(project_id, network_name):
    """
    This function sets the specified VPC network as the default network for the project.
    """
    client = compute_v1.ProjectsClient()

    # Build the project object
    project = {
        "name": f"projects/{project_id}",
        "defaultNetworkTier": "PREMIUM",
        "autoCreateNetwork": False,
        "network": f"projects/{project_id}/global/networks/{network_name}",
    }

    # Update the project
    operation = client.update(project=project["name"], body=project)
    operation.wait()

    print(f"Set VPC network '{network_name}' as the default network for project '{project_id}'.")
```

3. Finally, you can call the above two functions to create a new VPC network and set it as the default network for your GCP project. You can use the following Python code to do this:

```python
project_id = "your-project-id"
network_name = "your-network-name"
subnet_name = "your-subnet-name"
region = "your-region"

create_vpc_network(project_id, network_name, subnet_name, region)
set_default_network(project_id, network_name)
```

By following the above steps, you can remediate the "Skip Default VPC Network Creation" misconfiguration in GCP using Python.
