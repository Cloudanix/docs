<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Disable User-Managed Key Creation for Service Accounts" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the Google Cloud Shell or Terminal window.

Step 2: Run the following command to check the current status of User-Managed Key Creation for Service Accounts:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] --format=json > policy.json
```

Replace [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] with the email address of the service account for which you want to check the User-Managed Key Creation status.

Step 3: Open the policy.json file in an editor and check the "bindings" section for the following entry:

```
"members": [
    "user:*",
    "serviceAccount:*",
    "group:*"
],
"role": "roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin"
```

If this entry is present, it means that User-Managed Key Creation is enabled for the service account.

Step 4: To disable User-Managed Key Creation, run the following command:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts set-iam-policy [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] policy.json --quiet
```

Replace [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] with the email address of the service account for which you want to disable User-Managed Key Creation.

Step 5: Open the policy.json file in an editor and remove the following entry from the "bindings" section:

```
{
    "members": [
        "user:*",
        "serviceAccount:*",
        "group:*"
    ],
    "role": "roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin"
}
```

Step 6: Save the policy.json file and run the following command to update the policy for the service account:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts set-iam-policy [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] policy.json --quiet
```

Replace [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] with the email address of the service account for which you want to update the policy.

After following these steps, User-Managed Key Creation will be disabled for the specified service account.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Disable User-Managed Key Creation for Service Accounts" in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```python
from googleapiclient import discovery
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

2. Set up the credentials for the service account that has the necessary permissions to make changes to the GCP project:

```python
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    '/path/to/service_account_key.json')
```

3. Create a `ServiceUsage` client object:

```python
serviceusage = discovery.build('serviceusage', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

4. Retrieve the current state of the `iam.googleapis.com` service:

```python
service_name = 'iam.googleapis.com'
parent = 'projects/PROJECT_ID'
services = serviceusage.services().list(parent=parent).execute()
service = next((s for s in services['services'] if s['config']['name'] == service_name), None)
```

5. Check if user-managed keys are currently allowed for service accounts:

```python
if 'iam.googleapis.com/allowServiceAccountKeyCreation' not in service['config']['acquirerSettings']:
    print('User-managed keys are already disabled for service accounts.')
else:
    print('User-managed keys are currently allowed for service accounts.')
```

6. If user-managed keys are currently allowed, update the service configuration to disable them:

```python
if 'iam.googleapis.com/allowServiceAccountKeyCreation' not in service['config']['acquirerSettings']:
    print('User-managed keys are already disabled for service accounts.')
else:
    print('Disabling user-managed keys for service accounts...')
    service['config']['acquirerSettings']['iam.googleapis.com/allowServiceAccountKeyCreation'] = False
    serviceusage.services().patch(name=service['name'], body=service).execute()
    print('User-managed keys have been disabled for service accounts.')
```

Note: Replace `PROJECT_ID` with the ID of the GCP project you want to remediate. Also, make sure that the service account key file (`service_account_key.json`) has the necessary permissions to make changes to the GCP project.
