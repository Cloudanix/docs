<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
The "Keys Should Be Managed By Google" misconfiguration in GCP means that there are service account keys being used that are not managed by Google. To remediate this issue, you can follow these steps using the GCP CLI:

1. Identify the service account keys that are not managed by Google:
```
gcloud iam service-accounts keys list --iam-account [SERVICE-ACCOUNT-EMAIL]
```
Note: Replace [SERVICE-ACCOUNT-EMAIL] with the email address of the service account that you want to check.

2. Delete the non-managed service account keys:
```
gcloud iam service-accounts keys delete [KEY-ID] --iam-account [SERVICE-ACCOUNT-EMAIL]
```
Note: Replace [KEY-ID] with the ID of the non-managed key and [SERVICE-ACCOUNT-EMAIL] with the email address of the service account that you want to delete the key from.

3. Enable automatic rotation of service account keys:
```
gcloud beta iam service-accounts keys create [KEY-NAME] --iam-account [SERVICE-ACCOUNT-EMAIL] --key-usage=sign-for-digital-signature --rotation-period=90d --next-rotation-time=60d
```
Note: Replace [KEY-NAME] with a name for the new key, [SERVICE-ACCOUNT-EMAIL] with the email address of the service account that you want to enable automatic rotation for, and adjust the rotation period and next rotation time to meet your requirements.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Keys Should Be Managed By Google" misconfiguration in GCP using the GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the "Keys Should Be Managed By Google" misconfiguration for GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Google Cloud SDK and authenticate to your GCP project using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. Install the `google-cloud-iam` Python library using the command `pip install google-cloud-iam`.

3. Write a Python script that uses the `google-cloud-iam` library to remove any non-Google-managed service account keys. Here's an example script:

```python
from google.cloud import iam

# Replace [PROJECT_ID] with your GCP project ID
client = iam.IAMClient(project="[PROJECT_ID]")

# Get a list of all service accounts in the project
accounts = client.list_service_accounts()

# Loop through each service account
for account in accounts:
    # Get a list of all keys for the service account
    keys = client.list_service_account_keys(account.name)

    # Loop through each key
    for key in keys:
        # Check if the key is user-managed
        if not key.key_origin.startswith("google"):
            # Delete the key
            client.delete_service_account_key(key.name)
```

4. Run the Python script using the command `python script.py`. This will remove any non-Google-managed service account keys in your GCP project.

Note: Before running the script, make sure to review and understand the impact of removing non-Google-managed service account keys in your GCP project.
