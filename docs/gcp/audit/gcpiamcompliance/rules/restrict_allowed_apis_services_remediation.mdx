### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser and navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com). Enter your login credentials to access your GCP account.

2. Navigate to IAM & Admin: Once you're logged in, look for the navigation menu on the top left corner of the console. Click on it and scroll down to find "IAM & Admin". Click on it to open the IAM & Admin dashboard.

3. Check IAM Policies: In the IAM & Admin dashboard, click on "IAM" in the left-hand menu. This will display a list of all IAM policies in your GCP account. Look for any policies that have broad or unrestricted access to Google Cloud APIs and services.

4. Review Service Accounts: Go back to the IAM & Admin dashboard and click on "Service Accounts" in the left-hand menu. Review each service account to ensure they only have access to the necessary Google Cloud APIs and services. If a service account has access to more APIs and services than necessary, it could be a sign of a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine and authenticate it. You can download the SDK from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. After installation, authenticate the SDK using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   This command will open a new window in your web browser asking you to log in with your Google account. Once you've logged in, the SDK will be authenticated.

2. List all the projects: Use the following command to list all the projects in your GCP account:

   ```
   gcloud projects list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the projects in your account, along with their project IDs and names.

3. Select a project: To check the allowed APIs and services for a specific project, you need to select that project using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```
   Replace [PROJECT_ID] with the ID of the project you want to check.

4. List the enabled services: Finally, use the following command to list all the enabled APIs and services for the selected project:

   ```
   gcloud services list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the enabled APIs and services for the project. If there are any services that shouldn't be enabled, it means there's a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. **Setup Google Cloud SDK and Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up the Google Cloud SDK and Python environment. You can do this by installing the Google Cloud SDK and setting up the Python environment on your local machine. You can use the following commands to install the Google Cloud SDK and Python:

   ```bash
   # Install Google Cloud SDK
   curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
   exec -l $SHELL
   gcloud init

   # Setup Python environment
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
   ```

2. **Authenticate and Initialize Google Cloud SDK:**
   You need to authenticate your Google Cloud SDK with your Google Cloud account. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

3. **Create a Python Script to List All Services:**
   You can create a Python script that uses the Google Cloud APIs to list all the services that are enabled for your project. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   from googleapiclient import discovery
   from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError
   from google.auth import exceptions

   def list_services(project_id):
       try:
           service = discovery.build('serviceusage', 'v1', cache_discovery=False)
           request = service.services().list(parent='projects/' + project_id)
           response = request.execute()

           for service in response['services']:
               print('Service: {}, State: {}'.format(service['config']['name'], service['state']))

       except (HttpError, exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError) as error:
           print('An error occurred: {}'.format(error))

   list_services('your-project-id')
   ```

4. **Run the Python Script:**
   Finally, you can run the Python script to list all the services that are enabled for your project. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python list_services.py
   ```

   This will print out a list of all the services that are enabled for your project, along with their current state. If a service is not needed and still enabled, it is a misconfiguration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of "Restrict Allowed Google Cloud APIs and Services" in GCP using the GCP console, please follow the below steps:

Step 1: Login to your Google Cloud Platform console.

Step 2: Select the project you want to remediate the misconfiguration for.

Step 3: Click on the Navigation menu, go to the "IAM & Admin" section, and select "IAM".

Step 4: In the IAM page, select the role for which you want to restrict the allowed APIs and services.

Step 5: Click on the "Edit" button next to the selected role.

Step 6: Scroll down to the "Permissions" section and click on the "Add Condition" button.

Step 7: In the "Add Condition" dialog box, select the "APIs & Services" option from the dropdown menu.

Step 8: In the "APIs & Services" section, select the "APIs" tab and select the APIs and services you want to allow.

Step 9: Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

Step 10: Verify that the allowed APIs and services are restricted by checking the IAM page for the role you modified.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of "Restrict Allowed Google Cloud APIs and Services" in GCP using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Restrict Allowed Google Cloud APIs and Services" misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP Console.

Step 2: Run the following command to list all the enabled APIs and services in your project:

```
gcloud services list --enabled
```

Step 3: Identify the APIs and services that are not required for your project and note down their service names. For example, if you want to restrict the Cloud SQL Admin API, note down its service name "sqladmin.googleapis.com".

Step 4: Run the following command to disable the unnecessary APIs and services:

```
gcloud services disable [SERVICE_NAME]
```

Replace [SERVICE_NAME] with the service name that you want to disable. For example, to disable the Cloud SQL Admin API, run the following command:

```
gcloud services disable sqladmin.googleapis.com
```

Step 5: Verify that the API or service has been disabled by running the following command:

```
gcloud services list --enabled

#### Using Python

To restrict allowed Google Cloud APIs and Services in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```
from googleapiclient import discovery
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

2. Set up the credentials using the service account key file:

```
creds = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/service_account_key.json')
```

3. Set up the client for the Service Usage API:

```
service = discovery.build('serviceusage', 'v1', credentials=creds)
```

4. Define the project ID and the list of APIs and Services to be restricted:

```
project_id = 'your-project-id'
restricted_services = ['storage-component.googleapis.com', 'bigquery.googleapis.com']
```

5. Get the list of enabled services for the project:

```
enabled_services = service.services().list(parent=f'projects/{project_id}/services').execute()
```

6. Disable the services that are not in the restricted list:

```
for service in enabled_services['services']:
    if service['config']['name'] not in restricted_services:
        service_name = service['config']['name']
        service_version = service['config']['title']
        print(f'Disabling service {service_name} ({service_version})...')
        service.services().disable(name=f'projects/{project_id}/services/{service_name}.{service_version}').execute()
```

7. Verify that only the restricted services are enabled:

```
enabled_services = service.services().list(parent=f'projects/{project_id}/services').execute()
for service in enabled_services['services']:
    if service['config']['name'] not in restricted_services:
        print(f'Error: Service {service["config"]["name"]} is still enabled.')
```

This Python script will restrict the allowed Google Cloud APIs and Services for the specified project.
