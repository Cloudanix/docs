### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform web console and sign in with your Google account that has the necessary permissions to view IAM policies.

2. Navigate to IAM & Admin: From the main dashboard of the Google Cloud Platform Console, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner of the screen), then scroll down and click on "IAM & Admin".

3. View IAM Policies: In the IAM & Admin page, click on "IAM" in the left-hand menu to view the IAM policies. Here, you can see all the IAM roles and the members (users, groups, or service accounts) that are assigned to each role.

4. Check Load Balancer Permissions: Look for roles that have permissions related to load balancers (e.g., "compute.loadBalancer.create", "compute.loadBalancer.list", "compute.loadBalancer.update", etc.). Check if these roles are assigned to any members that should not have the ability to create certain types of load balancers. If such misconfigurations are found, it indicates that the restriction on load balancer creation based on load balancer types is not properly configured in IAM.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK (if not already done). You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, you can initialize it using the command `gcloud init`.

2. Once the SDK is set up, you can list all the IAM policies in your project using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy [PROJECT_ID]
   ```
   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your project ID. This command will return a list of all IAM policies in your project.

3. To check the restrictions on Load Balancer creation, you need to look for the `compute.loadBalancer.create` permission in the IAM policies. You can do this by filtering the output of the previous command using the `grep` command in Unix-based systems or the `findstr` command in Windows. The command would look like this:
   ```
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy [PROJECT_ID] | grep "compute.loadBalancer.create"
   ```
   or
   ```
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy [PROJECT_ID] | findstr "compute.loadBalancer.create"
   ```
   This command will return the IAM policies that include the `compute.loadBalancer.create` permission.

4. If the `compute.loadBalancer.create` permission is present in any IAM policy, it means that the policy allows the creation of Load Balancers. If it is not present, it means that the creation of Load Balancers is restricted. You can further analyze the output to determine which types of Load Balancers are allowed or restricted based on the associated roles and members.

#### Using Python

To check the restriction of Load Balancer creation based on Load Balancer types in IAM using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Setup AWS SDK (Boto3) in Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up AWS SDK (Boto3) in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   After installing boto3, configure your AWS credentials either by setting up environment variables or by using AWS CLI. 

2. **List all IAM Policies:**
   Use the `list_policies` method from IAM client in boto3 to list all the IAM policies. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create IAM client
   iam = boto3.client('iam')

   # List policies
   response = iam.list_policies(
       Scope='All',
       OnlyAttached=False
   )

   for policy in response['Policies']:
       print(policy['PolicyName'])
   ```
   This script will list all the IAM policies.

3. **Check for Load Balancer Permissions in Policies:**
   For each policy, you need to check if it has permissions related to Load Balancer creation. You can use the `get_policy_version` method to get the policy document and then check for Load Balancer permissions. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import json

   # Get the default version of the policy
   response = iam.get_policy_version(
       PolicyArn=policy['Arn'],
       VersionId=policy['DefaultVersionId']
   )

   # Parse the policy document
   policy_document = json.loads(response['PolicyVersion']['Document'])

   # Check for Load Balancer permissions
   for statement in policy_document['Statement']:
       if 'elasticloadbalancing:CreateLoadBalancer' in statement['Action']:
           print(f"Policy {policy['PolicyName']} allows Load Balancer creation")
   ```
   This script will print the names of the policies that allow Load Balancer creation.

4. **Check for Specific Load Balancer Types:**
   If you want to restrict the creation of specific types of Load Balancers, you need to check the `Resource` field in the policy statement. For example, to restrict the creation of Application Load Balancers, you can modify the above script like this:
   ```python
   # Check for Load Balancer permissions
   for statement in policy_document['Statement']:
       if 'elasticloadbalancing:CreateLoadBalancer' in statement['Action']:
           if 'Resource' in statement and 'arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:*:*:loadbalancer/app/*' in statement['Resource']:
               print(f"Policy {policy['PolicyName']} allows Application Load Balancer creation")
   ```
   This script will print the names of the policies that allow Application Load Balancer creation.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Restrict Load Balancer Creation Based on Load Balancer Types in GCP using the GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP console and go to the "IAM & Admin" section.
2. Click on "Roles" and search for the "Compute Load Balancer Admin" role.
3. Click on the "Compute Load Balancer Admin" role and then click on the "Edit" button.
4. Scroll down to the "Permissions" section and click on the "Add Permissions" button.
5. In the search bar, type "compute.targetPools.create" and select the checkbox next to it.
6. Repeat the same process for "compute.forwardingRules.create" and "compute.globalForwardingRules.create".
7. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

By following the above steps, you have restricted the creation of load balancers based on load balancer types in GCP. Now, only users with the "Compute Load Balancer Admin" role can create load balancers.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of restricting Load Balancer creation based on Load Balancer types in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP Cloud Shell or any terminal with GCP CLI installed, and authenticate with your GCP account using the following command:
```
gcloud auth login
```

2. Set the project in which you want to remediate the misconfiguration using the following command:
```
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
```
Replace PROJECT_ID with the ID of your GCP project.

3. Run the following command to create a custom IAM role that restricts the creation of Load Balancers based on their types:
```
gcloud iam roles create RestrictLBType --project=PROJECT_ID --title="Restrict Load Balancer Creation Based on Type" --description="Restricts the creation of Load Balancers based on their types" --permissions=compute.backendBuckets.create,compute.forwardingRules.create,compute.globalForwardingRules.create,compute.targetHttpProxies.create,compute.targetHttpsProxies.create,compute.urlMaps.create,compute.targetPools.create
```

4. Run the following command to grant the custom IAM role to the users or groups that are allowed to create Load Balancers:
```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member=USER_OR_GROUP --role=projects/PROJECT_ID/roles/RestrictLBType
```
Replace USER_OR_GROUP with the email address of the user or group that is allowed to create Load Balancers.

5. Verify that the IAM policy binding has been added successfully using the following command:
```
gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID
```

With these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of restricting Load Balancer creation based on Load Balancer types in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To restrict load balancer creation based on load balancer types in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to create a GCP service account with the required permissions to manage load balancers. You can do this by following the documentation here: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts

2. Then, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK and the Python client library for GCP. You can follow the instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install and here: https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference

3. Next, you need to write a Python script that will check the load balancer type before creating a new load balancer. You can use the GCP Python client library to list the existing load balancers and check their types.

4. Here's some sample code that you can use as a starting point:

```
from google.cloud import compute_v1

# Create a client object for the Compute Engine API
client = compute_v1.LoadBalancerClient()

# Define the allowed load balancer types
allowed_types = ['INTERNAL', 'HTTP', 'HTTPS']

# List the existing load balancers
load_balancers = client.list()

# Check the type of each load balancer
for lb in load_balancers:
    if lb.load_balancer_type not in allowed_types:
        # Delete the load balancer if it's not an allowed type
        client.delete(lb.self_link)
```

5. Finally, you can schedule this script to run periodically using a cron job or a similar tool. This will ensure that any load balancers that violate your policy are automatically deleted.

Note: This is just a sample code and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements. Also, ensure that you thoroughly test the script before running it in a production environment.
