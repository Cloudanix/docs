### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of Restrict Load Balancer Creation Based on Load Balancer Types in GCP using the GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP console and go to the "IAM & Admin" section.
2. Click on "Roles" and search for the "Compute Load Balancer Admin" role.
3. Click on the "Compute Load Balancer Admin" role and then click on the "Edit" button.
4. Scroll down to the "Permissions" section and click on the "Add Permissions" button.
5. In the search bar, type "compute.targetPools.create" and select the checkbox next to it.
6. Repeat the same process for "compute.forwardingRules.create" and "compute.globalForwardingRules.create".
7. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

By following the above steps, you have restricted the creation of load balancers based on load balancer types in GCP. Now, only users with the "Compute Load Balancer Admin" role can create load balancers.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of restricting Load Balancer creation based on Load Balancer types in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP Cloud Shell or any terminal with GCP CLI installed, and authenticate with your GCP account using the following command:
```
gcloud auth login
```

2. Set the project in which you want to remediate the misconfiguration using the following command:
```
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
```
Replace PROJECT_ID with the ID of your GCP project.

3. Run the following command to create a custom IAM role that restricts the creation of Load Balancers based on their types:
```
gcloud iam roles create RestrictLBType --project=PROJECT_ID --title="Restrict Load Balancer Creation Based on Type" --description="Restricts the creation of Load Balancers based on their types" --permissions=compute.backendBuckets.create,compute.forwardingRules.create,compute.globalForwardingRules.create,compute.targetHttpProxies.create,compute.targetHttpsProxies.create,compute.urlMaps.create,compute.targetPools.create
```

4. Run the following command to grant the custom IAM role to the users or groups that are allowed to create Load Balancers:
```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member=USER_OR_GROUP --role=projects/PROJECT_ID/roles/RestrictLBType
```
Replace USER_OR_GROUP with the email address of the user or group that is allowed to create Load Balancers.

5. Verify that the IAM policy binding has been added successfully using the following command:
```
gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID
```

With these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of restricting Load Balancer creation based on Load Balancer types in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To restrict load balancer creation based on load balancer types in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to create a GCP service account with the required permissions to manage load balancers. You can do this by following the documentation here: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts

2. Then, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK and the Python client library for GCP. You can follow the instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install and here: https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference

3. Next, you need to write a Python script that will check the load balancer type before creating a new load balancer. You can use the GCP Python client library to list the existing load balancers and check their types.

4. Here's some sample code that you can use as a starting point:

```
from google.cloud import compute_v1

# Create a client object for the Compute Engine API
client = compute_v1.LoadBalancerClient()

# Define the allowed load balancer types
allowed_types = ['INTERNAL', 'HTTP', 'HTTPS']

# List the existing load balancers
load_balancers = client.list()

# Check the type of each load balancer
for lb in load_balancers:
    if lb.load_balancer_type not in allowed_types:
        # Delete the load balancer if it's not an allowed type
        client.delete(lb.self_link)
```

5. Finally, you can schedule this script to run periodically using a cron job or a similar tool. This will ensure that any load balancers that violate your policy are automatically deleted.

Note: This is just a sample code and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements. Also, ensure that you thoroughly test the script before running it in a production environment.
