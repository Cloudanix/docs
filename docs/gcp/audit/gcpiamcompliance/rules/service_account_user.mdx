<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Service Account User Should Not Have Service Account Token Creator Role" for GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to identify the service account user who has the Service Account Token Creator role. You can do this by running the following command in the Cloud Shell:

   ```
   gcloud iam service-accounts list
   ```

2. Once you have identified the service account user, you need to remove the Service Account Token Creator role from the user. You can do this by running the following command in the Cloud Shell:

   ```
   from google.oauth2 import service_account
   from googleapiclient.discovery import build

   credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path_to_service_account_key_file>')
   service = build('iam', 'v1', credentials=credentials)

   user_email = '<service_account_user_email>'
   project_id = '<project_id>'
   role_name = 'roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator'

   policy = service.projects().getIamPolicy(resource=project_id, body={}).execute()

   for binding in policy['bindings']:
       if binding['role'] == role_name and user_email in binding['members']:
           binding['members'].remove(user_email)

   service.projects().setIamPolicy(resource=project_id, body={'policy': policy}).execute()
   ```

   Note: Replace `<path_to_service_account_key_file>`, `<service_account_user_email>` and `<project_id>` with the appropriate values.

3. Once you have run the above command, verify that the Service Account Token Creator role has been removed from the service account user by running the following command in the Cloud Shell:

   ```
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy <project_id> --flatten="bindings[].members" --format='table(bindings.role)' --filter="bindings.members:<service_account_user_email>"
   ```

   This should return an empty table, indicating that the user no longer has the Service Account Token Creator role.

4. Finally, you should review your organization's IAM policies and best practices to ensure that service account users are not granted unnecessary permissions in the future.
