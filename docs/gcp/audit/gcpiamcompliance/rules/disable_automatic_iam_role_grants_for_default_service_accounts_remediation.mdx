### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser and navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com). Enter your login credentials to access your GCP account.

2. Navigate to IAM & Admin: Once you're logged in, look for the navigation menu on the top left corner of the console. Click on it and scroll down to find "IAM & Admin". Click on it to open the IAM & Admin dashboard.

3. Access IAM: In the IAM & Admin dashboard, click on "IAM" in the left-hand side menu. This will open the IAM page where you can see all the IAM roles and permissions.

4. Check Default Service Accounts: In the IAM page, look for the default service accounts. These are usually named as "Compute Engine default service account" or "App Engine default service account". Check if these accounts have any roles granted automatically. If they do, it means the Disable Automatic IAM Role Grants for Default Service Accounts is not configured properly.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Once the Google Cloud SDK is installed and configured, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to list all the service accounts in your GCP project:

   ```
   gcloud iam service-accounts list --project=[PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual GCP project ID.

3. For each service account listed, you can check the IAM policies attached to it by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] --project=[PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]` with the email of the service account and `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual GCP project ID.

4. Review the output of the above command. If the service account has the `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` role, it means that the automatic IAM role grants are not disabled for this service account. If the service account does not have this role, it means that the automatic IAM role grants are disabled.

#### Using Python

To check if Automatic IAM Role Grants are disabled for Default Service Accounts in IAM using Python scripts, you can use the Google Cloud Client Libraries. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Google Cloud Client Libraries**: If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-iam
   ```
2. **Set up authentication**: Before you can interact with GCP services, you need to authenticate your client. You can do this by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key JSON file.
   ```
   import os
   os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"]="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
   ```
3. **Initialize the IAM service client**: Now, you can initialize the IAM service client in your Python script.
   ```
   from google.cloud import iam
   client = iam.ServiceAccountClient()
   ```
4. **Check for automatic IAM role grants**: You can now use the `get_iam_policy` method to get the IAM policy for a service account, and then check if any roles have been granted to it. If any roles have been granted, it means that Automatic IAM Role Grants are not disabled.
   ```
   policy = client.get_iam_policy("projects/{project-id}/serviceAccounts/{service-account-id}")
   for binding in policy.bindings:
       if binding.role != '':
           print(f"Automatic IAM Role Grants are not disabled for service account {service-account-id}")
   ```
   Replace `{project-id}` and `{service-account-id}` with your actual project ID and service account ID.

Please note that you need appropriate permissions to view IAM policies. If you encounter any permission errors, make sure your service account has the `iam.serviceAccounts.getIamPolicy` permission.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Disable Automatic IAM Role Grants for Default Service Accounts" in GCP using GCP console, please follow the below steps:

1. Login to your GCP console.
2. Navigate to the "IAM & Admin" section from the left-hand side menu.
3. Click on the "Settings" tab.
4. Scroll down to the "Service Accounts" section.
5. In the "Service Accounts" section, you will find the option "Enable automatic role grants for default service accounts". Make sure this option is unchecked. If it is checked, click on the edit button (pencil icon) and uncheck the option.
6. Once you have unchecked the option, click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

By following the above steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Disable Automatic IAM Role Grants for Default Service Accounts" in GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of "Disable Automatic IAM Role Grants for Default Service Accounts" in GCP, you can follow the below steps using GCP CLI:

1. Open the GCP Cloud Shell or any terminal with GCP CLI installed.

2. Run the following command to list the existing default service accounts in your project:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts list
```

3. Select the default service account for which you want to disable the automatic IAM role grant. For example, if you want to disable it for the Compute Engine default service account, run the following command:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts describe <COMPUTE_ENGINE_DEFAULT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
```

Replace `<COMPUTE_ENGINE_DEFAULT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>` with the email address of the Compute Engine default service account.

4. Once you have identified the default service account, run the following command to disable the automatic IAM role grant:

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <PROJECT_ID> --member serviceAccount:<DEFAULT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL> --role roles/iam.serviceAccountUser --condition=None
```

Replace `<PROJECT_ID>` with your GCP project ID and `<DEFAULT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>` with the email address of the default service account that you want to modify.

5. Verify that the automatic IAM role grant has been disabled for the default service account by running the following command:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy <DEFAULT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
```

This should return an empty policy for the default service account, indicating that no roles are automatically granted. 

That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of "Disable Automatic IAM Role Grants for Default Service Accounts" in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Disable Automatic IAM Role Grants for Default Service Accounts" for GCP using Python, follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to create a service account for your project using the GCP console. Give it the necessary permissions to manage IAM roles.

2. Install the necessary Python libraries for GCP authentication and authorization. You can use the following command to install these libraries:

```
!pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-cloud-iam google-cloud-resource-manager
```

3. Authenticate and authorize your Python script to access your GCP project. You can use the following code snippet to do this:

```
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from google.cloud import iam

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/your/service_account.json')
client = iam.IAMClient(credentials=credentials)
```

4. List all the default service accounts in your GCP project. You can use the following code snippet to do this:

```
from google.cloud import resource_manager

project_id = 'your-project-id'
client = resource_manager.Client()
project = client.project(project_id)
service_accounts = client.list_service_accounts(project)
for account in service_accounts:
    if account.email.startswith('default'):
        print(account.email)
```

5. Disable automatic IAM role grants for each default service account. You can use the following code snippet to do this:

```
from google.api_core.exceptions import NotFound

project_id = 'your-project-id'
policy = client.get_policy(project_id)
for binding in policy.bindings:
    if binding.role == 'roles/editor':
        for member in binding.members:
            if member.startswith('serviceAccount:'):
                try:
                    client.test_iam_permissions(
                        member, ['iam.roles.delete'])
                    client.set_iam_policy(
                        member, {'bindings': []})
                except NotFound:
                    pass
```

This code snippet will remove all the IAM role grants for the default service accounts in the specified project. You can modify the code to suit your specific requirements.
