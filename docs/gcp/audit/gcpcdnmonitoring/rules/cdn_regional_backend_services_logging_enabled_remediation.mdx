### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud CDN: From the main dashboard of the Google Cloud Platform Console, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines) located at the top left corner of the page. Scroll down and click on "Network Services" and then select "Cloud CDN".

3. Check Backend Services: In the Cloud CDN page, click on the "Backend services" tab. This will display a list of all the backend services associated with your Cloud CDN.

4. Check Logging Status: For each backend service, check the "Logging" column. If logging is enabled, it will show "On". If it is not enabled, it will show "Off". This is how you can detect if Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services have logging enabled or not.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine and authenticate it. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install and initialize it.

2. List all the backend services: Use the following command to list all the backend services in your project:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all backend services along with their details.

3. Get the details of each backend service: For each backend service, use the following command to get its details:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of your backend service. This command will return the details of the specified backend service.

4. Check the logging status: In the output of the previous command, look for the `enableCDN` and `logConfig` fields. If `enableCDN` is set to `true` and `logConfig` is either not present or `enable` is set to `false`, then logging is not enabled for that backend service.

#### Using Python

To check if Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services have logging enabled in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Python scripts, you can use the Google Cloud Client Library for Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Install the Google Cloud Client Library for Python:**
   You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-logging
   ```

2. **Set up authentication:**
   Before you can interact with GCP services, you need to authenticate your client. You can do this by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key file.
   ```
   import os
   os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"]="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
   ```

3. **Initialize the Logging Client:**
   You can initialize the logging client as follows:
   ```
   from google.cloud import logging
   client = logging.Client()
   ```

4. **Check if Logging is Enabled for Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services:**
   You can check if logging is enabled for each backend service as follows:
   ```
   from google.cloud import compute_v1

   compute = compute_v1.BackendServicesClient()

   project = 'my-project'  # replace with your project ID
   for backend_service in compute.list(project=project):
       if backend_service.enable_cdn:
           if backend_service.log_config.enable:
               print(f'Logging is enabled for {backend_service.name}')
           else:
               print(f'Logging is NOT enabled for {backend_service.name}')
   ```
   This script lists all backend services in the specified project, checks if CDN is enabled for each service, and then checks if logging is enabled. If logging is enabled, it prints a message stating that logging is enabled for the service. If logging is not enabled, it prints a message stating that logging is not enabled for the service.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Should Have Logging Enabled" for GCP using the GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud CDN page.
2. Select the name of the CDN that you want to remediate.
3. In the left-hand menu, select the "Backend services" option.
4. Click on the name of the backend service that you want to remediate.
5. In the backend service page, scroll down to the "Cloud Logging" section.
6. Click on the "Add Log Sink" button.
7. In the "Create Sink" page, enter a name for the log sink.
8. In the "Sink Service" section, select "Cloud Logging".
9. In the "Sink Destination" section, select the destination where you want to send the logs.
10. In the "Filter" section, specify the filter criteria for the logs that you want to send to the destination.
11. Click on the "Create" button to create the log sink.

Once the log sink is created, all the logs generated by the backend service will be sent to the specified destination. This will remediate the misconfiguration of "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Should Have Logging Enabled" for GCP.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Should Have Logging Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud SDK Shell and connect to your GCP project using the command:

   `gcloud init`

2. Enable the Cloud CDN API using the command:

   `gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com`

3. Create a logging sink using the command:

   `gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME] --log-filter='resource.type="http_load_balancer" AND resource.labels.forwarding_rule_name="[FORWARDING_RULE_NAME]"'`

   Replace `[SINK_NAME]` with a name for your logging sink, `[BUCKET_NAME]` with the name of the GCP storage bucket where you want to store the logs, and `[FORWARDING_RULE_NAME]` with the name of the forwarding rule associated with the regional backend service.

4. Grant the `logging.logWriter` IAM role to the Cloud Logging service account using the command:

   `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member='serviceAccount:[SINK_NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com' --role='roles/logging.logWriter'`

   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your GCP project ID and `[SINK_NAME]` with the name of your logging sink.

5. Update the regional backend service to enable logging using the command:

   `gcloud compute backend-services update [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --enable-cdn-logging --cdn-logging-sink=[SINK_NAME]`

   Replace `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of the regional backend service and `[SINK_NAME]` with the name of the logging sink created in step 3.

6. Verify that logging is enabled for the regional backend service by checking the logs in the GCP storage bucket specified in step 3.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Should Have Logging Enabled" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

```
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

Step 2: Set up the authentication credentials

```
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path_to_service_account_file>')
project_id = '<your_project_id>'
```

Step 3: Create a function to enable logging for the backend service

```
def enable_backend_service_logging(service_name, backend_service_name):
    service = build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
    backend_service = service.backendServices().get(project=project_id, backendService=backend_service_name).execute()
    backend_service['logConfig'] = {
        'enable': True,
        'sampleRate': 1.0
    }
    response = service.backendServices().update(project=project_id, backendService=backend_service_name, body=backend_service).execute()
    print(f'Logging enabled for backend service {backend_service_name}')
```

Step 4: Call the function with the appropriate parameters

```
enable_backend_service_logging('compute', '<backend_service_name>')
```

Note: Replace `<path_to_service_account_file>`, `<your_project_id>`, and `<backend_service_name>` with the appropriate values.
