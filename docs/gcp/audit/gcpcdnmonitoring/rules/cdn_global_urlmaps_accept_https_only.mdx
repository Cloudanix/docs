### Check Cause
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud CDN: From the main dashboard of the Google Cloud Platform Console, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines) located at the top left corner of the page. Scroll down and click on "Network Services", then select "Cloud CDN".

3. Check Urlmaps: In the Cloud CDN page, you will see a list of your CDN resources. Click on the "Urlmaps" tab to view all the URL maps associated with your CDN resources.

4. Check Https Connections: For each URL map, check the "protocols" column. If it says "HTTP and HTTPS", it means that the URL map is accepting both HTTP and HTTPS connections. If it says "HTTPS only", it means that the URL map is correctly configured to accept HTTPS connections only.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Authenticate your CLI with your Google Cloud account by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the instructions to log in with your Google account.

3. List all the URL maps in your project by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud compute url-maps list
   ```
   This will display a list of all URL maps in your project.

4. For each URL map, check if it accepts HTTPS connections only. You can do this by running the following command for each URL map:
   ```
   gcloud compute url-maps describe [URL_MAP_NAME]
   ```
   Replace `[URL_MAP_NAME]` with the name of your URL map. This command will display the details of the URL map. If the `defaultService` field points to an HTTPS backend service, then the URL map accepts HTTPS connections only. If it points to an HTTP backend service, then it does not accept HTTPS connections only.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud CDN: Before you start, make sure you have installed Google Cloud SDK and authenticated it with your GCP account. Also, install the Python client for Google Cloud CDN using pip:

   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-cdn
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the client:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import cdn

   client = cdn.CdnServiceClient()
   ```

3. Fetch the list of URL maps: You can fetch the list of URL maps using the `list_url_maps` method. This method requires the project ID and the region as parameters. You can loop through the list of URL maps and check if they accept HTTPS connections only.

   ```python
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   region = 'your-region'

   url_maps = client.list_url_maps(project=project_id, region=region)

   for url_map in url_maps:
       print(f"URL Map: {url_map.name}, HTTPS Only: {url_map.https_redirect}")
   ```

4. Analyze the output: The script will print the name of each URL map and whether it accepts HTTPS connections only. If the `https_redirect` property is `False`, it means that the URL map accepts HTTP connections, which is a misconfiguration. You should manually check these URL maps and update their settings if necessary.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate this misconfiguration for GCP using the GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Cloud CDN page.
2. Select the Global URL Maps tab.
3. Click on the name of the URL map that you want to modify.
4. Click on the Edit button at the top of the page.
5. In the Edit URL map page, scroll down to the Host and Path Rules section.
6. Click on the Add Host and Path Rule button.
7. In the new rule, set the Host to "*" to match all hosts.
8. Set the Path to "/*" to match all paths.
9. Set the Backend service to the appropriate backend service for your application.
10. Under the Protocol section, select HTTPS from the dropdown menu.
11. Click on the Save button to save the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, your Global URL Map will only accept HTTPS connections. Any HTTP connections will be rejected.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of Cloud CDN Global Urlmaps accepting only HTTPS connections in GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project where the Cloud CDN is configured.

Step 2: Open the Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon in the top right corner of the console.

Step 3: Run the following command to list all the existing URL maps in the project:

```
gcloud compute url-maps list
```

Step 4: Identify the URL map that needs to be remediated.

Step 5: Run the following command to update the URL map to accept only HTTPS connections:

```
gcloud compute url-maps update [URL_MAP_NAME] --default-service [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --ssl-policy=global-ssl-policy
```

Replace [URL_MAP_NAME] with the name of the URL map that needs to be updated and [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] with the name of the backend service associated with the URL map.

Step 6: Verify that the URL map has been updated successfully by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute url-maps describe [URL_MAP_NAME]
```

This command should return the updated URL map configuration, which should include the "sslPolicy" field set to "global-ssl-policy".

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Cloud CDN Global Urlmaps accepting only HTTPS connections in GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Urlmaps Should Accept Https Connections Only" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the required packages:

```python
!pip install google-cloud-cdn
!pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2
```

2. Authenticate with GCP:

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from google.cloud import cdn_v1beta1

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/service_account.json')
client = cdn_v1beta1.GlobalForwardingRulesClient(credentials=credentials)
```

3. Get the list of existing global URL maps:

```python
project_id = 'your-project-id'
location = 'global'

parent = f'projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}'
url_maps = client.list_url_maps(parent=parent)
```

4. For each URL map, check if it has an HTTPS forwarding rule:

```python
for url_map in url_maps:
    https_forwarding_rule = None
    for forwarding_rule in url_map.host_rules[0].path_matchers[0].route_rules[0].forward_action.https_redirect.action:
        if forwarding_rule.https_redirect:
            https_forwarding_rule = forwarding_rule
            break
    if not https_forwarding_rule:
        print(f'URL map "{url_map.name}" does not have an HTTPS forwarding rule')
```

5. If a URL map does not have an HTTPS forwarding rule, update it:

```python
for url_map in url_maps:
    https_forwarding_rule = None
    for forwarding_rule in url_map.host_rules[0].path_matchers[0].route_rules[0].forward_action.https_redirect.action:
        if forwarding_rule.https_redirect:
            https_forwarding_rule = forwarding_rule
            break
    if not https_forwarding_rule:
        url_map.host_rules[0].path_matchers[0].route_rules[0].forward_action.https_redirect.action.append(
                cdn_v1beta1.HttpsRedirectAction())
        client.update_url_map(url_map=url_map, update_mask=['host_rules.path_matchers.route_rules.forward_action.https_redirect.action'])
        print(f'URL map "{url_map.name}" has been updated to only accept HTTPS connections')
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Urlmaps Should Accept Https Connections Only" for GCP using Python.
