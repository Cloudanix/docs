1. Sign in to Google Cloud Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google Cloud credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud CDN: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner). Scroll down and click on "Network Services", then select "Cloud CDN".

3. Check Backend Services: In the Cloud CDN page, you will see a list of your CDN configurations. Click on each of the backend services to check their details.

4. Verify Logging Status: In the backend service details page, look for the "Cloud Logging" section. If logging is enabled, you will see a green checkmark or "Enabled" status. If it's not, you will see a red cross or "Disabled" status. Repeat this process for all backend services to ensure logging is enabled for all.

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Authenticate your GCP account using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   This will open a new browser window where you can log in with your Google Cloud credentials.

3. List all the backend services in your project using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services list
   ```
   This will display a list of all backend services in your project.

4. For each backend service, check if logging is enabled using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --format="get(enableCDN)"
   ```
   Replace `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of your backend service. If the output of this command is `False`, then logging is not enabled for that backend service.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud CDN: Before you start, make sure you have installed Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud CDN on your local machine. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-sdk
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-cdn
   ```

2. Authenticate your SDK: Use the following command to authenticate your SDK:

   ```
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

3. Write a Python script to list all the backend services and check if logging is enabled:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1

   def list_backend_services():
       client = compute_v1.BackendServicesClient()
       project = 'your_project_id'  # replace with your project id

       # List all backend services
       response = client.list(project=project)

       for backend_service in response:
           print(f"Backend Service: {backend_service.name}")
           print(f"Logging Enabled: {backend_service.enable_cdn_logs}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       list_backend_services()
   ```
   This script will print the name of each backend service and whether logging is enabled for it.

4. Run the Python script: Save the script in a file, say `check_cdn_logging.py`, and run it using the following command:

   ```
   python check_cdn_logging.py
   ```
   
   This will list all the backend services in your project and whether they have logging enabled. If any of the backend services have logging disabled, you have detected a misconfiguration.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Logging Enabled" for GCP using GCP console, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project where the Cloud CDN is configured.
2. Select the "Navigation menu" on the top-left corner of the console and navigate to "Networking" -> "Cloud CDN".
3. Click on the name of the backend service that you want to remediate.
4. In the backend service details page, click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
5. Scroll down to the "Logging" section and click on the "Enable logging" checkbox.
6. Select the "Cloud Storage bucket" where you want to store the logs.
7. Choose a "Log format" from the drop-down list. You can choose either "JSON" or "Legacy".
8. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Once the changes are saved, the Cloud CDN global backend service will have logging enabled, and the logs will be stored in the specified Cloud Storage bucket.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Logging Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Cloud CDN page.

2. Select the backend service for which you want to enable logging.

3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.

4. Scroll down to the "Logging" section and click on the drop-down menu.

5. Select the desired logging destination from the available options, such as Cloud Logging or Cloud Storage.

6. If you select Cloud Storage, provide a bucket name and a prefix for the logs.

7. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

Alternatively, you can use GCP CLI to enable logging for a backend service by following the below steps:

1. Open the GCP Cloud Shell.

2. Run the following command to enable logging for a backend service:

```
gcloud compute backend-services update [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --global-log-config enable-logging --global-log-config-name [LOG_NAME] --global-log-config-sample-rate [SAMPLE_RATE]
```

Replace the `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of your backend service, `[LOG_NAME]` with the name of the log, and `[SAMPLE_RATE]` with the sample rate for the logs.

3. Press Enter to execute the command.

4. Verify the logging configuration by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --format="get(logConfig.enabled)"
```

This will return "True" if logging is enabled for the backend service.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Logging Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of Cloud CDN Global Backend Services not having logging enabled for GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to enable Cloud Logging API for your GCP project. You can do this by going to the Cloud Console and navigating to APIs & Services > Dashboard. Then click on the Enable APIs and Services button and search for "Cloud Logging API". Enable it for your project.

2. Next, you need to create a Cloud Logging sink to export the logs from Cloud CDN to Cloud Logging. You can do this using the `google-cloud-logging` Python library. Here is an example code snippet to create a sink:

```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2

client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
project_id = "your-project-id"
sink_name = "cdn-logs-sink"
destination = f"logging.googleapis.com/projects/{project_id}/logs/cdn"

parent = f"projects/{project_id}"
sink = {
    "name": sink_name,
    "destination": destination,
    "filter": "resource.type=http_load_balancer AND log_name=projects/your-project-id/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity",
}

response = client.create_sink(parent, sink)
print(f"Created sink: {response.name}")
```

Replace `your-project-id` with your actual GCP project ID. This code will create a sink named "cdn-logs-sink" that exports logs from Cloud CDN to a log named "cdn" in Cloud Logging.

3. Finally, you need to configure your Cloud CDN backend service to use the Cloud Logging sink you just created. You can do this using the `google-cloud-cdn` Python library. Here is an example code snippet to update a backend service:

```python
from google.cloud import cdn_v1beta1

client = cdn_v1beta1.BackendServicesClient()
backend_service_name = "your-backend-service-name"
project_id = "your-project-id"
log_sink = f"logging.googleapis.com/projects/{project_id}/sinks/cdn-logs-sink"

backend_service = client.get_backend_service(request={"backend_service": backend_service_name})
backend_service.log_config.enabled = True
backend_service.log_config.sink = log_sink

update_mask = {"paths": ["log_config.enabled", "log_config.sink"]}
response = client.update_backend_service(request={"backend_service": backend_service, "update_mask": update_mask})
print(f"Updated backend service: {response}")
```

Replace `your-backend-service-name` and `your-project-id` with your actual backend service name and GCP project ID. This code will enable logging for the backend service and set the log sink to the one you created earlier.

After running these steps, your Cloud CDN backend service should have logging enabled and the logs should be exported to Cloud Logging.
