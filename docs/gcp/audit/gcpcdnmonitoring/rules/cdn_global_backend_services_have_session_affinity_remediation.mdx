1. Login to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the GCP Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google Cloud credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud CDN Backend Services: From the GCP Console dashboard, select "Navigation Menu" (three horizontal lines in the upper left corner). Scroll down and click on "Network Services" and then select "Cloud CDN". 

3. Check Backend Services: In the Cloud CDN page, click on the "Backend services" tab. This will display a list of all the backend services associated with your Cloud CDN.

4. Check Session Affinity: For each backend service, click on the service name to open its details. Look for the "Session affinity" setting. If it's set to "None", then the backend service does not have session affinity enabled. Repeat this process for all backend services to check their session affinity settings.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Authenticate your GCP account using the following command. This will open a new window in your web browser asking you to log in with your Google account and allow the Google Cloud SDK to access it.
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. Set your GCP project ID to the project you want to check. Replace `your-project-id` with your actual project ID.
   ```
   gcloud config set project your-project-id
   ```

4. Run the following command to list all the backend services in your project and their session affinity settings. The `--global` flag is used to list global backend services.
   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services list --global --format="table(name,sessionAffinity)"
   ```
   This command will output a table with the names of all global backend services and their session affinity settings. If the session affinity is not set to `CLIENT_IP` or `GENERATED_COOKIE`, then the backend service does not have session affinity enabled.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Compute Engine: Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and authenticated it with your GCP account. Also, install the Python client for Google Compute Engine using pip.

```bash
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and establish a connection: Import the necessary Python libraries and establish a connection with the GCP Compute Engine service.

```python
from googleapiclient import discovery
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials

credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
service = discovery.build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

3. List all the backend services: Use the `backendServices().list()` method to get a list of all the backend services in your project.

```python
project = 'your_project_id'  # replace with your project id
request = service.backendServices().list(project=project)
```

4. Check the sessionAffinity property: For each backend service, check the `sessionAffinity` property. If it's not set to `CLIENT_IP` or `CLIENT_IP_PROTO`, then the backend service does not have session affinity enabled.

```python
while request is not None:
    response = request.execute()

    for backend_service in response['items']:
        if 'sessionAffinity' in backend_service:
            if backend_service['sessionAffinity'] not in ['CLIENT_IP', 'CLIENT_IP_PROTO']:
                print('Backend service {} does not have session affinity enabled.'.format(backend_service['name']))

    request = service.backendServices().list_next(previous_request=request, previous_response=response)
```

This script will print out the names of all backend services that do not have session affinity enabled.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Session Affinity" in GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project you want to work with.
2. Go to the Navigation menu and select "Network Services" and then select "Cloud CDN".
3. In the Cloud CDN page, select the name of the backend service that you want to remediate.
4. In the backend service page, click on the "Edit" button on the top of the page.
5. In the "Edit backend service" page, scroll down to the "Session affinity" section.
6. Select the "Client IP and protocol" option from the drop-down menu for "Session affinity".
7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

By following the above steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Session Affinity" in GCP using GCP console.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Session Affinity" for GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to list all the backend services in your project:

```
gcloud compute backend-services list
```

3. Identify the backend service(s) that are used by your Cloud CDN.

4. Run the following command to update the backend service(s) and enable session affinity:

```
gcloud compute backend-services update [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --session-affinity CLIENT_IP
```

Replace [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] with the name of the backend service you identified in step 3.

5. Verify that session affinity is enabled for the backend service(s) by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] | grep sessionAffinity
```

This command should return the following output:

```
sessionAffinity: CLIENT_IP
```

This confirms that session affinity has been enabled for the backend service(s) used by your Cloud CDN.

Note: Enabling session affinity may result in increased latency and decreased availability, depending on your workload. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the impact of this change before implementing it in a production environment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Session Affinity" for GCP using python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to authenticate with GCP using the below command:

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/your/credentials.json'
)

service = build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

2. Next, you need to get the list of all global backend services using the below command:

```python
project = 'your-project-id'
global_backend_services = service.backendServices().list(project=project).execute()
```

3. For each global backend service, you need to check if session affinity is enabled or not using the below command:

```python
for service in global_backend_services['items']:
    service_name = service['name']
    service_info = service['sessionAffinitySettings']['affinityCookieTtlSec']
    if service_info == 0:
        print(f"Session affinity is not enabled for {service_name}")
```

4. If session affinity is not enabled for any global backend service, you can enable it using the below command:

```python
for service in global_backend_services['items']:
    service_name = service['name']
    service_info = service['sessionAffinitySettings']['affinityCookieTtlSec']
    if service_info == 0:
        print(f"Enabling session affinity for {service_name}")
        body = {
            'sessionAffinitySettings': {
                'affinityType': 'GENERATED_COOKIE',
                'affinityCookieTtlSec': 3600
            }
        }
        service = service.backendServices().patch(
            project=project,
            backendService=service_name,
            body=body
        ).execute()
```

This will enable session affinity for all the global backend services which do not have it enabled.
