### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Login to Google Cloud Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google Cloud credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud CDN: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner), scroll down and click on "Network Services", then select "Cloud CDN".

3. Check Backend Services: In the Cloud CDN page, you will see a list of your CDN configurations. Click on the name of the CDN configuration you want to check. This will take you to the "Backend services" page.

4. Check Session Affinity: In the "Backend services" page, look for the "Session affinity" field. If it is set to "None", then the CDN does not have session affinity enabled. If it is set to "Client IP" or "Generated cookie", then session affinity is enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK (Software Development Kit) on your local machine. This SDK includes the GCP (Google Cloud Platform) CLI (Command Line Interface) tool `gcloud` which is used to interact with your GCP resources.

2. Once the SDK is installed and configured, open your terminal and run the following command to list all the backend services in your GCP project:

    ```
    gcloud compute backend-services list
    ```

    This command will return a list of all backend services along with their details.

3. To check the session affinity for a specific backend service, use the following command:

    ```
    gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]
    ```

    Replace `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of the backend service you want to check. This command will return the configuration details of the specified backend service.

4. In the output of the above command, look for the `sessionAffinity` field. If the value of this field is `NONE`, it means that the backend service does not have session affinity enabled. If the value is `CLIENT_IP` or `GENERATED_COOKIE`, it means that session affinity is enabled for the backend service.

#### Using Python

1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Compute Engine: Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and authenticated it with your GCP account. Also, install the Python client for Google Compute Engine using pip:

   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and establish a service client: You will need to import the `googleapiclient.discovery` library and establish a service client for Compute Engine. Here's how you can do it:

   ```python
   from googleapiclient import discovery
   import google.auth

   credentials, project = google.auth.default()
   service = discovery.build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
   ```

3. List all backend services: Now, you can list all the backend services in your project and check their session affinity settings. Here's a Python script that does this:

   ```python
   request = service.backendServices().list(project=project)
   while request is not None:
       response = request.execute()

       for backend_service in response['items']:
           print('Backend service: ' + backend_service['name'])
           print('Session affinity: ' + backend_service['sessionAffinity'])

       request = service.backendServices().list_next(previous_request=request, previous_response=response)
   ```

4. Analyze the output: The script will print the name of each backend service and its session affinity setting. If the session affinity is not set to "CLIENT_IP" or "GENERATED_COOKIE", then the backend service does not have session affinity enabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Session Affinity" in GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project you want to work with.
2. Go to the Navigation menu and select "Network Services" and then select "Cloud CDN".
3. In the Cloud CDN page, select the name of the backend service that you want to remediate.
4. In the backend service page, click on the "Edit" button on the top of the page.
5. In the "Edit backend service" page, scroll down to the "Session affinity" section.
6. Select the "Client IP and protocol" option from the drop-down menu for "Session affinity".
7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

By following the above steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Session Affinity" in GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Session Affinity" for GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to list all the backend services in your project:

```
gcloud compute backend-services list
```

3. Identify the backend service(s) that are used by your Cloud CDN.

4. Run the following command to update the backend service(s) and enable session affinity:

```
gcloud compute backend-services update [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --session-affinity CLIENT_IP
```

Replace [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] with the name of the backend service you identified in step 3.

5. Verify that session affinity is enabled for the backend service(s) by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] | grep sessionAffinity
```

This command should return the following output:

```
sessionAffinity: CLIENT_IP
```

This confirms that session affinity has been enabled for the backend service(s) used by your Cloud CDN.

Note: Enabling session affinity may result in increased latency and decreased availability, depending on your workload. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the impact of this change before implementing it in a production environment.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Session Affinity" for GCP using python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to authenticate with GCP using the below command:

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/your/credentials.json'
)

service = build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

2. Next, you need to get the list of all global backend services using the below command:

```python
project = 'your-project-id'
global_backend_services = service.backendServices().list(project=project).execute()
```

3. For each global backend service, you need to check if session affinity is enabled or not using the below command:

```python
for service in global_backend_services['items']:
    service_name = service['name']
    service_info = service['sessionAffinitySettings']['affinityCookieTtlSec']
    if service_info == 0:
        print(f"Session affinity is not enabled for {service_name}")
```

4. If session affinity is not enabled for any global backend service, you can enable it using the below command:

```python
for service in global_backend_services['items']:
    service_name = service['name']
    service_info = service['sessionAffinitySettings']['affinityCookieTtlSec']
    if service_info == 0:
        print(f"Enabling session affinity for {service_name}")
        body = {
            'sessionAffinitySettings': {
                'affinityType': 'GENERATED_COOKIE',
                'affinityCookieTtlSec': 3600
            }
        }
        service = service.backendServices().patch(
            project=project,
            backendService=service_name,
            body=body
        ).execute()
```

This will enable session affinity for all the global backend services which do not have it enabled.
