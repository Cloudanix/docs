### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform web console and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud CDN: From the main navigation menu, click on "Networking" and then select "Cloud CDN". This will take you to the Cloud CDN dashboard where you can view all your CDN configurations.

3. Check Urlmaps settings: In the Cloud CDN dashboard, locate the "Urlmaps" section. Here, you will find a list of all your Urlmaps. Click on the name of the Urlmap you want to inspect.

4. Inspect HTTPS settings: In the Urlmap details page, look for the "HTTPS settings" or "Protocol" section. If the setting is configured to accept both HTTP and HTTPS connections, then it is a misconfiguration. The Urlmap should be configured to accept HTTPS connections only for secure data transmission.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install and authenticate it with your GCP account.

2. Once the SDK is installed and configured, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to list all the URL maps in your project:

   ```
   gcloud compute url-maps list
   ```

3. For each URL map, you can check its details using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute url-maps describe [URL_MAP_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[URL_MAP_NAME]` with the name of your URL map.

4. In the output of the above command, look for the `defaultService` field. This field should point to a backend service or backend bucket that is configured to accept HTTPS connections only. If it points to a service or bucket that accepts HTTP connections, then it is a misconfiguration.

Please note that this process needs to be repeated for each URL map in your project. Also, this only checks the default service or bucket for each URL map. If your URL map has path matchers that point to other services or buckets, you need to check those as well.

#### Using Python

1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud CDN: Before you start, make sure you have installed Google Cloud SDK and authenticated it with your GCP account. Also, install the Python client for Google Cloud CDN using pip:

   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-cdn
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the client:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import cdn

   client = cdn.CdnServiceClient()
   ```

3. Fetch the list of URL maps: You can fetch the list of URL maps using the `list_url_maps` method. You need to provide the project ID and the region as parameters:

   ```python
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   region = 'your-region'

   url_maps = client.list_url_maps(project=project_id, region=region)
   ```

4. Check the protocol of each URL map: Now, iterate over the list of URL maps and check the protocol of each one. If the protocol is not HTTPS, then it is a misconfiguration:

   ```python
   for url_map in url_maps:
       if url_map.default_service.protocol != 'HTTPS':
           print(f"URL map {url_map.name} is misconfigured. It accepts HTTP connections.")
   ```

This script will print the names of all URL maps that accept HTTP connections, which is a misconfiguration according to the Cloud CDN Regional Urlmaps Should Accept Https Connections Only rule.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate this misconfiguration in GCP using GCP console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Cloud CDN page.

2. Click on the name of the CDN you want to remediate.

3. Click on the "Url maps" tab.

4. Select the URL map which you want to remediate.

5. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.

6. In the "Host and path rules" section, select the rule which you want to remediate.

7. In the "Backend service" section, click on the "Advanced" dropdown.

8. Under "Frontend protocol", select "HTTPS only".

9. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

10. Repeat steps 6-9 for all the rules in the URL map.

11. Verify that the CDN regional URL maps are now accepting HTTPS connections only by testing it.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of accepting HTTP connections in Cloud CDN regional URL maps in GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the Cloud CDN Regional Urlmaps to accept HTTPS connections only on GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to list all the existing Cloud CDN UrlMaps:

```
gcloud compute url-maps list
```

3. Identify the name of the UrlMap that needs to be updated and run the following command to describe the details of the UrlMap:

```
gcloud compute url-maps describe [URL_MAP_NAME]
```

4. Identify the name of the backend service associated with the UrlMap and run the following command to describe the details of the backend service:

```
gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]
```

5. Identify the name of the health check associated with the backend service and run the following command to describe the details of the health check:

```
gcloud compute health-checks describe [HEALTH_CHECK_NAME]
```

6. If the health check is not already configured to use HTTPS, update the health check to use HTTPS by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute health-checks update [HEALTH_CHECK_NAME] --use-https
```

7. Update the UrlMap to accept HTTPS connections only by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute url-maps update [URL_MAP_NAME] --default-service [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --ssl-policy=global-ssl-policy
```

Note: The `global-ssl-policy` is a built-in SSL policy that enforces HTTPS connections only.

8. Verify that the changes have been applied by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute url-maps describe [URL_MAP_NAME]
```

The output should show that the `sslPolicy` is set to `global-ssl-policy`.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the Cloud CDN Regional Urlmaps to accept HTTPS connections only on GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Cloud CDN Regional Urlmaps accepting only HTTPS connections in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK and authenticate to your GCP project using the command:

```
gcloud auth login
```

2. Next, you need to install the required Python libraries using the command:

```
pip install google-cloud-cdn
```

3. After that, you can use the following Python code to remediate the misconfiguration:

```python
from google.cloud import cdn_v1beta1
from google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2 import FieldMask

client = cdn_v1beta1.UrlMapsClient()

# Replace [PROJECT_ID] with your GCP project ID
project_id = '[PROJECT_ID]'

# Replace [REGION] with the region where the urlmap is located
region = '[REGION]'

# Replace [URLMAP_NAME] with the name of the urlmap
urlmap_name = '[URLMAP_NAME]'

urlmap = client.get_url_map(request={'project_id': project_id, 'region': region, 'url_map': urlmap_name})

# Update the urlmap to accept only HTTPS connections
urlmap.default_url_redirect.https_redirect = True

# Update the urlmap using the FieldMask to only modify the https_redirect field
field_mask = FieldMask(paths=['default_url_redirect.https_redirect'])
client.update_url_map(request={'url_map': urlmap, 'update_mask': field_mask})
```

4. Finally, you can run the above Python code to remediate the misconfiguration of Cloud CDN Regional Urlmaps accepting only HTTPS connections in GCP.

Note: You need to replace the placeholders [PROJECT_ID], [REGION], and [URLMAP_NAME] with your GCP project ID, the region where the urlmap is located, and the name of the urlmap, respectively.
