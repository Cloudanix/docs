To remediate the misconfiguration of "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services CDN Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project where the misconfiguration exists.
2. In the left navigation menu, click on "Network services" and then select "Cloud CDN".
3. On the Cloud CDN page, click on the "Create" button.
4. In the "Create a new Cloud CDN" page, select the backend service that you want to enable CDN for.
5. Under the "Cache Key Policy" section, select "Include Host" and "Include Protocol".
6. Under the "Backend Buckets" section, select the backend bucket that you want to use as a source for the CDN.
7. Under the "Frontend Configurations" section, select the protocol and port that you want to use for the CDN.
8. Click on the "Create" button to create the CDN.

Once the CDN is created, it will take some time to propagate across all the CDN edge locations. You can verify the status of the CDN by checking the "Status" column on the Cloud CDN page.

You can also use the GCP CLI to enable the Cloud CDN for a backend service. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Open the GCP CLI and authenticate using your credentials.

Step 2: Run the following command to enable the Cloud CDN for a backend service:

```
gcloud compute backend-services update [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --enable-cdn
```

Replace [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] with the name of your backend service.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of Cloud CDN Global Backend Services CDN not being enabled in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to enable the Cloud CDN API in your GCP project. You can do this by navigating to the Cloud Console, selecting your project, and then navigating to APIs & Services > Dashboard. From there, click on "Enable APIs and Services" and search for "Cloud CDN API". Enable the API and wait for it to be enabled.

2. Once the API is enabled, you can use the Google Cloud Client Library for Python to programmatically create a backend service with Cloud CDN enabled. Install the library by running the following command in your terminal:

```python
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-storage
```

3. Next, you need to create a backend service using the Cloud CDN API. You can use the following Python code to create a backend service:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def create_backend_service(project_id, backend_service_name):
    client = compute_v1.BackendServicesClient()
    project = f"projects/{project_id}"
    backend_service_resource = {
        "name": backend_service_name,
        "cdn_policy": {
            "cache_key_policy": {
                "include_protocol": True,
                "include_query_string": True,
                "query_string_blacklist": ["*"]
            }
        }
    }
    response = client.insert(project=project, backend_service_resource=backend_service_resource)
    print(f"Backend service created: {response}")
```

4. Finally, you can call the `create_backend_service` function with your GCP project ID and the name of your new backend service:

```python
project_id = "your-project-id"
backend_service_name = "your-backend-service-name"
create_backend_service(project_id, backend_service_name)
```

This will create a new backend service with Cloud CDN enabled, and you can use it to serve content from your GCP project.
