1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console: Open your browser, navigate to the GCP Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud CDN: From the GCP Console dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner), scroll down and click on "Network Services", then select "Cloud CDN".

3. Check Backend Services: In the Cloud CDN page, click on the "Backend services" tab. This will display a list of all your backend services.

4. Check Failover Policy: For each backend service, click on its name to view its details. In the details page, look for the "Failover policy" section. If the failover policy is not enabled, it means that the Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Failover Policy is not enabled for that particular backend service. Repeat this step for all backend services to check their failover policies.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Authenticate your GCP account using the following command. This will open a new window in your web browser asking you to log in to your Google Cloud account.
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. Set your project ID to the project you want to check. Replace 'your-project-id' with the ID of your project.
   ```
   gcloud config set project your-project-id
   ```

4. Run the following command to list all the backend services in your project and their failover policies. If the failover policy is not enabled, it means that the Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Failover Policy is not enabled.
   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services list --format="table(name, failoverPolicy)"
   ```
   This command will return a table with the names of all backend services and their failover policies. If the failover policy is not enabled for a service, it means that the Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Failover Policy is not enabled for that service.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if the Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Failover Policy is enabled in CDN using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud CDN:**
   Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud CDN. You can install the Python client using pip:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-cdn
   ```

2. **Authentication:**
   Authenticate your SDK using service account key file. You can set the environment variable 'GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS' to the path of the service account key file.
   ```python
   import os
   os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"]="/path/to/keyfile.json"
   ```

3. **List all Backend Services:**
   Use the `compute_v1.BackendServices().list()` method to list all the backend services in a project. You need to provide the project ID as a parameter.
   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1

   def list_backend_services(project_id):
       client = compute_v1.BackendServicesClient()
       response = client.list(project=project_id)
       return response
   ```

4. **Check Failover Policy:**
   Iterate over the list of backend services and check the `failoverPolicy` attribute. If the `failoverPolicy` attribute is not set or disabled, then the Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Failover Policy is not enabled.
   ```python
   def check_failover_policy(project_id):
       backend_services = list_backend_services(project_id)
       for backend_service in backend_services:
           if not backend_service.failover_policy:
               print(f"Failover Policy is not enabled for {backend_service.name}")
   ```

Please note that the above code snippets are for illustrative purposes and may need to be adjusted to fit into your specific use case or environment.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Failover Policy Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP console, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Cloud CDN page.
2. Select the CDN endpoint you want to remediate.
3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
4. Scroll down to the "Backend services" section and click on the "Edit" button next to it.
5. Click on the "Advanced" tab.
6. Under "Failover policy", select the "Enabled" option.
7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

By enabling the failover policy, the CDN endpoint will automatically switch to a backup backend service if the primary service becomes unavailable. This will ensure that your users continue to have access to your content even in the event of a backend service failure.

#
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Failover Policy Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to enable the failover policy for the regional backend services in Cloud CDN:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services update [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --failover-policy=ALL_OR_FAIL
   ```

   Replace `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of the backend service that you want to update.

3. Verify that the failover policy has been enabled by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] | grep failoverPolicy
   ```

   This command should output the failover policy for the backend service.

   Note: If the output shows that the failover policy is not enabled, you may need to wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all the regional backend services in Cloud CDN.

   Note: You can list all the regional backend services in Cloud CDN by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services list --filter="loadBalancingScheme=EXTERNAL && protocol=HTTP && backends.service=cdn-backend"
   ```

   This command lists all the regional backend services that are used by Cloud CDN. Replace `cdn-backend` with the name of the backend service that you want to filter.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Failover Policy Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Failover Policy Should Be Enabled" in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

2. Set up credentials:

```python
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/service_account.json')
```

3. Create a client object for the Cloud CDN API:

```python
cdn = build('cdn', 'v1beta2', credentials=credentials)
```

4. Get the list of existing backend services:

```python
project_id = 'your-project-id'
backend_services = cdn.projects().backendServices().list(project=project_id).execute()
```

5. For each backend service, check if the failover policy is enabled. If not, enable it:

```python
for backend_service in backend_services['items']:
    backend_service_name = backend_service['name']
    backend_service_region = backend_service['region']
    backend_service_config = cdn.projects().backendServices().get(project=project_id, backendService=backend_service_name).execute()
    if 'failoverPolicy' not in backend_service_config:
        failover_policy = {
            'disableConnectionDrainOnFailover': False,
            'dropTrafficIfUnhealthy': False,
            'failoverRatio': 0.5
        }
        cdn.projects().backendServices().patch(project=project_id, backendService=backend_service_name, body={'failoverPolicy': failover_policy}).execute()
```

6. Verify that the failover policy has been enabled for all backend services.

This code will enable the failover policy for all backend services in your GCP project. You can run this code periodically to ensure that the failover policy remains enabled for all backend services.
