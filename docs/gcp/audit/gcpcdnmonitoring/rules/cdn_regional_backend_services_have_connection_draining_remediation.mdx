1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Authenticate your GCP account using the following command. This will open a new window in your web browser asking you to log in to your Google Cloud account.
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. Set your project ID to the project you want to check. Replace 'your-project-id' with your actual project ID.
   ```
   gcloud config set project your-project-id
   ```

4. Run the following command to list all the backend services in your project and their configurations. Look for the 'connectionDraining' field in the output. If the 'drainingTimeoutSec' is set to 0, it means that connection draining is not enabled for that backend service.
   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services list --format=json | grep -B 10 -A 10 '"connectionDraining"'
   ```
   This command will list all backend services and their configurations in JSON format, then filter the output to show only the lines containing 'connectionDraining' and 10 lines before and after it.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud CDN: Before you start, make sure you have installed Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud CDN. You can install the Python Client for Google Cloud CDN using pip:

   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-cdn
   ```

2. Authenticate your SDK: Use the following command to authenticate your SDK:

   ```
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

3. Write a Python script to list all the backend services and check if connection draining is enabled:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1

   def list_backend_services():
       client = compute_v1.BackendServicesClient()
       project = '[PROJECT_ID]'  # replace with your project ID

       # List all backend services
       response = client.list(project=project)

       for backend_service in response:
           print(f"Backend Service: {backend_service.name}")
           print(f"Connection Draining Timeout: {backend_service.connection_draining.drain_timeout_sec}")
           if backend_service.connection_draining.drain_timeout_sec == 0:
               print("Misconfiguration Detected: Connection Draining is not enabled.")
           else:
               print("Connection Draining is enabled.")
           print("\n")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       list_backend_services()
   ```

   Replace '[PROJECT_ID]' with your actual project ID. This script will list all the backend services in your project and print whether connection draining is enabled or not.

4. Run the Python script: Save the script in a file, say `check_connection_draining.py`, and run it using the following command:

   ```
   python check_connection_draining.py
   ```

   This will print the status of connection draining for all the backend services in your project. If connection draining is not enabled for any backend service, it will print "Misconfiguration Detected: Connection Draining is not enabled."

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services not having connection draining on GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and go to the Cloud Shell.

2. Run the following command to list all the backend services in your project:

```
gcloud compute backend-services list
```

3. Choose the backend service that you want to update and run the following command to describe the backend service:

```
gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --region [REGION]
```

4. Check if the connection draining configuration is set for the backend service. If not, add the connection draining configuration by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute backend-services update [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --region [REGION] --connection-draining-timeout [TIMEOUT_SECONDS]
```

Replace [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] with the name of the backend service you want to update, [REGION] with the region where the backend service is located, and [TIMEOUT_SECONDS] with the number of seconds that you want to set for the connection draining timeout.

For example, to set the connection draining timeout to 60 seconds for a backend service named "my-backend-service" located in the "us-central1" region, run the following command:

```
gcloud compute backend-services update my-backend-service --region us-central1 --connection-draining-timeout 60
```

5. Verify that the connection draining configuration is set for the backend service by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --region [REGION]
```

Make sure that the "connectionDraining" field shows the correct value for the connection draining configuration.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services not having connection draining on GCP using GCP CLI.

parent = f'projects/{project_number}/locations/{location}'

backend_services = client.list_backend_services(parent=parent)
```

4. For each backend service, check if connection draining is enabled:

```
for backend_service in backend_services:
    backend_service_name = backend_service.name
    backend_service = client.get_backend_service(name=backend_service_name)
    if backend_service.connection_draining.draining_timeout_sec == 0:
        print(f'Connection draining is not enabled for backend service {backend_service_name}')
```

5. If connection draining is not enabled, update the backend service to enable it:

```
for backend_service in backend_services:
    backend_service_name = backend_service.name
    backend_service = client.get_backend_service(name=backend_service_name)
    if backend_service.connection_draining.draining_timeout_sec == 0:
        backend_service.connection_draining.draining_timeout_sec = 300
        update_mask = {'paths': ['connection_draining']}
        client.update_backend_service(backend_service=backend_service, update_mask=update_mask)
        print(f'Connection draining has been enabled for backend service {backend_service_name}')
```
