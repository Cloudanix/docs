<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Authenticate your CLI with your Google Cloud account by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to log in with your Google account.

3. List all the backend services in your project by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services list
   ```
   This will display a list of all backend services in your project.

4. For each backend service, check if the Cloud CDN is enabled by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --global
   ```
   Replace `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of your backend service. If the Cloud CDN is enabled, the `enableCDN` field in the output will be set to `true`. If it's not enabled, the field will be set to `false` or it won't be present in the output.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing your Python script, you need to install the necessary libraries. For this task, you will need the `google-cloud-storage` library. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install google-cloud-storage
```

2. Authenticate with GCP: Before you can interact with GCP resources, you need to authenticate. You can do this by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key JSON file:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
```

3. Write the Python script: Now you can write a Python script that checks whether Cloud CDN is enabled for all global backend services. Here's a basic example:

```python
from google.cloud import storage

def check_cdn_enabled():
    client = storage.Client()
    buckets = client.list_buckets()

    for bucket in buckets:
        bucket_metadata = bucket.get_bucket(bucket.name)
        if 'cdnConfig' in bucket_metadata:
            cdn_config = bucket_metadata['cdnConfig']
            if not cdn_config['enabled']:
                print(f'CDN is not enabled for bucket: {bucket.name}')
        else:
            print(f'CDN is not configured for bucket: {bucket.name}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    check_cdn_enabled()
```

This script lists all the buckets in your GCP project and checks whether Cloud CDN is enabled for each one. If Cloud CDN is not enabled or not configured for a bucket, it prints a message.

4. Run the Python script: Finally, you can run your Python script using the Python interpreter:

```bash
python check_cdn_enabled.py
```

This will print a message for each bucket where Cloud CDN is not enabled or not configured.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services CDN Should Be Enabled" in GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project where the misconfiguration exists.
2. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon in the top right corner of the console.
3. In the Cloud Shell, run the following command to enable Cloud CDN:

   ```
   gcloud services enable --project [PROJECT_ID] compute.googleapis.com
   ```

   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of your GCP project.

4. Next, create a backend service by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services create [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] \
   --global \
   --enable-cdn \
   --project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with a name for your backend service and `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of your GCP project.

5. Add the backend service to your load balancer by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services add-backend [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] \
   --balancing-mode=UTILIZATION \
   --max-utilization=0.8 \
   --capacity-scaler=1 \
   --instance-group=[INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME] \
   --instance-group-zone=[ZONE] \
   --project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of your backend service, `[INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME]` with the name of your instance group, `[ZONE]` with the zone where your instance group is located, and `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of your GCP project.

6. Finally, update your load balancer to use the backend service by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute target-http-proxies update [TARGET_PROXY_NAME] \
   --backend-service=[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] \
   --project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[TARGET_PROXY_NAME]` with the name of your target HTTP proxy and `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of your backend service.

By following these steps, you have enabled Cloud CDN and created a backend service for your GCP project, and added it to your load balancer. This will remediate the misconfiguration of "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services CDN Should Be Enabled".
