<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Should Use Secure Listeners Only" for GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.

2. Run the following command to list all the backend services in your project:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services list
   ```

3. Identify the backend service that needs to be remediated and note down its name.

4. Run the following command to update the backend service and enable secure listeners:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services update <BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME> --enable-cdn --protocol HTTPS --global
   ```

   Replace `<BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME>` with the actual name of the backend service that needs to be remediated.

5. Verify the configuration by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services describe <BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME> --global
   ```

   This command will display the details of the backend service, including the protocol and port used for the secure listener.

6. Repeat the above steps for all the backend services in your project that need to be remediated.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Should Use Secure Listeners Only" for GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Should Use Secure Listeners Only" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

2. Set up the authentication using a service account:

```
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/service_account.json')
```

3. Build the Cloud CDN API client:

```
cdn = build('cdn', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

4. Get the list of backend services using the `projects().global().backendServices().list()` method:

```
backend_services = cdn.projects().global().backendServices().list(
    project='your-project-id').execute()
```

5. Loop through each backend service and check if it has a secure listener:

```
for backend_service in backend_services['items']:
    if '443' not in backend_service['port']:
        # Update the backend service to use a secure listener
        backend_service['port'].append('443')
        cdn.projects().global().backendServices().update(
            project='your-project-id',
            backendService=backend_service['name'],
            body=backend_service).execute()
```

6. Save the changes and exit the script.

Note: This script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to modify backend services in your GCP project.
