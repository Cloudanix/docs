### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud CDN: From the main navigation menu, select "Networking" and then "Cloud CDN". This will take you to the Cloud CDN dashboard where you can view all your CDN configurations.

3. Check Backend Services: In the Cloud CDN dashboard, you will see a list of all your backend services. Click on the name of the backend service you want to check. This will open the backend service details page.

4. Check Listener Configuration: In the backend service details page, look for the "Frontend configuration" section. Here, you should see the protocol used by the service (HTTP or HTTPS). If the protocol is HTTP, then the backend service is not using secure listeners. If the protocol is HTTPS, then the backend service is using secure listeners.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions for your specific operating system.

2. Authenticate your GCP account using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the instructions and log in with your GCP account credentials.

3. List all the backend services in your project using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all backend services in your project.

4. For each backend service, check if it uses secure listeners only. You can do this by running the following command for each backend service:
   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --global
   ```
   Replace `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of your backend service. This command will return a description of the backend service, including the protocol it uses. If the protocol is not HTTPS or HTTP/2, the backend service does not use secure listeners only.

#### Using Python

1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud CDN:
   Before you start, make sure you have installed Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud CDN. You can install the Python Client for Google Cloud CDN using pip:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-cdn
   ```

2. Authenticate your SDK:
   Use the following command to authenticate your SDK:
   ```
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

3. Write a Python script to list all the backend services:
   You can use the following Python script to list all the backend services:
   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1

   def list_backend_services():
       client = compute_v1.BackendServicesClient()
       project = 'your_project_id'  # replace with your project id

       response = client.list(project=project)
       for backend_service in response:
           print(backend_service)

   list_backend_services()
   ```
   This script will list all the backend services in your project.

4. Check if the backend services are using secure listeners:
   You can modify the above script to check if the backend services are using secure listeners. The protocol should be HTTPS or HTTP/2 for secure listeners.
   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1

   def list_backend_services():
       client = compute_v1.BackendServicesClient()
       project = 'your_project_id'  # replace with your project id

       response = client.list(project=project)
       for backend_service in response:
           if backend_service.protocol not in ['HTTPS', 'HTTP2']:
               print(f"Backend service {backend_service.name} is not using secure listeners")

   list_backend_services()
   ```
   This script will print the names of the backend services that are not using secure listeners.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Should Use Secure Listeners Only" misconfiguration in GCP using the GCP console, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project in which the Cloud CDN has been configured.
2. In the left-hand side menu, click on "Cloud CDN".
3. In the Cloud CDN dashboard, click on the name of the CDN you want to modify.
4. In the CDN details page, click on the "Backend configuration" tab.
5. In the "Backend configuration" tab, click on the "Edit" button.
6. In the "Edit backend configuration" page, scroll down to the "Backend service" section.
7. In the "Backend service" section, click on the "Edit" button.
8. In the "Edit backend service" page, scroll down to the "Protocol" section.
9. In the "Protocol" section, select "HTTPS" from the drop-down list.
10. In the same section, select the "Port number" as per your requirement.
11. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.
12. Repeat steps 5-11 for all the backend services used by the CDN.

By following the above steps, you have successfully remediated the "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Should Use Secure Listeners Only" misconfiguration in GCP using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Should Use Secure Listeners Only" for GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.

2. Run the following command to list all the backend services in your project:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services list
   ```

3. Identify the backend service that needs to be remediated and note down its name.

4. Run the following command to update the backend service and enable secure listeners:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services update <BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME> --enable-cdn --protocol HTTPS --global
   ```

   Replace `<BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME>` with the actual name of the backend service that needs to be remediated.

5. Verify the configuration by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services describe <BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME> --global
   ```

   This command will display the details of the backend service, including the protocol and port used for the secure listener.

6. Repeat the above steps for all the backend services in your project that need to be remediated.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Should Use Secure Listeners Only" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Regional Backend Services Should Use Secure Listeners Only" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

2. Set up the authentication using a service account:

```
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/service_account.json')
```

3. Build the Cloud CDN API client:

```
cdn = build('cdn', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

4. Get the list of backend services using the `projects().global().backendServices().list()` method:

```
backend_services = cdn.projects().global().backendServices().list(
    project='your-project-id').execute()
```

5. Loop through each backend service and check if it has a secure listener:

```
for backend_service in backend_services['items']:
    if '443' not in backend_service['port']:
        # Update the backend service to use a secure listener
        backend_service['port'].append('443')
        cdn.projects().global().backendServices().update(
            project='your-project-id',
            backendService=backend_service['name'],
            body=backend_service).execute()
```

6. Save the changes and exit the script.

Note: This script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to modify backend services in your GCP project.
