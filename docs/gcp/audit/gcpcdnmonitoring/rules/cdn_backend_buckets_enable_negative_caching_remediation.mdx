#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Backend Buckets Should Enable Negative Caching" in GCP, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud Storage page.
2. Select the bucket that is being used as a backend bucket for Cloud CDN.
3. Click on the "Edit Bucket" button.
4. Under the "Lifecycle" tab, click on the "Add Rule" button.
5. In the "Add Lifecycle Rule" dialog box, set the following parameters:
   - Rule Name: Enable Negative Caching
   - Action: Set storage class to "Regional"
   - Frequency: Choose an appropriate frequency for your use case
   - Conditions: Add a condition that matches the objects that should be cached with negative caching. For example, you can use the "Age" condition and set it to "is greater than" with a value of "0".
6. Click on the "Save" button to add the lifecycle rule to the bucket.
7. Verify that the lifecycle rule was added by checking the "Lifecycle" tab of the bucket.

Alternatively, you can use the GCP CLI to add the lifecycle rule to the bucket. Here's an example command:

```
gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
```

Where "lifecycle.json" is a JSON file that contains the lifecycle rule definition, and "[BUCKET_NAME]" is the name of the bucket being used as a backend bucket for Cloud CDN. Here's an example JSON file:

```
{
  "lifecycle": {
    "rule": [
      {
        "action": {"type": "SetStorageClass", "storageClass": "REGIONAL"},
        "condition": {"age": 0, "matchesStorageClass": ["REGIONAL"]},
        "description": "Enable negative caching for Cloud CDN"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This JSON file sets the storage class to "Regional" for objects that match the condition "age is greater than 0" and "matchesStorageClass is REGIONAL". The "description" field is optional and can be used to provide additional information about the rule.
