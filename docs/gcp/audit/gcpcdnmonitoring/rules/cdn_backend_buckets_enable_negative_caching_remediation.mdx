1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform web console and sign in with your Google account that has the necessary permissions to access and manage your GCP resources.

2. Navigate to Cloud CDN: From the main navigation menu, select "Networking" and then select "Cloud CDN". This will take you to the Cloud CDN page where you can see all your CDN resources.

3. Check Backend Services: On the Cloud CDN page, you will see a list of all your backend services. Click on the name of the backend service you want to check. This will take you to the backend service details page.

4. Check Negative Caching: On the backend service details page, look for the "Negative caching" setting. If this setting is enabled, it means that the backend service is configured to cache negative responses from the backend, which can improve performance and reduce load on your backend servers. If this setting is not enabled, it means that the backend service is not configured to cache negative responses, which could potentially lead to performance issues and increased load on your backend servers.

1. Install and authenticate the Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the Google Cloud CLI, you need to install it on your local machine and authenticate it with your Google Cloud account. You can download the SDK from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, you can authenticate it by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   This command will open a new window in your web browser asking you to log in with your Google account. Once logged in, the CLI will be authenticated and ready to use.

2. List all the backend buckets: The next step is to list all the backend buckets in your project. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-buckets list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the backend buckets in your project, along with some basic information about each one.

3. Get the details of each backend bucket: To check if negative caching is enabled for a backend bucket, you need to get the details of that bucket. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-buckets describe [BUCKET_NAME]
   ```
   Replace [BUCKET_NAME] with the name of the bucket you want to check. This command will return a detailed description of the bucket, including its caching policy.

4. Check the caching policy: In the output of the previous command, look for the "enableNegativeCaching" field. If this field is set to "true", then negative caching is enabled for the bucket. If it is set to "false" or if the field is not present, then negative caching is not enabled.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if Cloud CDN Backend Buckets have enabled Negative Caching in CDN using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Setup Google Cloud SDK and Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up the Google Cloud SDK and Python environment. You can download and install the Google Cloud SDK from the official Google Cloud website. After that, you can set up the Python environment by installing the necessary libraries using pip. The main library you need is `google-cloud-storage`.

   ```python
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-storage
   ```

2. **Authenticate your SDK:**
   Use the `gcloud auth application-default login` command to authenticate your SDK. This command will open a new browser for you to log in. After logging in, your SDK will be authenticated.

3. **List all the Backend Buckets:**
   Use the `google.cloud.storage.Client` class to create a client object. Then, use the `list_buckets` method of the client object to list all the backend buckets.

   ```python
   from google.cloud import storage

   def list_buckets():
       storage_client = storage.Client()
       buckets = storage_client.list_buckets()

       for bucket in buckets:
           print(bucket.name)
   ```

4. **Check the Negative Caching Policy:**
   For each backend bucket, use the `get_bucket` method of the client object to get the bucket object. Then, use the `iam_policy` property of the bucket object to get the IAM policy. Check the `negativeCachingPolicy` field of the IAM policy. If the `negativeCachingPolicy` field is not set or set to false, then the backend bucket does not enable negative caching.

   ```python
   def check_negative_caching(bucket_name):
       storage_client = storage.Client()
       bucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)
       iam_policy = bucket.iam_policy

       if 'negativeCachingPolicy' not in iam_policy or not iam_policy['negativeCachingPolicy']:
           print(f'Bucket {bucket_name} does not enable negative caching.')
   ```

Please note that the above scripts are simplified and may need to be adjusted based on your specific requirements and environment.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Backend Buckets Should Enable Negative Caching" for GCP using GCP Console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and go to the Cloud Storage Browser page.

2. Select the bucket that you want to configure for negative caching.

3. Click on the "Edit bucket permissions" button.

4. In the "Add members" field, enter "allUsers" and select the "Storage Object Viewer" role.

5. Click on the "Add" button to save the changes.

6. Go to the Cloud CDN page in the GCP Console.

7. Select the CDN resource that is associated with the backend bucket.

8. Click on the "Edit" button.

9. In the "Backend configuration" section, click on the "Advanced" tab.

10. Check the "Enable negative caching" checkbox.

11. Set the "Negative caching TTL" value to the desired time in seconds.

12. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

13. Verify that the negative caching is enabled by sending a request to the CDN resource and checking the response headers.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Backend Buckets Should Enable Negative Caching" for GCP using GCP Console.

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Backend Buckets Should Enable Negative Caching" in GCP, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud Storage page.
2. Select the bucket that is being used as a backend bucket for Cloud CDN.
3. Click on the "Edit Bucket" button.
4. Under the "Lifecycle" tab, click on the "Add Rule" button.
5. In the "Add Lifecycle Rule" dialog box, set the following parameters:
   - Rule Name: Enable Negative Caching
   - Action: Set storage class to "Regional"
   - Frequency: Choose an appropriate frequency for your use case
   - Conditions: Add a condition that matches the objects that should be cached with negative caching. For example, you can use the "Age" condition and set it to "is greater than" with a value of "0".
6. Click on the "Save" button to add the lifecycle rule to the bucket.
7. Verify that the lifecycle rule was added by checking the "Lifecycle" tab of the bucket.

Alternatively, you can use the GCP CLI to add the lifecycle rule to the bucket. Here's an example command:

```
gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
```

Where "lifecycle.json" is a JSON file that contains the lifecycle rule definition, and "[BUCKET_NAME]" is the name of the bucket being used as a backend bucket for Cloud CDN. Here's an example JSON file:

```
{
  "lifecycle": {
    "rule": [
      {
        "action": {"type": "SetStorageClass", "storageClass": "REGIONAL"},
        "condition": {"age": 0, "matchesStorageClass": ["REGIONAL"]},
        "description": "Enable negative caching for Cloud CDN"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This JSON file sets the storage class to "Regional" for objects that match the condition "age is greater than 0" and "matchesStorageClass is REGIONAL". The "description" field is optional and can be used to provide additional information about the rule.
