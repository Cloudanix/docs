### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform web console and sign in with your Google account that has the necessary permissions to access and manage your GCP resources.

2. Navigate to Cloud CDN: From the main navigation menu, click on "Networking" and then select "Cloud CDN". This will take you to the Cloud CDN page where you can see all your CDN resources.

3. Check Backend Services: On the Cloud CDN page, you will see a list of all your backend services. Click on the name of the backend service that you want to check. This will take you to the backend service details page.

4. Check Negative Caching: On the backend service details page, look for the "Negative caching" option. If this option is enabled, you will see a check mark next to it. If it is not enabled, there will be no check mark. This is how you can check if Cloud CDN Backend Buckets have enabled Negative Caching in CDN using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Authenticate your GCP account using the following command. This will open a new window in your web browser asking you to log in with your Google account and allow the Google Cloud SDK to access it.
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
3. List all the backend buckets in your project using the following command. Replace `PROJECT_ID` with your actual project ID.
   ```
   gcloud compute backend-buckets list --project=PROJECT_ID
   ```
4. For each backend bucket, check the negative caching policy using the following command. Replace `BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME` with the name of each backend bucket.
   ```
   gcloud compute backend-buckets describe BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME --project=PROJECT_ID
   ```
   If the `enableNegativeCaching` field is set to `false` or is not present, then negative caching is not enabled for that backend bucket.

#### Using Python

To check if Cloud CDN Backend Buckets have enabled Negative Caching in CDN using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Setup Google Cloud SDK and Python Environment:**
   First, you need to set up the Google Cloud SDK and Python environment. You can download and install the Google Cloud SDK from the official website. After that, you can set up the Python environment by installing the necessary libraries using pip. The main library you need is `google-cloud-storage`.

   ```python
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-storage
   ```

2. **Authenticate and Initialize the Cloud Storage Client:**
   You need to authenticate your SDK using the service account key file. You can download this file from the IAM section of the Google Cloud Console. After that, you can initialize the Cloud Storage client in your Python script.

   ```python
   from google.cloud import storage
   storage_client = storage.Client.from_service_account_json('path_to_your_service_account_file.json')
   ```

3. **List All Backend Buckets and Check Negative Caching:**
   You can list all the backend buckets in your project and check if they have enabled negative caching. You can do this by calling the `list_buckets` method on the storage client and checking the `enableNegativeCaching` property of each bucket.

   ```python
   for bucket in storage_client.list_buckets():
       bucket_metadata = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket.name).get_blob(bucket.name)
       if not bucket_metadata.enableNegativeCaching:
           print(f'Bucket {bucket.name} does not have negative caching enabled.')
   ```

4. **Run the Python Script:**
   Finally, you can run the Python script. If there are any backend buckets that do not have negative caching enabled, they will be printed out.

Please note that the above script is a basic example and might need to be adjusted based on your specific requirements and environment.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Backend Buckets Should Enable Negative Caching" for GCP using GCP Console, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and go to the Cloud Storage Browser page.

2. Select the bucket that you want to configure for negative caching.

3. Click on the "Edit bucket permissions" button.

4. In the "Add members" field, enter "allUsers" and select the "Storage Object Viewer" role.

5. Click on the "Add" button to save the changes.

6. Go to the Cloud CDN page in the GCP Console.

7. Select the CDN resource that is associated with the backend bucket.

8. Click on the "Edit" button.

9. In the "Backend configuration" section, click on the "Advanced" tab.

10. Check the "Enable negative caching" checkbox.

11. Set the "Negative caching TTL" value to the desired time in seconds.

12. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

13. Verify that the negative caching is enabled by sending a request to the CDN resource and checking the response headers.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Backend Buckets Should Enable Negative Caching" for GCP using GCP Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Backend Buckets Should Enable Negative Caching" in GCP, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud Storage page.
2. Select the bucket that is being used as a backend bucket for Cloud CDN.
3. Click on the "Edit Bucket" button.
4. Under the "Lifecycle" tab, click on the "Add Rule" button.
5. In the "Add Lifecycle Rule" dialog box, set the following parameters:
   - Rule Name: Enable Negative Caching
   - Action: Set storage class to "Regional"
   - Frequency: Choose an appropriate frequency for your use case
   - Conditions: Add a condition that matches the objects that should be cached with negative caching. For example, you can use the "Age" condition and set it to "is greater than" with a value of "0".
6. Click on the "Save" button to add the lifecycle rule to the bucket.
7. Verify that the lifecycle rule was added by checking the "Lifecycle" tab of the bucket.

Alternatively, you can use the GCP CLI to add the lifecycle rule to the bucket. Here's an example command:

```
gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
```

Where "lifecycle.json" is a JSON file that contains the lifecycle rule definition, and "[BUCKET_NAME]" is the name of the bucket being used as a backend bucket for Cloud CDN. Here's an example JSON file:

```
{
  "lifecycle": {
    "rule": [
      {
        "action": {"type": "SetStorageClass", "storageClass": "REGIONAL"},
        "condition": {"age": 0, "matchesStorageClass": ["REGIONAL"]},
        "description": "Enable negative caching for Cloud CDN"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This JSON file sets the storage class to "Regional" for objects that match the condition "age is greater than 0" and "matchesStorageClass is REGIONAL". The "description" field is optional and can be used to provide additional information about the rule.
