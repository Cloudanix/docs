<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services CDN Should Be Enabled" in GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project where the misconfiguration exists.
2. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon in the top right corner of the console.
3. In the Cloud Shell, run the following command to enable Cloud CDN:

   ```
   gcloud services enable --project [PROJECT_ID] compute.googleapis.com
   ```

   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of your GCP project.

4. Next, create a backend service by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services create [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] \
   --global \
   --enable-cdn \
   --project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with a name for your backend service and `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of your GCP project.

5. Add the backend service to your load balancer by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services add-backend [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] \
   --balancing-mode=UTILIZATION \
   --max-utilization=0.8 \
   --capacity-scaler=1 \
   --instance-group=[INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME] \
   --instance-group-zone=[ZONE] \
   --project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of your backend service, `[INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME]` with the name of your instance group, `[ZONE]` with the zone where your instance group is located, and `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of your GCP project.

6. Finally, update your load balancer to use the backend service by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute target-http-proxies update [TARGET_PROXY_NAME] \
   --backend-service=[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] \
   --project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[TARGET_PROXY_NAME]` with the name of your target HTTP proxy and `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of your backend service.

By following these steps, you have enabled Cloud CDN and created a backend service for your GCP project, and added it to your load balancer. This will remediate the misconfiguration of "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services CDN Should Be Enabled".

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of Cloud CDN Global Backend Services CDN should be enabled in GCP using python, follow these steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```python
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

2. Set up the credentials and define the project ID:

```python
creds = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/service_account.json'
)

project_id = 'your-project-id'
```

3. Create a client object for the Compute Engine API:

```python
compute = build('compute', 'v1', credentials=creds)
```

4. Define the name of the backend service and the URL map:

```python
backend_service_name = 'your-backend-service-name'
url_map_name = 'your-url-map-name'
```

5. Get the current configuration of the backend service:

```python
backend_service = compute.backendServices().get(
    project=project_id,
    backendService=backend_service_name
).execute()
```

6. Check if Cloud CDN is already enabled for the backend service:

```python
if 'cdnPolicy' in backend_service and backend_service['cdnPolicy']['cacheKeyPolicy']['includeProtocol'] == True:
    print('Cloud CDN is already enabled for the backend service.')
    exit()
```

7. If Cloud CDN is not enabled, enable it by updating the backend service:

```python
backend_service['cdnPolicy'] = {
    'cacheKeyPolicy': {
        'includeProtocol': True
    }
}

compute.backendServices().update(
    project=project_id,
    backendService=backend_service_name,
    body=backend_service
).execute()

print('Cloud CDN has been enabled for the backend service.')
```

8. Finally, update the URL map to use the backend service:

```python
url_map = compute.urlMaps().get(
    project=project_id,
    urlMap=url_map_name
).execute()

url_map['defaultService'] = f'/compute/v1/projects/{project_id}/global/backendServices/{backend_service_name}'

compute.urlMaps().update(
    project=project_id,
    urlMap=url_map_name,
    body=url_map
).execute()

print(f'The URL map {url_map_name} has been updated to use the backend service {backend_service_name}.')
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Cloud CDN Global Backend Services CDN should be enabled in GCP using python.
