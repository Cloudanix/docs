<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Use Secure Listeners Only" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project where the misconfiguration exists.

2. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon located at the top right corner of the console.

3. In the Cloud Shell, run the following command to list all the global backend services:

```
gcloud compute backend-services list
```

4. Identify the global backend service that needs to be remediated and note its name.

5. Run the following command to update the global backend service to use secure listeners only:

```
gcloud compute backend-services update <BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME> --global --enable-cdn-ssl
```

Replace `<BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME>` with the name of the global backend service identified in step 4.

6. Verify that the global backend service has been updated to use secure listeners only by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute backend-services describe <BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME> --global
```

This command will display the details of the global backend service, including its configuration.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 for all the global backend services that need to be remediated.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Use Secure Listeners Only" for GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Use Secure Listeners Only" for GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from googleapiclient import discovery
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials
```

2. Authenticate and create a client object:

```python
credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
service = discovery.build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

3. Get the list of backend services:

```python
project = 'your-project-id'
zone = 'your-zone'
request = service.backendServices().list(project=project, zone=zone)
response = request.execute()
backend_services = response['items']
```

4. Iterate through the list of backend services and update the backend service to use secure listeners only:

```python
for backend_service in backend_services:
    backend_service_name = backend_service['name']
    backend_service_url_map = backend_service['backends'][0]['group']
    request = service.backendServices().get(project=project, backendService=backend_service_name, zone=zone)
    response = request.execute()
    backend_service = response
    if 'sslSettings' not in backend_service:
        backend_service['sslSettings'] = {}
    backend_service['sslSettings']['sslCertificates'] = []
    backend_service['sslSettings']['customCertificateHeaders'] = []
    backend_service['sslSettings']['backendServiceProtocol'] = 'HTTPS'
    request = service.backendServices().update(project=project, backendService=backend_service_name, body=backend_service, zone=zone)
    response = request.execute()
    print(f"Backend service {backend_service_name} updated to use secure listeners only.")
```

This code will update all the backend services in the specified project and zone to use secure listeners only.
