### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud CDN: From the main navigation menu, select "Networking" and then "Cloud CDN". This will take you to the Cloud CDN dashboard where you can view all your CDN configurations.

3. Check Backend Services: In the Cloud CDN dashboard, you will see a list of all your backend services. Click on the name of each backend service to view its details.

4. Verify Logging Status: In the backend service details page, look for the "Logging" section. If logging is enabled, you will see a status of "On". If it is not enabled, the status will be "Off". Repeat this process for each backend service to ensure that logging is enabled for all of them.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided by Google Cloud at https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install.

2. Once the SDK is installed and configured, open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the following command to list all the backend services in your project:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services list
   ```

4. For each backend service, run the following command to check if logging is enabled:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --global
   ```

   Replace `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of your backend service. This command will output the configuration of the backend service. Look for the `enableCDN` and `logConfig` fields in the output. If `enableCDN` is set to `true` and `logConfig` is not present or `enable` is set to `false`, then logging is not enabled for that backend service.

#### Using Python

1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud CDN: Before you start, make sure you have installed Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud CDN. You can install the Python client using pip:
   
   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-cdn
   ```

2. Authenticate with Google Cloud: Use the `gcloud auth application-default login` command to get your application default credentials. The command will open your web browser for you to log in using your Google account.

3. Use the Python Client to List Backend Services: You can use the Python client to list all backend services and check if they have logging enabled. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1

   def list_backend_services():
       client = compute_v1.BackendServicesClient()
       project = 'my-project'  # replace with your project ID

       # List all backend services
       for backend_service in client.list(project=project):
           print(f"Backend service: {backend_service.name}")
           print(f"Logging enabled: {backend_service.enable_cdn}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       list_backend_services()
   ```
   This script will print the name of each backend service and whether it has CDN enabled. Note that this script assumes that you have set your project ID in the `project` variable.

4. Analyze the Output: The script will print whether each backend service has CDN enabled. If the script prints `False` for any backend service, it means that the backend service does not have logging enabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Logging Enabled" for GCP using GCP console, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project where the Cloud CDN is configured.
2. Select the "Navigation menu" on the top-left corner of the console and navigate to "Networking" -> "Cloud CDN".
3. Click on the name of the backend service that you want to remediate.
4. In the backend service details page, click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
5. Scroll down to the "Logging" section and click on the "Enable logging" checkbox.
6. Select the "Cloud Storage bucket" where you want to store the logs.
7. Choose a "Log format" from the drop-down list. You can choose either "JSON" or "Legacy".
8. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Once the changes are saved, the Cloud CDN global backend service will have logging enabled, and the logs will be stored in the specified Cloud Storage bucket.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Logging Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Cloud CDN page.

2. Select the backend service for which you want to enable logging.

3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.

4. Scroll down to the "Logging" section and click on the drop-down menu.

5. Select the desired logging destination from the available options, such as Cloud Logging or Cloud Storage.

6. If you select Cloud Storage, provide a bucket name and a prefix for the logs.

7. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

Alternatively, you can use GCP CLI to enable logging for a backend service by following the below steps:

1. Open the GCP Cloud Shell.

2. Run the following command to enable logging for a backend service:

```
gcloud compute backend-services update [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --global-log-config enable-logging --global-log-config-name [LOG_NAME] --global-log-config-sample-rate [SAMPLE_RATE]
```

Replace the `[BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of your backend service, `[LOG_NAME]` with the name of the log, and `[SAMPLE_RATE]` with the sample rate for the logs.

3. Press Enter to execute the command.

4. Verify the logging configuration by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --format="get(logConfig.enabled)"
```

This will return "True" if logging is enabled for the backend service.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Logging Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Cloud CDN Global Backend Services not having logging enabled for GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to enable Cloud Logging API for your GCP project. You can do this by going to the Cloud Console and navigating to APIs & Services > Dashboard. Then click on the Enable APIs and Services button and search for "Cloud Logging API". Enable it for your project.

2. Next, you need to create a Cloud Logging sink to export the logs from Cloud CDN to Cloud Logging. You can do this using the `google-cloud-logging` Python library. Here is an example code snippet to create a sink:

```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2

client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
project_id = "your-project-id"
sink_name = "cdn-logs-sink"
destination = f"logging.googleapis.com/projects/{project_id}/logs/cdn"

parent = f"projects/{project_id}"
sink = {
    "name": sink_name,
    "destination": destination,
    "filter": "resource.type=http_load_balancer AND log_name=projects/your-project-id/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity",
}

response = client.create_sink(parent, sink)
print(f"Created sink: {response.name}")
```

Replace `your-project-id` with your actual GCP project ID. This code will create a sink named "cdn-logs-sink" that exports logs from Cloud CDN to a log named "cdn" in Cloud Logging.

3. Finally, you need to configure your Cloud CDN backend service to use the Cloud Logging sink you just created. You can do this using the `google-cloud-cdn` Python library. Here is an example code snippet to update a backend service:

```python
from google.cloud import cdn_v1beta1

client = cdn_v1beta1.BackendServicesClient()
backend_service_name = "your-backend-service-name"
project_id = "your-project-id"
log_sink = f"logging.googleapis.com/projects/{project_id}/sinks/cdn-logs-sink"

backend_service = client.get_backend_service(request={"backend_service": backend_service_name})
backend_service.log_config.enabled = True
backend_service.log_config.sink = log_sink

update_mask = {"paths": ["log_config.enabled", "log_config.sink"]}
response = client.update_backend_service(request={"backend_service": backend_service, "update_mask": update_mask})
print(f"Updated backend service: {response}")
```

Replace `your-backend-service-name` and `your-project-id` with your actual backend service name and GCP project ID. This code will enable logging for the backend service and set the log sink to the one you created earlier.

After running these steps, your Cloud CDN backend service should have logging enabled and the logs should be exported to Cloud Logging.
