<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Connection Draining" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.
2. Run the following command to list all the backend services in your GCP project:
```
gcloud compute backend-services list
```
3. Identify the global backend service that you want to remediate.
4. Run the following command to enable connection draining for the identified global backend service:
```
gcloud compute backend-services update [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] --connection-draining-timeout [TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS]
```
Replace [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] with the name of the identified global backend service, and [TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS] with the desired connection draining timeout in seconds. For example:
```
gcloud compute backend-services update my-global-backend-service --connection-draining-timeout 300
```
This command will enable connection draining for the identified global backend service with a timeout of 300 seconds (5 minutes).
5. Verify that the connection draining configuration has been applied by running the following command:
```
gcloud compute backend-services describe [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] | grep connectionDraining
```
Replace [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] with the name of the identified global backend service. This command should return the connection draining configuration for the identified global backend service.

With these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Global Backend Services Should Have Connection Draining" for GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of Cloud CDN Global Backend Services not having connection draining in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
from googleapiclient import discovery
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials
```

2. Set up authentication:

```
credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
service = discovery.build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

3. Define the project ID, region, and backend service name:

```
project = 'your-project-id'
region = 'your-region'
backend_service_name = 'your-backend-service-name'
```

4. Get the current backend service configuration:

```
backend_service = service.backendServices().get(project=project, backendService=backend_service_name).execute()
```

5. Check if connection draining is enabled:

```
if 'connectionDraining' not in backend_service:
    backend_service['connectionDraining'] = {}
if 'enabled' not in backend_service['connectionDraining'] or not backend_service['connectionDraining']['enabled']:
    backend_service['connectionDraining']['enabled'] = True
```

6. Update the backend service configuration:

```
request = service.backendServices().update(project=project, backendService=backend_service_name, body=backend_service)
response = request.execute()
```

7. Verify that connection draining is enabled:

```
if 'connectionDraining' in response and 'enabled' in response['connectionDraining'] and response['connectionDraining']['enabled']:
    print('Connection draining is now enabled for the backend service.')
else:
    print('Failed to enable connection draining for the backend service.')
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of Cloud CDN Global Backend Services not having connection draining in GCP using Python.
