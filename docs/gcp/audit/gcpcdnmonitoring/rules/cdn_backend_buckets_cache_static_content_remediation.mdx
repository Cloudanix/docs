<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Backend Buckets Should Cache Only Static Content" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Install the required Python libraries

```python
!pip install google-cloud-storage google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2
```

Step 2: Authenticate to GCP

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/service_account.json')
```

Step 3: Import the required libraries

```python
from google.cloud import storage
```

Step 4: Create a function to check if an object in the bucket is static or not

```python
def is_static_object(bucket_name, object_name):
    """Check if an object in the bucket is static or not"""
    static_extensions = ['.html', '.css', '.js', '.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif', '.bmp', '.ico', '.pdf', '.svg', '.woff', '.woff2', '.ttf', '.eot', '.json']
    extension = object_name.split('.')[-1]
    if extension in static_extensions:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Step 5: Create a function to update the bucket's default cache control policy

```python
def update_cache_control_policy(bucket_name):
    """Update the bucket's default cache control policy"""
    storage_client = storage.Client(credentials=credentials)
    bucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)
    bucket.default_object_acl.loaded = False
    bucket.default_object_acl.save()
    for blob in bucket.list_blobs():
        if is_static_object(bucket_name, blob.name):
            blob.cache_control = 'public, max-age=31536000'
        else:
            blob.cache_control = 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate'
        blob.patch()
```

Step 6: Call the function to update the cache control policy for the bucket

```python
update_cache_control_policy('your-bucket-name')
```

Note: Replace 'your-bucket-name' with the name of your GCP bucket.
