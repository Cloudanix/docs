1. Login to Google Cloud Console: First, you need to log in to your Google Cloud Console. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access and manage Cloud CDN and backend services.

2. Navigation to Cloud CDN: Once you are logged in, navigate to the "Networking" section in the left-hand side menu. Under "Networking", click on "Network Services" and then select "Cloud CDN".

3. Check Backend Services: In the Cloud CDN page, you will see a list of all your CDN configurations. Click on each of the backend services/buckets to check their configurations.

4. Verify Cache Settings: In the backend service/bucket configuration, look for the "Cache modes" setting. If it is set to "Cache static content only", then the backend bucket is correctly configured to cache only static content. If it is set to "Cache all content", then it is a misconfiguration as it allows caching of dynamic content as well.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install and authenticate it.

2. Once the Google Cloud SDK is installed and configured, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to list all the backend buckets in your Google Cloud CDN:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-buckets list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all backend buckets in your Google Cloud CDN.

3. To check the caching policy of a specific backend bucket, use the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-buckets describe [BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME]
   ```
   Replace `[BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME]` with the name of the backend bucket you want to check. This command will return the configuration of the specified backend bucket, including its caching policy.

4. In the output of the previous command, look for the `enableCdn` and `cdnPolicy` fields. If `enableCdn` is set to `true` and the `cacheMode` under `cdnPolicy` is not set to `CACHE_ALL_STATIC`, then the backend bucket is not configured to cache only static content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To check if Cloud CDN Backend Buckets are configured to cache only static content, you can use the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) or Google Cloud Client Libraries for Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client Libraries:**
   Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and Google Cloud Client Libraries for Python on your machine. You can install these using pip (Python package installer).

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-sdk
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-storage
   ```

2. **Authenticate and Set Project:**
   Authenticate your SDK using the command `gcloud auth login` and set your project using `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`.

3. **Python Script to List Backend Buckets:**
   Use the following Python script to list all the backend buckets in your project.

   ```python
   from google.cloud import storage

   def list_buckets():
       storage_client = storage.Client()
       buckets = storage_client.list_buckets()

       for bucket in buckets:
           print(bucket.name)

   list_buckets()
   ```

4. **Python Script to Check Cache Settings:**
   Now, for each bucket, you need to check the cache settings. You can do this by examining the `cacheControl` property of each object in the bucket. If this property is set to `no-store`, `no-cache`, or `private`, then the object is not cached.

   ```python
   from google.cloud import storage

   def check_cache_settings(bucket_name):
       storage_client = storage.Client()
       bucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)

       for blob in bucket.list_blobs():
           cache_control = blob.cache_control
           if cache_control in ['no-store', 'no-cache', 'private']:
               print(f'Object {blob.name} in bucket {bucket_name} is not cached.')

   # Replace 'your-bucket-name' with the name of your bucket
   check_cache_settings('your-bucket-name')
   ```

   Run this script for each bucket in your project. If the script prints out any objects, then those objects are not cached, and the backend bucket is not configured to cache only static content.

Remember to replace `'your-bucket-name'` with the name of your bucket. Also, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to list and view the properties of the buckets and objects in your project.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the issue of Cloud CDN Backend Buckets caching only static content in GCP using GCP Console:

1. Open the GCP Console and navigate to the Cloud Storage section.
2. Click on the checkbox next to the name of the bucket that you want to configure.
3. Click on the "Edit bucket permissions" button at the top of the page.
4. Under the "Bucket Policy Only" section, click on the "Add members" button.
5. In the "New members" field, enter the email address of the service account that you want to use for your Cloud CDN backend bucket.
6. In the "Select a role" drop-down menu, select "Storage Object Viewer".
7. Click on the "Add" button to add the service account to the bucket's IAM policy.
8. Navigate to the Cloud CDN section of the GCP Console.
9. Click on the checkbox next to the name of the Cloud CDN backend bucket that you want to configure.
10. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
11. Under the "Cache settings" section, select the "Cache everything" option.
12. Under the "Cache control" section, select the "Override" option.
13. Under the "Static content caching" section, select the "Custom" option.
14. In the "Static content caching" field, enter the file extensions for the static content that you want to cache (e.g., .html, .css, .js, .jpg, .png).
15. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

After following these steps, your Cloud CDN backend bucket will cache only static content as required.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Backend Buckets Should Cache Only Static Content" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Install the required Python libraries

```python
!pip install google-cloud-storage google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2
```

Step 2: Authenticate to GCP

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/service_account.json')
```

Step 3: Import the required libraries

```python
from google.cloud import storage
```

Step 4: Create a function to check if an object in the bucket is static or not

```python
def is_static_object(bucket_name, object_name):
    """Check if an object in the bucket is static or not"""
    static_extensions = ['.html', '.css', '.js', '.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif', '.bmp', '.ico', '.pdf', '.svg', '.woff', '.woff2', '.ttf', '.eot', '.json']
    extension = object_name.split('.')[-1]
    if extension in static_extensions:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Step 5: Create a function to update the bucket's default cache control policy

```python
def update_cache_control_policy(bucket_name):
    """Update the bucket's default cache control policy"""
    storage_client = storage.Client(credentials=credentials)
    bucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)
    bucket.default_object_acl.loaded = False
    bucket.default_object_acl.save()
    for blob in bucket.list_blobs():
        if is_static_object(bucket_name, blob.name):
            blob.cache_control = 'public, max-age=31536000'
        else:
            blob.cache_control = 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate'
        blob.patch()
```

Step 6: Call the function to update the cache control policy for the bucket

```python
update_cache_control_policy('your-bucket-name')
```

Note: Replace 'your-bucket-name' with the name of your GCP bucket.
