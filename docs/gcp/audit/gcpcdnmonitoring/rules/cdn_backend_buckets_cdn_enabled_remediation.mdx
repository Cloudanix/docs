### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud Storage: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner), scroll down and click on "Storage" under the "Storage" section. This will take you to the "Browser" page where you can see all your Cloud Storage buckets.

3. Check Backend Buckets: From the list of buckets, click on the name of the bucket that you want to check. This will take you to the bucket details page. 

4. Check CDN Configuration: On the bucket details page, click on the "Edit" button next to "Cloud CDN". If the "Enable Cloud CDN" checkbox is not checked, then Cloud CDN is not enabled for this backend bucket.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Authenticate your GCP account using the following command. This will open a new window in your web browser asking you to log in to your Google Cloud account.
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. Set your project ID to the project you want to check. Replace 'your-project-id' with the ID of your project.
   ```
   gcloud config set project your-project-id
   ```

4. Run the following command to list all the backend buckets and their details. Look for the 'enableCdn' field in the output. If it's set to 'false', then CDN is not enabled for that backend bucket.
   ```
   gcloud compute backend-buckets describe your-backend-bucket-name
   ```
   Replace 'your-backend-bucket-name' with the name of your backend bucket. Repeat this step for each backend bucket you want to check.

#### Using Python

To check if Cloud CDN Backend Buckets CDN is enabled in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Python scripts, you can use the Google Cloud Client Library for Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Install the Google Cloud Client Library for Python:**
   You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-storage
   ```
2. **Set up authentication:**
   Before you can interact with GCP, you need to authenticate with the service. You can do this by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key file.
   ```
   import os
   os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"]="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
   ```
3. **Initialize the Storage Client:**
   Once you've authenticated, you can initialize the storage client.
   ```
   from google.cloud import storage
   client = storage.Client()
   ```
4. **Check if CDN is enabled:**
   You can check if CDN is enabled for each backend bucket by calling the `get_bucket` method on the client and then checking the `bucket.cors` property. If it's empty, then CDN is not enabled.
   ```
   def check_cdn(bucket_name):
       bucket = client.get_bucket(bucket_name)
       if not bucket.cors:
           print(f'CDN is not enabled for {bucket_name}')
       else:
           print(f'CDN is enabled for {bucket_name}')

   check_cdn('your-bucket-name')
   ```
   This script will print whether CDN is enabled or not for the specified bucket. You can modify it to check multiple buckets or to return a value instead of printing.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Backend Buckets CDN Should Be Enabled" in GCP, you can follow the below steps using GCP Console:

1. Open the GCP Console and navigate to the Cloud Storage page.
2. Click on the name of the bucket that you want to enable for Cloud CDN.
3. Click on the "Edit bucket details" button at the top of the page.
4. Scroll down to the "Cloud CDN" section and click on the "Enable Cloud CDN" checkbox.
5. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page to save the changes.

Once you have enabled Cloud CDN for the backend bucket, you can verify the configuration by checking the Cloud CDN page in the GCP Console. The backend bucket should now be listed as a resource in the Cloud CDN page.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Backend Buckets CDN Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.
2. Run the following command to enable the Cloud CDN API:

   ```
   gcloud services enable cdn.googleapis.com
   ```

3. Run the following command to create a Cloud Storage bucket:

   ```
   gsutil mb -c standard -l <location> gs://<bucket-name>
   ```
   Replace `<location>` with the location where you want to create the bucket (e.g. us-central1) and `<bucket-name>` with the name of your bucket.

4. Run the following command to enable the Cloud CDN for the bucket:

   ```
   gsutil web set -m index.html -e 404.html gs://<bucket-name>
   ```

   This command sets up the bucket as a static website and enables the Cloud CDN for it.

5. Verify that the Cloud CDN is enabled for the bucket by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute backend-buckets describe <backend-bucket-name>
   ```

   Replace `<backend-bucket-name>` with the name of your backend bucket. Look for the `cdnPolicy` field in the output. It should show `"cacheMode": "CACHE_ALL_STATIC"` which confirms that the Cloud CDN is enabled for the bucket.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for each backend bucket that needs the Cloud CDN enabled.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Backend Buckets CDN Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cloud CDN Backend Buckets CDN Should Be Enabled" in GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1
from google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2 import FieldMask
```

2. Set up the GCP credentials:

```python
# Replace [PATH_TO_YOUR_CREDENTIALS_JSON] with the path to your GCP credentials JSON file.
import os
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "[PATH_TO_YOUR_CREDENTIALS_JSON]"
```

3. Initialize the Compute Engine client:

```python
client = compute_v1.ComputeClient()
```

4. Get the current configuration of the backend bucket:

```python
# Replace [BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME] with the name of the backend bucket.
backend_bucket_name = "[BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME]"
backend_bucket = client.backend_buckets.get(project="[PROJECT_ID]", backend_bucket=backend_bucket_name)
```

5. Update the configuration to enable CDN:

```python
# Set the CDN configuration.
backend_bucket.cdn_policy.cache_key_policy.include_host = True
backend_bucket.cdn_policy.cache_mode = compute_v1.BackendBucketCdnPolicy.CacheMode.CACHE_ALL_STATIC
backend_bucket.cdn_policy.signed_url_key_names.append("my-key-name")

# Update the backend bucket.
update_mask = FieldMask(paths=["cdn_policy"])
updated_backend_bucket = client.backend_buckets.update(project="[PROJECT_ID]", backend_bucket=backend_bucket_name, backend_bucket_resource=backend_bucket, update_mask=update_mask)
```

6. Verify that CDN is enabled:

```python
print(updated_backend_bucket.cdn_policy.cache_mode)
```

This should output "CACHE_ALL_STATIC", indicating that CDN is enabled for the backend bucket.

Note: You will need to replace [PROJECT_ID], [BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME], and "my-key-name" with the appropriate values for your GCP project and backend bucket.
