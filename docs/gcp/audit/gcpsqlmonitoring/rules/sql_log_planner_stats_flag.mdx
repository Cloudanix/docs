### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform web console and sign in with your Google account that has the necessary permissions to access the database services.

2. Navigate to SQL Instances: From the navigation menu, select "SQL" under the "Storage" section. This will display a list of all SQL instances in your project.

3. Select the PostgreSQL Instance: Click on the name of the PostgreSQL instance you want to check. This will open the instance details page.

4. Check the Log Planner Stats Flag: In the instance details page, navigate to the "Flags" section. Look for the "log_planner_stats" flag. If this flag is set to "on", it indicates that the PostgreSQL Log Planner Stats Flag is not off, which is a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, authenticate your Google Cloud account by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. After successful authentication, you need to list all the SQL instances in your GCP project. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all SQL instances along with their details.

3. Now, for each SQL instance, you need to check the configuration of the PostgreSQL Log Planner Stats flag. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of your SQL instance. This command will return the configuration of the SQL instance in a JSON format.

4. In the output of the above command, look for the `databaseFlags` field. This field contains a list of all the flags and their values for the SQL instance. Check the value of the `log_planner_stats` flag. If the value is 'on', then the PostgreSQL Log Planner Stats flag is not off, indicating a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

To check if the PostgreSQL Log Planner Stats flag is off in SQL using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to PostgreSQL Database:**
   First, you need to connect to your PostgreSQL database. You can use the `psycopg2` library in Python to do this. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import psycopg2

   try:
       connection = psycopg2.connect(user="sysadmin",
                                     password="pynative@#29",
                                     host="127.0.0.1",
                                     port="5432",
                                     database="postgres_db")

       cursor = connection.cursor()
       # Print PostgreSQL Connection properties
       print(connection.get_dsn_parameters(), "\n")

   except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
       print("Error while connecting to PostgreSQL", error)
   ```

2. **Execute SQL Query:**
   After successfully connecting to the database, you can execute an SQL query to check the status of the Log Planner Stats flag. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   try:
       cursor.execute("SHOW log_planner_stats;")
       record = cursor.fetchone()
       print("You are connected to - ", record, "\n")

   except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
       print("Error while connecting to PostgreSQL", error)
   ```

3. **Check the Status:**
   The `SHOW log_planner_stats;` command will return the current setting of the Log Planner Stats flag. If it is 'on', then it means that the flag is enabled. If it is 'off', then it means that the flag is disabled.

4. **Close the Connection:**
   After checking the status, don't forget to close the connection to the database. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   finally:
       # closing database connection.
       if connection:
           cursor.close()
           connection.close()
           print("PostgreSQL connection is closed")
   ```

Remember to replace the `user`, `password`, `host`, `port`, and `database` in the connection script with your actual PostgreSQL database details.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the PostgreSQL Log Planner Stats Flag misconfiguration for GCP using GCP console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to your GCP console.
2. Navigate to the Cloud SQL instances page.
3. Select the instance that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the Edit button at the top of the page.
5. Scroll down to the Flags section and click on the Add flag button.
6. In the Flag name field, enter "log_planner_stats" (without quotes).
7. In the Flag value field, enter "off" (without quotes).
8. Click on the Save button at the bottom of the page to save the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, the PostgreSQL Log Planner Stats flag will be set to off, and the misconfiguration will be remediated.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the PostgreSQL Log Planner Stats Flag misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.
2. Run the following command to list all the instances in your project:

   `gcloud sql instances list`

3. Identify the instance for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration and note down its instance name.
4. Run the following command to get the current value of the PostgreSQL log_planner_stats flag:

   `gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME] --format="value(settings.postgresql.log_planner_stats)"`

   Replace [INSTANCE_NAME] with the name of your instance.

5. If the output of the above command is "on", then run the following command to turn off the PostgreSQL log_planner_stats flag:

   `gcloud sql instances patch [INSTANCE_NAME] --database-flags log_planner_stats=off`

   Replace [INSTANCE_NAME] with the name of your instance.

6. Verify the PostgreSQL log_planner_stats flag has been turned off by running the following command:

   `gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME] --format="value(settings.postgresql.log_planner_stats)"`

   Replace [INSTANCE_NAME] with the name of your instance.

7. Ensure that the PostgreSQL log_planner_stats flag is turned off for all the instances in your project to avoid any further misconfiguration.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the PostgreSQL Log Planner Stats Flag misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "PostgreSQL Log Planner Stats Flag Should Be Off" misconfiguration for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Import the required libraries

```
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

Step 2: Set up the authentication credentials

```
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/credentials.json')
```

Step 3: Create a BigQuery client object

```
client = bigquery.Client(project='project_id', credentials=credentials)
```

Step 4: Run the following query to check the current value of the `log_planner_stats` flag:

```
query = """
SELECT name, setting
FROM pg_settings
WHERE name = 'log_planner_stats'
"""
query_job = client.query(query)
results = query_job.result()
for row in results:
    print("{}: {}".format(row.name, row.setting))
```

Step 5: If the value of `log_planner_stats` is `on`, run the following query to turn it off:

```
update_query = """
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_planner_stats = off
"""
update_job = client.query(update_query)
update_job.result()
```

Note: This query will update the configuration file for PostgreSQL, but it will not take effect until the database is restarted.

Step 6: Verify that the `log_planner_stats` flag is now set to `off` by running the query in Step 4 again.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the "PostgreSQL Log Planner Stats Flag Should Be Off" misconfiguration for GCP using Python.
