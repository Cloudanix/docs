### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to SQL Instances: From the left-hand side menu, select "SQL" under the "Storage" section. This will display a list of all SQL instances in your project.

3. Check SSL Certificate Details: Click on the name of the SQL instance you want to check. In the instance details page, click on the "Connections" tab. Here, you can see the details of the SSL certificate including its expiration date.

4. Calculate Certificate Age: Compare the expiration date of the SSL certificate with the current date to determine the age of the certificate. If the certificate is older than 90 days, it indicates that the SSL certificate has not been rotated as per the recommended practice.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions for your specific operating system. Once installed, authenticate it using the command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   This will open a new browser window where you can log in with your Google Cloud credentials.

2. List all the SQL instances in your project using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud sql instances list
   ```
   This will display a list of all SQL instances in your project, including their names, regions, and other details.

3. For each SQL instance, get the details of the SSL certificates using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud sql ssl-certs list --instance=INSTANCE_NAME
   ```
   Replace `INSTANCE_NAME` with the name of your SQL instance. This will display a list of all SSL certificates for the specified SQL instance, including their common names, SHA-1 fingerprints, expiration dates, and other details.

4. Check the 'expirationTime' field for each SSL certificate. If the certificate is more than 90 days old, it should be rotated. You can do this manually by comparing the current date with the expiration date, or you can use a script to automate the process. For example, in Python, you could use the `datetime` module to calculate the difference between the current date and the expiration date.

#### Using Python

1. Import the necessary libraries: You will need the 'pyodbc' library to connect to the SQL database, and 'ssl' library to handle SSL certificates. If not already installed, you can install them using pip.

```python
import pyodbc
import ssl
```

2. Connect to the SQL database: Use the 'pyodbc' library to establish a connection to your SQL database. Replace 'DRIVER', 'SERVER', 'DATABASE', 'USERNAME', and 'PASSWORD' with your actual SQL server details.

```python
conn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};SERVER=server_name;DATABASE=db_name;UID=user_name;PWD=password')
```

3. Fetch the SSL certificate: Use the 'ssl' library to fetch the SSL certificate from the SQL server. The 'get_server_certificate' function returns the certificate for the specified server and port as a PEM-encoded string.

```python
cert = ssl.get_server_certificate(('www.example.com', 443))
```

4. Check the certificate's expiry date: The 'load_certificate' function from the 'OpenSSL.crypto' module can be used to load the certificate and then retrieve the expiry date. If the difference between the current date and the expiry date is less than or equal to 90 days, then the certificate is due for rotation.

```python
from OpenSSL import crypto
x509 = crypto.load_certificate(crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, cert)
expiry_date = x509.get_notAfter()
current_date = datetime.datetime.now()
days_to_expiry = (expiry_date - current_date).days
if days_to_expiry <= 90:
    print("SSL Certificate should be rotated")
else:
    print("SSL Certificate is valid")
```

Please note that this is a basic script and might need to be adjusted based on the specific configuration of your SQL server and SSL certificate.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not rotating the SSL certificate for a database in GCP after every 90 days, you can follow these steps using the GCP console:

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console and select the project that contains the database that needs to be remediated.

2. Navigate to the Cloud SQL instances page and select the instance that needs to be remediated.

3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page to edit the instance settings.

4. Scroll down to the "SSL" section and click on "Change" next to "Server Certificate".

5. Select the option to "Create a new certificate" and enter the required information, such as the certificate name and the certificate expiration date.

6. Click on "Create" to generate the new SSL certificate.

7. Once the new certificate is created, click on "Save" to save the changes to the database instance.

8. Finally, set up a reminder or schedule to rotate the SSL certificate every 90 days to ensure that the certificate is always up-to-date.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not rotating the SSL certificate for a database in GCP after every 90 days.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of database SSL certificate rotation for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to list all the available instances:
```
gcloud sql instances list
```

3. Select the instance for which you want to rotate the SSL certificate and run the following command:
```
gcloud sql instances patch [INSTANCE_NAME] --database-flags ssl-cert-validity-period=90
```

4. Replace [INSTANCE_NAME] with the name of your instance.

5. This command sets the validity period of the SSL certificate to 90 days. You can change the value as per your requirement.

6. Once the command is executed successfully, the SSL certificate for the selected instance will be rotated every 90 days.

Note: Make sure that you have the necessary permissions to execute the above commands. Also, ensure that you have installed and configured the GCP CLI on your system.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of rotating the database SSL certificate after every 90 days in GCP using Python, follow the steps below:

1. First, you need to create a Cloud Function in GCP to rotate the SSL certificate. To create a Cloud Function, follow the instructions given in the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/quickstart-console).

2. After creating the Cloud Function, you need to write a Python script that will rotate the SSL certificate. Here is an example script:

```python
import google.auth
from google.cloud import spanner_v1
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def rotate_ssl_certificate(request):
    # Authenticate with GCP
    credentials, project_id = google.auth.default()
    
    # Set the instance ID and database ID
    instance_id = 'your-instance-id'
    database_id = 'your-database-id'
    
    # Create a Spanner client
    spanner_client = spanner_v1.Client(project=project_id, credentials=credentials)
    
    # Get the instance and database objects
    instance = spanner_client.instance(instance_id)
    database = instance.database(database_id)
    
    # Get the current SSL certificate expiration date
    current_cert = database.get_iam_policy().bindings[0].condition.time
        
    # Calculate the new expiration date (90 days from now)
    new_cert = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=90)
    
    # Update the SSL certificate
    database.update_ddl([f"ALTER DATABASE `{database_id}` SET OPTIONS (ssl_cert_expiration='{new_cert.isoformat()}')"])
    
    # Return a success message
    return f"SSL certificate updated. New expiration date: {new_cert.isoformat()}"
```

3. In the above script, replace `your-instance-id` and `your-database-id` with the actual IDs of your Spanner instance and database.

4. Deploy the Cloud Function by clicking on the "Deploy" button in the Cloud Function console.

5. Finally, you need to schedule the Cloud Function to run every 90 days. To do this, go to the Cloud Scheduler console and create a new job. Set the frequency to "every 90 days" and the target to the Cloud Function you just created.

After completing these steps, your SSL certificate will be rotated every 90 days automatically.
