### More Info:

Ensures SQL instances root user cannot be accessed from any host. Root access for SQL instance should only be allowed from whitelisted IPs to ensure secure access only from trusted entities.

### Risk Level

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Root User Should Not Be Accessible From Any Host" for GCP using GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Login to the GCP console at https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Navigate to the IAM & Admin section on the left-hand side of the console.
3. Click on the "IAM" tab.
4. Search for the "root" user in the list of IAM users.
5. Click on the edit icon (pencil) next to the root user.
6. In the "Add a member" field, enter the email address of the user you want to grant root user access to.
7. Select the "Project" role from the dropdown menu.
8. Click the "Save" button.

Once you have completed these steps, the root user will no longer be accessible from any host. Only the new user that you granted root user access to will be able to access the root user privileges.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Root User Should Not Be Accessible From Any Host" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the GCP project where the misconfiguration exists.

2. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon in the top right corner of the console.

3. Run the following command to list all the users in the project:

```
gcloud iam users list
```

4. Identify the root user in the list. The root user will have the email address format `username@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

5. Run the following command to remove the root user's access from all hosts:

```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create deny-root-access --direction=INGRESS --priority=1000 --action=DENY --rules=all --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags=root-access
```

6. Run the following command to create a new firewall rule that allows access to all users except the root user:

```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-all-except-root --direction=INGRESS --priority=1000 --action=ALLOW --rules=all --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags=allow-all
```

7. Run the following command to add the `root-access` tag to the root user's account:

```
gcloud compute instances add-tags <instance-name> --tags=root-access
```

Replace `<instance-name>` with the name of the instance where the root user has access.

8. Run the following command to remove the `root-access` tag from all other instances:

```
gcloud compute instances remove-tags <instance-name> --tags=root-access
```

9. Verify that the root user no longer has access to any instances in the project.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Root User Should Not Be Accessible From Any Host" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Root User Should Not Be Accessible From Any Host" in GCP using python, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to authenticate to GCP using a service account key file. You can create a service account and download the key file from the GCP console.

Here's an example code snippet to authenticate using a service account key file:

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account

# Path to the service account key file
KEY_FILE_LOCATION = '/path/to/key/file.json'

# Authenticate using the key file
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(KEY_FILE_LOCATION)
```

2. Next, you need to use the `google-cloud-iam` library to list all the IAM policies for your GCP project.

Here's an example code snippet to list all the IAM policies:

```python
from google.cloud import iam_v1

# Create a IAM client object
client = iam_v1.IAMClient(credentials=credentials)

# The resource name of the project to list the IAM policies
resource_name = 'projects/my-project-id'

# List all the IAM policies for the project
response = client.list_iam_policies(request={'resource': resource_name})

# Print the IAM policies
for policy in response:
    print(policy)
```

3. Once you have the IAM policies, you need to find the policy that grants the `roles/owner` role to the `user:root` member.

Here's an example code snippet to find the policy that grants the `roles/owner` role to the `user:root` member:

```python
# Find the policy that grants the roles/owner role to the user:root member
for policy in response:
    for binding in policy.bindings:
        if binding.role == 'roles/owner' and 'user:root' in binding.members:
            print('Found policy: {}'.format(policy))
```

4. Finally, you need to remove the `user:root` member from the policy that grants the `roles/owner` role.

Here's an example code snippet to remove the `user:root` member from the policy that grants the `roles/owner` role:

```python
from google.iam.v1.iam_policy_pb2 import Policy

# Get the policy that grants the roles/owner role to the user:root member
policy_to_update = None
for policy in response:
    for binding in policy.bindings:
        if binding.role == 'roles/owner' and 'user:root' in binding.members:
            policy_to_update = policy
            break

# Remove the user:root member from the policy
policy_to_update.bindings = [binding for binding in policy_to_update.bindings if 'user:root' not in binding.members]

# Update the policy
update_request = {
    'policy': policy_to_update,
    'update_mask': {'paths': ['bindings']}
}
client.set_iam_policy(request={'resource': resource_name, 'policy': update_request})
```

Note: This code snippet is just an example and may need to be modified depending on your specific use case. Please refer to the GCP documentation for more information on how to use the `google-cloud-iam` library.
