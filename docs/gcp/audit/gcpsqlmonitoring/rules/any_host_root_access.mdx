### Remediation

How to disable root user access from any host?

#### Using GCP Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console using your GCP account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Cloud SQL section by selecting "SQL" from the main menu.
3. Select the SQL instance for which you want to remediate the root user's accessibility.
4. In the instance details page, click on the "Users" tab.
5. Locate the root user in the user list and click on its name to access the user details.
6. In the user details page, click on the "Edit" button.
7. Scroll down to the "Host" section to modify the host-based authentication settings.
8. By default, the root user's host field may be set to `%`, which allows access from any host. Change this value to a specific host or IP address that you want to allow access from.
   - For example, you can specify `localhost` to only allow access from the local machine, or specify the IP address of a specific host that requires access.
9. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes to the root user's host-based authentication settings.
10. Review the user details to ensure that the root user's host field is set to the desired host or IP address.
11. Test the accessibility of the root user from other hosts to confirm that it is now restricted as intended.
12. Repeat these steps for any other SQL instances that have the same issue.
