### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to SQL Instances: From the left-hand side menu, select "SQL" under the "Storage" section. This will display a list of all SQL instances in your GCP account.

3. Select the SQL Instance: Click on the name of the SQL instance you want to check the backup configuration for. This will open the instance details page.

4. Check Backup Configuration: On the instance details page, scroll down to the "Backups" section. Here, you can see whether automated backups are enabled or disabled for the SQL instance. If the "Automated backups" toggle is set to "ON", then backups are enabled. If it's set to "OFF", then backups are not enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website. After downloading, install it and authenticate it with your Google Cloud account.

2. List all SQL instances: Use the following command to list all SQL instances in your project:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all SQL instances in your project, along with their details such as instance name, region, tier, and status.

3. Describe SQL instance: To check the backup configuration of a specific SQL instance, use the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of your SQL instance. This command will return a detailed description of the SQL instance, including its backup configuration.

4. Check backup configuration: In the output of the previous command, look for the `backupConfiguration` field. This field contains the backup configuration of the SQL instance. If the `enabled` field under `backupConfiguration` is set to `true`, then backup is enabled for the SQL instance. If it's set to `false`, then backup is not enabled.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. For AWS, you would need boto3, for Azure, you would need azure-mgmt-sql, and for GCP, you would need google-cloud-sql. You can install these libraries using pip.

```python
pip install boto3 azure-mgmt-sql google-cloud-sql
```

2. Connect to the cloud service: The next step is to connect to the cloud service. You would need to authenticate your script with the cloud service. This is usually done by providing your access key and secret key (for AWS), or your tenant ID, client ID, client secret, and subscription ID (for Azure), or your project ID, service account email, and JSON key file (for GCP).

```python
# For AWS
import boto3
client = boto3.client(
    'rds',
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)

# For Azure
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials
from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient

credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
    client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    secret='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
    tenant='YOUR_TENANT_ID'
)
client = SqlManagementClient(credentials, 'YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID')

# For GCP
from google.cloud import sql
client = sql.SqlAdmin('v1beta4', 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID', 'YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL', 'YOUR_JSON_KEY_FILE')
```

3. Check the backup configuration: Now that you are connected to the cloud service, you can check the backup configuration of your SQL databases. This is done by listing all your SQL instances and checking their backup configuration.

```python
# For AWS
response = client.describe_db_instances()
for instance in response['DBInstances']:
    if instance['BackupRetentionPeriod'] == 0:
        print(f"Backup is not enabled for {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']}")

# For Azure
for server in client.servers.list():
    for database in client.databases.list(server.name):
        if not database.backup_long_term_retention_policies.state:
            print(f"Backup is not enabled for {database.name}")

# For GCP
for instance in client.instances().list(project='YOUR_PROJECT_ID').execute()['items']:
    if not instance['settings']['backupConfiguration']['enabled']:
        print(f"Backup is not enabled for {instance['name']}")
```

4. Handle exceptions: It's always a good practice to handle exceptions in your script. This way, if something goes wrong, your script can fail gracefully instead of crashing.

```python
try:
    # Your code here
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

Remember to replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID', 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET', 'YOUR_TENANT_ID', 'YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID', 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID', 'YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL', and 'YOUR_JSON_KEY_FILE' with your actual credentials.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "SQL Backup Configuration Should Be Enabled" in GCP using the GCP console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Cloud SQL Instances page.

2. Select the instance for which you want to enable SQL backup configuration.

3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.

4. In the "Backup" section, select the "Enable automatic backups" checkbox.

5. Choose the backup start time and frequency as per your requirement.

6. You can also configure the retention period for backups and specify the storage location for backups.

7. Click on "Save" to save the changes.

8. Once the backup configuration is enabled, you can verify it by navigating to the "Backups" tab on the Cloud SQL instance page.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "SQL Backup Configuration Should Be Enabled" in GCP using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the SQL Backup Configuration Should Be Enabled misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP Console.
2. Run the following command to list all the SQL instances in your GCP project:

```
gcloud sql instances list
```

3. Identify the SQL instance that you want to enable backup configuration for and note down its instance name.
4. Run the following command to enable backup configuration for the identified SQL instance:

```
gcloud sql instances patch [INSTANCE_NAME] --backup-start-time [BACKUP_START_TIME]
```

Replace [INSTANCE_NAME] with the name of your SQL instance and [BACKUP_START_TIME] with the time of day you want to start the backup, in the format HH:MM in the UTC timezone. For example, if you want to start the backup at 2:00 AM UTC, the command would be:

```
gcloud sql instances patch [INSTANCE_NAME] --backup-start-time 02:00
```

5. Verify that the backup configuration has been enabled by running the following command:

```
gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME] | grep backupConfiguration
```

This command should return output similar to the following:

```
backupConfiguration:
  binaryLogEnabled: true
  enabled: true
  startTime: 02:00
```

If the output shows that backupConfiguration is enabled with the desired start time, then the remediation is successful.

Note: Enabling backup configuration may incur additional costs. Please refer to the GCP pricing documentation for more information.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "SQL Backup Configuration Should Be Enabled" in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
from googleapiclient import discovery
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials
```

2. Set up the credentials:

```
credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
service = discovery.build('sqladmin', 'v1beta4', credentials=credentials)
```

3. Get the list of instances:

```
project_id = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
instances = service.instances().list(project=project_id).execute()
```

4. Loop through each instance and check if the backup configuration is enabled:

```
for instance in instances['items']:
    instance_name = instance['name']
    backup_configuration = instance['settings']['backupConfiguration']
    if backup_configuration['enabled'] == False:
        # Enable the backup configuration
        backup_configuration['enabled'] = True
        request = service.instances().updateBackupConfiguration(project=project_id, instance=instance_name, body=backup_configuration)
        response = request.execute()
        print('Backup configuration enabled for instance: {}'.format(instance_name))
    else:
        print('Backup configuration already enabled for instance: {}'.format(instance_name))
```

5. Run the script to enable the backup configuration for all the instances in the project.

Note: Make sure to replace "YOUR_PROJECT_ID" with your actual project ID. Also, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify the SQL instances in your GCP project.
