### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your preferred web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform web console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account that has the necessary permissions to access GCP resources.

2. Navigate to SQL Instances: From the GCP Console dashboard, select the hamburger menu in the upper left-hand corner, scroll down and click on "SQL" under the "Storage" section. This will take you to the SQL instances page where you can see all your SQL instances.

3. Select the SQL Instance: From the list of SQL instances, click on the name of the instance that you want to check for automated backups. This will take you to the instance details page.

4. Check Backup Configuration: On the instance details page, scroll down to the "Backups" section. Here, you can see the backup configuration for the selected SQL instance. If the "Automated backups" option is enabled, it means that automated backups are configured for this instance. If not, then automated backups are not enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Authenticate your CLI with your Google Cloud account. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the instructions and log in with your Google Cloud account.

3. Set your active project to the project where your SQL instances are located. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```
   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of your project.

4. Run the following command to list all SQL instances in your project and check if automated backups are enabled:
   ```
   gcloud sql instances list --format="table[box](name,settings.backupConfiguration.enabled)"
   ```
   This command will output a table with the names of your SQL instances and whether automated backups are enabled (`True`) or not (`False`). If you see `False` for any of your instances, it means that automated backups are not enabled for that instance.

#### Using Python

1. AWS:
   - Install boto3, the AWS SDK for Python, and set up authentication.
   - Use the `describe_db_instances` function to get a list of all RDS instances.
   - For each instance, check the `BackupRetentionPeriod` attribute. If it's 0, automated backups are not enabled.
   ```python
   import boto3
   client = boto3.client('rds')
   response = client.describe_db_instances()
   for instance in response['DBInstances']:
       if instance['BackupRetentionPeriod'] == 0:
           print(f"Automated backups are not enabled for {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']}")
   ```

2. Azure:
   - Install the Azure SDK for Python and set up authentication.
   - Use the `servers.list()` function to get a list of all SQL servers.
   - For each server, use the `backup_short_term_retention_policies.list_by_server()` function to get the backup policies.
   - If the `retention_days` attribute is 0, automated backups are not enabled.
   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, "<subscription_id>")
   for server in sql_client.servers.list():
       policy = sql_client.backup_short_term_retention_policies.list_by_server("<resource_group_name>", server.name)
       if policy.retention_days == 0:
           print(f"Automated backups are not enabled for {server.name}")
   ```

3. GCP:
   - Install the Google Cloud SDK for Python and set up authentication.
   - Use the `instances().list()` function to get a list of all SQL instances.
   - For each instance, check the `settings.backupConfiguration.enabled` attribute. If it's False, automated backups are not enabled.
   ```python
   from googleapiclient import discovery
   from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials
   credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
   service = discovery.build('sqladmin', 'v1beta4', credentials=credentials)
   response = service.instances().list(project="<project_id>").execute()
   for instance in response['items']:
       if not instance['settings']['backupConfiguration']['enabled']:
           print(f"Automated backups are not enabled for {instance['name']}")
   ```

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Automated Backups Should Be Enabled" in GCP using GCP console, please follow the below steps:

1. Login to your GCP console.
2. Select the project for which you want to enable automated backups.
3. Go to the left-hand side menu and select the "SQL" option under the "Storage" section.
4. Select the instance for which you want to enable automated backups.
5. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
6. Scroll down to the "Backup" section.
7. In the "Backup configuration" subsection, select the "Enable automatic backups" checkbox.
8. Set the desired backup start time and frequency.
9. Set the desired retention period for the backups.
10. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page to save the changes.

Once you have followed these steps, automated backups will be enabled for your GCP instance and you will be able to ensure that your data is protected in case of any unexpected events.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Automated Backups Should Be Enabled" in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the command prompt or terminal and authenticate to your GCP account using the following command:
```
gcloud auth login
```

2. Once you are authenticated, set the project that you want to remediate the misconfiguration for using the following command:
```
gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
```

3. Check the current status of automated backups for the GCP instance using the following command:
```
gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME] --format="value(settings.backupConfiguration.enabled)"
```

4. If the output of the above command is "False", then automated backups are not enabled for the instance. To enable automated backups, run the following command:
```
gcloud sql instances patch [INSTANCE_NAME] --backup-start-time [HH:MM] --enable-bin-log --backup-location [LOCATION] --backup-retention-period [DAYS] --backup-config-start-time [HH:MM] --backup-config-retain-period [DAYS]
```
Replace the following placeholders with appropriate values:
- [INSTANCE_NAME]: Name of the GCP instance that you want to remediate the misconfiguration for.
- [HH:MM]: Time of day in 24-hour format when you want to start the automated backup.
- [LOCATION]: Location where you want to store the backups.
- [DAYS]: Number of days that you want to retain the backups.

For example:
```
gcloud sql instances patch my-instance --backup-start-time 03:00 --enable-bin-log --backup-location us-central1 --backup-retention-period 7 --backup-config-start-time 03:00 --backup-config-retain-period 7
```

5. After running the above command, automated backups will be enabled for the GCP instance. You can verify the status of automated backups using the following command:
```
gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME] --format="value(settings.backupConfiguration.enabled)"
```

That's it! You have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Automated Backups Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Automated Backups Should Be Enabled" in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from googleapiclient import discovery
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials
```

2. Authenticate and create a client object:

```python
credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
service = discovery.build('sqladmin', 'v1beta4', credentials=credentials)
```

3. Get the list of all instances:

```python
instances = service.instances().list(project='project-id', filter='').execute()
```

4. Loop through each instance and check if automated backups are enabled:

```python
for instance in instances['items']:
    instance_name = instance['name']
    backup_configuration = instance['settings']['backupConfiguration']
    if not backup_configuration['enabled']:
        # Enable automated backups
        backup_configuration['enabled'] = True
        request = service.instances().update(project='project-id', instance=instance_name, body={'settings': {'backupConfiguration': backup_configuration}})
        response = request.execute()
        print(f"Automated backups enabled for instance {instance_name}")
    else:
        print(f"Automated backups already enabled for instance {instance_name}")
```

5. Replace the `project-id` with your actual project ID and run the script.

This will enable automated backups for all the instances in the specified GCP project.
