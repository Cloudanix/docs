How to disable public access to SQL DB Instance?

#### Using GCP Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console using your GCP account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Cloud SQL section by selecting "SQL" from the main menu.
3. Select the SQL database instance that is publicly accessible.
4. In the instance details page, click on the "Connections" tab.
5. Under the "Public IP" section, you will see the option to disable the public IP. Click on the "Disable" button to remove the public IP address from the instance.
6. Confirm the action when prompted.
7. Once the public IP is disabled, the instance will only be accessible from within your VPC network or using private IP addresses.
8. If you want to access the database instance from specific authorized networks or IP ranges, you can set up authorized networks by following these additional steps:
   - In the instance details page, click on the "Connections" tab.
   - Under the "Authorized networks" section, click on the "Add network" button.
   - Enter the IP range or specific IP address of the network you want to authorize for access to the instance.
   - Click on the "Done" button to save the authorized network settings.
   - Repeat this step to add additional authorized networks, if needed.
9. Review the instance details to ensure that the public IP is disabled and access is restricted to authorized networks or private IP addresses.
10. Test the accessibility of the database instance from unauthorized networks to confirm that it is now restricted as intended.
