<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of SQL instances not configured with the latest SQL versions in GCP, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the GCP console.
2. Go to the SQL instances page.
3. Identify the SQL instances that are not configured with the latest SQL versions.
4. Click on the name of the instance that needs to be remediated.
5. In the instance details page, click on the 'Edit' button.
6. Scroll down to the 'Database version' section.
7. Select the latest version of the SQL database that is available from the dropdown list.
8. Click on the 'Save' button to save the changes.
9. Wait for the instance to be updated with the latest SQL version.

By following the above steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of SQL instances not configured with the latest SQL versions in GCP.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate this misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.

2. Run the following command to list all the SQL instances in the project:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances list
   ```

3. Identify the SQL instance that needs to be updated to the latest version.

4. Run the following command to update the SQL instance to the latest version:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances patch [INSTANCE_NAME] --database-version=[LATEST_VERSION]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of the SQL instance that needs to be updated, and `[LATEST_VERSION]` with the latest version of the SQL database engine.

   For example, if the SQL instance name is `my-sql-instance` and the latest version is `SQLSERVER_2019_STANDARD`, the command would be:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances patch my-sql-instance --database-version=SQLSERVER_2019_STANDARD
   ```

5. Wait for the update to complete. It may take several minutes for the update to finish.

6. Verify that the SQL instance is updated to the latest version by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of the SQL instance.

   Check the `databaseVersion` field to ensure that it reflects the latest version of the SQL database engine.

   That's it! The SQL instance has now been updated to the latest version.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of SQL Instances not being configured with the latest SQL versions in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to identify all the SQL instances that are not configured with the latest SQL versions. You can use the `google-cloud-sql` Python library to get a list of all the SQL instances in your GCP project.

2. Once you have the list of SQL instances, you can check the version of each instance using the `get` method of the `Instance` class in the `google-cloud-sql` library. You can compare the version of each instance with the latest version available and identify the instances that are not configured with the latest version.

3. After identifying the instances that are not configured with the latest version, you can update the SQL instances to the latest version using the `patch` method of the `Instance` class in the `google-cloud-sql` library. You can set the `database_version` parameter to the latest version available for the SQL instance.

Here is the sample Python code to remediate the misconfiguration of SQL Instances not being configured with the latest SQL versions in GCP:

```
from google.cloud import sql_v1beta4
from google.oauth2 import service_account

# Set the GCP project ID and service account credentials
project_id = '<your-project-id>'
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path-to-service-account-key-file>')

# Create a client to access the SQL instances
client = sql_v1beta4.CloudSqlInstancesServiceClient(credentials=credentials)

# Get a list of all the SQL instances in the project
instances = client.list(project=project_id)

# Iterate over each instance and check if it is configured with the latest version
for instance in instances:
    # Get the current version of the SQL instance
    current_version = instance.database_version
    
    # Check if the current version is not the latest version
    if current_version != 'MYSQL_8_0':
        # Update the SQL instance to the latest version
        instance.database_version = 'MYSQL_8_0'
        operation = client.patch(instance=instance, update_mask=['database_version'])
        
        # Wait for the operation to complete
        operation.result()
```

Note: You need to replace `<your-project-id>` and `<path-to-service-account-key-file>` with your actual GCP project ID and the path to your service account key file, respectively. Also, you need to update the `database_version` parameter in the `patch` method with the latest version available for your SQL instance.
