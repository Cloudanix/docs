### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console: Navigate to the GCP console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google account that has the necessary permissions to access the database services.

2. Navigate to SQL Instances: From the GCP console dashboard, go to the navigation menu (hamburger icon on the top left corner), scroll down and click on "SQL" under the "Storage" section. This will take you to the SQL instances page where you can see all your SQL databases.

3. Select the PostgreSQL instance: From the list of SQL instances, click on the PostgreSQL instance for which you want to check the log_hostname flag.

4. Check the Flags: In the instance details page, click on the "Configuration" tab. Scroll down to the "Flags" section. Here, look for the "log_hostname" flag. If it's not present or if it's set to 'off', then the PostgreSQL Log Hostname Flag is not turned on.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, authenticate your Google Cloud account by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. After successful authentication, you can list all the SQL instances in your project by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all SQL instances along with their details.

3. Now, for each SQL instance, you can get the details of the flags by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of your SQL instance. This command will return a detailed description of the SQL instance including its flags.

4. Finally, to check if the PostgreSQL Log Hostname flag is on, you need to look for the `log_hostname` flag in the output of the previous command. If the value of this flag is `on`, then the PostgreSQL Log Hostname flag is on. If the flag is not present or its value is `off`, then the PostgreSQL Log Hostname flag is off.

#### Using Python

To check if the PostgreSQL Log Hostname Flag is on in SQL using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to PostgreSQL Database:**
   First, you need to connect to your PostgreSQL database. You can use the `psycopg2` library in Python to do this. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import psycopg2
   try:
       connection = psycopg2.connect(user = "your_username",
                                     password = "your_password",
                                     host = "your_host",
                                     port = "your_port",
                                     database = "your_database")
       cursor = connection.cursor()
   except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error :
       print ("Error while connecting to PostgreSQL", error)
   ```

2. **Execute SQL Query:**
   After successfully connecting to the database, you can execute an SQL query to check the status of the log_hostname configuration. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   try:
       cursor.execute("SHOW log_hostname;")
       record = cursor.fetchone()
       print("You are connected to - ", record,"\n")
   except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error :
       print ("Error while connecting to PostgreSQL", error)
   ```

3. **Check the Result:**
   The result of the query will be either `on` or `off`. If the result is `on`, it means the PostgreSQL Log Hostname Flag is on. If the result is `off`, it means the PostgreSQL Log Hostname Flag is off.

4. **Close the Connection:**
   After checking the status, don't forget to close the connection to the database. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   if(connection):
       cursor.close()
       connection.close()
       print("PostgreSQL connection is closed")
   ```

Please replace "your_username", "your_password", "your_host", "your_port", and "your_database" with your actual PostgreSQL database details.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the PostgreSQL Log Hostname Flag Should Be On misconfiguration for GCP using GCP console, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project containing the PostgreSQL instance.

2. In the left navigation menu, select "SQL" to open the Cloud SQL instances page.

3. Select the PostgreSQL instance for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

4. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page to open the instance settings.

5. Scroll down to the "Flags" section and click on "Add item".

6. In the "Name" field, enter "log_hostname" and in the "Value" field, enter "on".

7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

8. Wait for the changes to be applied. This may take a few minutes.

9. Once the changes are applied, verify that the PostgreSQL Log Hostname Flag is now turned on by checking the PostgreSQL logs.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the PostgreSQL Log Hostname Flag Should Be On misconfiguration for GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the PostgreSQL Log Hostname Flag Should Be On misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.

Step 2: Run the below command to set the log_hostname flag to on for the PostgreSQL instance:

```
gcloud sql instances patch [INSTANCE_NAME] --database-flags log_hostname=on
```

Note: Replace [INSTANCE_NAME] with the name of your PostgreSQL instance.

Step 3: Verify the configuration change by running the below command:

```
gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME] | grep log_hostname
```

Note: Replace [INSTANCE_NAME] with the name of your PostgreSQL instance.

This command should return the output "log_hostname: on" which indicates that the flag has been set to on.

Step 4: Repeat the above steps for all the PostgreSQL instances in your GCP project to ensure that the misconfiguration is remediated.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the PostgreSQL Log Hostname Flag Should Be On misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the PostgreSQL Log Hostname Flag Should Be On misconfiguration in GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a service account with the necessary permissions to access the PostgreSQL instance.

2. Install the `google-cloud-sql` library using pip.

3. Use the following Python code to update the PostgreSQL instance configuration to enable the `log_hostname` flag:

```python
from google.cloud import sql_v1beta4
from google.oauth2 import service_account

# Set the project ID, instance name, and configuration name
project_id = 'your-project-id'
instance_name = 'your-instance-name'
config_name = 'your-config-name'

# Set the service account credentials
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/credentials.json')

# Create the SQL Admin API client
client = sql_v1beta4.CloudSqlInstancesServiceClient(credentials=credentials)

# Get the current configuration settings
instance_path = f'projects/{project_id}/instances/{instance_name}'
instance = client.get(instance_path)
settings = instance.settings

# Update the configuration settings to enable the log_hostname flag
settings.database_flags['log_hostname'] = 'on'
settings.settings_version += 1

# Update the instance configuration
config_path = f'projects/{project_id}/configs/{config_name}'
update_mask = {'paths': ['database_flags']}
operation = client.patch(instance_path, instance, update_mask=update_mask)

# Wait for the operation to complete
operation.result()
```

Note: Replace `your-project-id`, `your-instance-name`, and `your-config-name` with your actual values. Also, replace `path/to/credentials.json` with the path to your service account credentials file.

This code will update the PostgreSQL instance configuration to enable the `log_hostname` flag.
