### More Info:

The log_statement_stats flag controls the inclusion of end to end performance statistics of a SQL query in the PostgreSQL logs for each query. This cannot be enabled with other module statistics (log_parser_stats, log_planner_stats, log_executor_stats). Default value for log_statement_stats flag is off. The log_statement_stats flag enables a crude profiling method for logging end to end performance statistics of a SQL query. This can be useful for troubleshooting but may increase the amount of logs significantly and have performance overhead.
