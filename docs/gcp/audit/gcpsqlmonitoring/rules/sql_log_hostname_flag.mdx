### More Info:

Logging hostnames allows for the association of hostname to IP address at the time of connection. This information can aid with incident response efforts particularly in an environment that utilized dynamic IP addresses. Logging hostnames may incur overhead on server performance as for each statement logged, DNS resolution will be required to convert IP address to hostname. Depending on the setup, this may be non-negligible. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.
