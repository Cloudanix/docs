### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Login to Google Cloud Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google Cloud account credentials.

2. Navigate to SQL Instances: From the left-hand side menu, navigate to "SQL" under the "Storage" section. This will display a list of all SQL instances in your project.

3. Check Instance Configuration: Click on the name of the SQL instance you want to check. This will open the instance details page. Under the "Overview" tab, look for the "Location" section.

4. Verify Multi-AZ Configuration: In the "Location" section, check if the instance is configured to be Multi-AZ. If the instance is Multi-AZ, it will show "Primary Zone" and "Standby Zone". If only "Primary Zone" is displayed, then the instance is not Multi-AZ.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate the Google Cloud SDK CLI: The Google Cloud SDK is a set of tools that you can use to manage resources and applications hosted on Google Cloud. You can install it on your local machine and authenticate it with your Google Cloud account.

   Installation: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
   Authentication: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login

2. List all SQL instances: Use the following command to list all SQL instances in your project.

   ```
   gcloud sql instances list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all SQL instances, including their name, region, tier, and status.

3. Check the availability type of each instance: For each instance, use the following command to check its availability type.

   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of your instance. This command will return a detailed description of the instance, including its availability type. If the availability type is `ZONAL`, the instance is not Multi-AZ.

4. Use a script to automate the process: If you have many instances, you can use a script to automate the process. Here is a simple Python script that uses the Google Cloud SDK CLI to check the availability type of all SQL instances.

   ```python
   import subprocess

   # Get the list of all SQL instances
   instances = subprocess.check_output(["gcloud", "sql", "instances", "list"]).decode().split("\n")

   # For each instance, check its availability type
   for instance in instances[1:-1]:  # Skip the first line (header) and the last line (empty)
       instance_name = instance.split()[0]  # The name is the first column
       description = subprocess.check_output(["gcloud", "sql", "instances", "describe", instance_name]).decode()
       if "availabilityType: ZONAL" in description:
           print(f"Instance {instance_name} is not Multi-AZ")
   ```

   This script will print the names of all instances that are not Multi-AZ.

#### Using Python

1. Import the necessary libraries: You will need the boto3 library, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc.

```python
import boto3
```

2. Create a session using your AWS credentials. You can also use the AWS CLI's default configuration.

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='us-west-2'
)
```

3. Now, create a client for 'rds' which is Amazon Relational Database Service.

```python
rds = session.client('rds')
```

4. Now, we will describe all the DB instances and check if they are Multi-AZ or not. If the 'MultiAZ' attribute is False, then it is a misconfiguration.

```python
def check_multi_az():
    response = rds.describe_db_instances()
    for instance in response['DBInstances']:
        if not instance['MultiAZ']:
            print(f"DB instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} is not Multi AZ")

check_multi_az()
```

This script will print out the identifiers of all DB instances that are not Multi AZ. You can modify this script according to your needs, for example, you can add a remediation step or send this information to a security team.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

In GCP, the equivalent of Multi-AZ in AWS is called "Instance Group". Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Compute Engine section.
2. Select the instance that needs to be remediated.
3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
4. Scroll down to the "Availability Policy" section.
5. Check the box next to "Create a new instance group" and select the region where the group will be created.
6. Choose the "Regional" option for the instance group type.
7. In the "Size" field, enter the number of instances you want to create in the group.
8. Click on "Save" to create the instance group.

Once the instance group is created, the instance will automatically be replicated across multiple zones within the selected region, providing Multi-AZ functionality.

#### Using CLI

In GCP, the equivalent of Multi AZ is called Regional Managed Instance Groups. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.
2. Run the following command to create a new regional managed instance group:

```
gcloud compute instance-groups managed create [INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME] --region [REGION] --template [INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME] --size [SIZE]
```

Replace [INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME] with the name you want to give your instance group, [REGION] with the region where you want to create the group, [INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME] with the name of the instance template you want to use, and [SIZE] with the desired number of instances in the group.

3. Verify that the instance group has been created successfully by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute instance-groups list
```

This command will display a list of all the instance groups in your project. Verify that the new instance group is listed.

4. Once the instance group is created, you can add instances to it by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-autoscaling [INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME] --region [REGION] --max-num-replicas [MAX_REPLICAS] --target-cpu-utilization [CPU_UTILIZATION]
```

Replace [INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME] with the name of your instance group, [REGION] with the region where the group is located, [MAX_REPLICAS] with the maximum number of instances you want in the group, and [CPU_UTILIZATION] with the target CPU utilization percentage that triggers the autoscaling.

5. Verify that the autoscaling has been set up successfully by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute instance-groups managed describe-autoscaler [INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME] --region [REGION]
```

This command will display the details of the autoscaler for the specified instance group.

With these steps, you have successfully created a regional managed instance group with autoscaling enabled. This will ensure that your instances are highly available and can handle increased traffic or workload.

#### Using Python

In GCP, instances can be made highly available by using instance groups and regional managed instance groups. The regional managed instance groups provide high availability by automatically distributing instances across multiple zones within a region. Follow the below steps to remediate the misconfiguration:

1. First, create an instance template that specifies the configuration for the instances that you want to create.

```python
from googleapiclient import discovery

compute = discovery.build('compute', 'v1')

project = 'my-project' # Replace with your project ID
zone = 'us-central1-a' # Replace with your desired zone
name = 'my-instance-template' # Replace with the desired name for your instance template

config = {
    'name': name,
    'properties': {
        'machineType': f'zones/{zone}/machineTypes/n1-standard-1',
        'disks': [
            {
                'boot': True,
                'autoDelete': True,
                'initializeParams': {
                    'sourceImage': 'projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-10'
                }
            }
        ],
        'networkInterfaces': [
            {
                'network': 'global/networks/default',
                'accessConfigs': [
                    {
                        'type': 'ONE_TO_ONE_NAT',
                        'name': 'External NAT'
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        'metadata': {
            'items': [
                {
                    'key': 'startup-script',
                    'value': '#!/bin/bash\napt-get update\napt-get install apache2 -y\n'
                }
            ]
        },
        'serviceAccounts': [
            {
                'email': 'default',
                'scopes': [
                    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_write',
                    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write'
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}

request = compute.instanceTemplates().insert(project=project, body=config)
response = request.execute()

print(f'Instance template {name} created.')
```

2. Next, create a regional managed instance group using the instance template. This will automatically distribute instances across multiple zones within the region.

```python
from googleapiclient import discovery

compute = discovery.build('compute', 'v1')

project = 'my-project' # Replace with your project ID
zone = 'us-central1' # Replace with your desired zone
name = 'my-instance-group' # Replace with the desired name for your instance group
template = 'projects/my-project/global/instanceTemplates/my-instance-template' # Replace with the name of your instance template

config = {
    'name': name,
    'region': f'{zone}-b',
    'baseInstanceName': 'my-instance',
    'instanceTemplate': template,
    'targetSize': 2,
    'autoHealingPolicies': [
        {
            'initialDelaySec': 300,
            'healthCheck': 'projects/my-project/global/httpHealthChecks/my-http-health-check'
        }
    ]
}

request = compute.regionInstanceGroups().insert(project=project, body=config)
response = request.execute()

print(f'Regional managed instance group {name} created.')
```

3. Finally, verify that the instances are running in multiple zones within the region.

```python
from googleapiclient import discovery

compute = discovery.build('compute', 'v1')

project = 'my-project' # Replace with your project ID
zone = 'us-central1' # Replace with your desired zone
name = 'my-instance-group' # Replace with the name of your instance group

request = compute.regionInstanceGroups().listInstances(project=project, region=f'{zone}-b', instanceGroup=name)
response = request.execute()

for instance in response['items']:
    print(f'{instance["name"]} is running in zone {instance["zone"]}.')
```

This will ensure that the instances are running in multiple zones within the region, providing high availability and ensuring that your application remains available even if one zone experiences an outage.
