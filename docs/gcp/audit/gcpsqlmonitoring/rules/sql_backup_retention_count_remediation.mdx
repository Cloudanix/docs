### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to SQL Instances: From the left-hand side menu, click on "SQL" under the "Storage" section. This will open up a list of all your SQL instances.

3. Select the SQL Instance: Click on the name of the SQL instance for which you want to check the minimum number of SQL backups to be retained.

4. Check Backup Configuration: In the SQL instance details page, click on "Backups" from the left-hand side menu. Here, you can see the backup configuration details including the retention settings. The "Retention" field shows the number of backups that are retained.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website. After installation, authenticate your account using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. List all SQL instances: Use the following command to list all SQL instances in your project:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all SQL instances, including their instance ID, database version, location, and status.

3. Describe SQL instance: To get detailed information about a specific SQL instance, including backup configuration, use the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of the SQL instance you want to inspect. This command will return a JSON object with detailed information about the SQL instance.

4. Check backup configuration: In the output of the previous command, look for the `settings.backupConfiguration` field. This field contains information about the backup configuration of the SQL instance, including the number of backups to be retained (`retainedBackups`). If this value is less than the recommended minimum, it indicates a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

1. **AWS RDS:**

   You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS RDS. Here is a sample script to check the number of backups retained for a specific RDS instance:

   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('rds')
   response = client.describe_db_instances(DBInstanceIdentifier='your-db-instance')

   backup_retention_period = response['DBInstances'][0]['BackupRetentionPeriod']
   print(f'Backup Retention Period: {backup_retention_period}')
   ```

   Replace 'your-db-instance' with the identifier of your RDS instance. The script will print the number of days that automated backups are retained.

2. **Azure SQL Database:**

   You can use the Azure SDK for Python to interact with Azure SQL Database. Here is a sample script to check the number of backups retained for a specific SQL database:

   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, 'your-subscription-id')

   backup_short_term_retention_policies = sql_client.backup_short_term_retention_policies.list_by_database(
       'your-resource-group', 'your-server', 'your-database')

   for policy in backup_short_term_retention_policies:
       print(f'Retention Days: {policy.retention_days}')
   ```

   Replace 'your-subscription-id', 'your-resource-group', 'your-server', and 'your-database' with your Azure subscription ID, resource group name, SQL server name, and database name, respectively. The script will print the number of days that short-term backups are retained.

3. **Google Cloud SQL:**

   You can use the Google Cloud Client Library for Python to interact with Google Cloud SQL. Here is a sample script to check the number of backups retained for a specific Cloud SQL instance:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import sql

   client = sql.SqlInstancesServiceClient()
   instance_name = 'projects/your-project-id/instances/your-instance-id'

   instance = client.get(instance_name)
   backup_configuration = instance.settings.backup_configuration

   print(f'Backup Retention Enabled: {backup_configuration.enabled}')
   print(f'Backup Retention Binary Log Enabled: {backup_configuration.binary_log_enabled}')
   print(f'Backup Retention Replication Log Archiving Enabled: {backup_configuration.replication_log_archiving_enabled}')
   print(f'Backup Retention Start Time: {backup_configuration.start_time}')
   ```

   Replace 'your-project-id' and 'your-instance-id' with your Google Cloud project ID and Cloud SQL instance ID, respectively. The script will print whether backup retention is enabled and the start time of the backup window.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

The "Minimum Number of SQL Backups To Be Retained" misconfiguration means that the minimum number of backups required for a Cloud SQL instance is not set. This can lead to data loss in case of unexpected failures or errors. To remediate this issue in GCP using GCP console, please follow the steps below:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Cloud SQL instances page.

2. Select the instance for which you want to configure the backup retention policy.

3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.

4. In the "Backup" section, scroll down to the "Retention" field.

5. Set the "Minimum number of backups to be retained" to the desired value. It is recommended to retain at least 7 backups.

6. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

7. Verify that the backup retention policy has been updated by checking the "Backups" tab for the instance.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Minimum Number of SQL Backups To Be Retained" misconfiguration for a Cloud SQL instance in GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

The misconfiguration "Minimum Number of SQL Backups To Be Retained" in GCP can be remediated by following these steps using GCP CLI:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to list all the available Cloud SQL instances:

```
gcloud sql instances list
```

3. Choose the instance for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

4. Run the following command to set the minimum number of backups to be retained:

```
gcloud sql instances patch [INSTANCE_NAME] --backup-retention-window [NUMBER_OF_DAYS]
```

Replace [INSTANCE_NAME] with the name of your instance and [NUMBER_OF_DAYS] with the minimum number of days for which you want to retain the backups.

For example, if you want to retain backups for a minimum of 7 days, run the following command:

```
gcloud sql instances patch my-instance --backup-retention-window 7
```

5. Verify that the configuration has been updated by running the following command:

```
gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
```

This will display the details of your instance, including the updated backup retention window.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Minimum Number of SQL Backups To Be Retained" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

The misconfiguration "Minimum Number of SQL Backups To Be Retained" means that there is no minimum number of backups set for the SQL database in GCP. This can lead to data loss in case of any disaster or system failure. To remediate this misconfiguration, we need to set the minimum number of backups to be retained. 

Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate this misconfiguration for GCP using Python:

1. First, we need to install the required libraries. Open the command prompt and run the following command:
   
   ```
   pip install google-cloud-storage google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-cloud-sql
   ```

2. Next, we need to authenticate ourselves with the GCP project. For this, we need to create a service account and download the JSON key file. Follow the instructions given in the link to create a service account: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts

3. Once the service account is created, download the JSON key file and set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the path of the JSON key file.

   ```
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/key.json"
   ```

4. Now, we can write a Python script to remediate the misconfiguration. Here is a sample script to set the minimum number of backups to be retained to 7:

   ```python
   from google.oauth2 import service_account
   from google.cloud import sql_v1beta4
   from google.cloud.sql_v1beta4.services.sql_backup_runs_service import SqlBackupRunsServiceClient

   # Authenticate with GCP using the service account key file
   credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('/path/to/key.json')

   # Set the project ID and instance name
   project_id = 'project-id'
   instance_name = 'instance-name'

   # Set the minimum number of backups to be retained
   retention_count = 7

   # Create a client object for the SQL Backup Runs API
   backup_runs_client = SqlBackupRunsServiceClient(credentials=credentials)

   # Get the latest backup run for the instance
   backup_runs = backup_runs_client.list(project=project_id, instance=instance_name).items
   latest_backup_run = sorted(backup_runs, key=lambda x: x.end_time, reverse=True)[0]

   # Set the retention policy for the latest backup run
   retention_policy = sql_v1beta4.types.BackupRetentionSettings(retention_unit='COUNT', retention_count=retention_count)
   backup_runs_client.update(project=project_id, instance=instance_name, id=latest_backup_run.id, body={'settings': {'backupRetentionSettings': retention_policy}})
   ```

   Replace `project-id`, `instance-name`, and `/path/to/key.json` with the appropriate values.

5. Save the script with a `.py` extension and run it using the following command:

   ```
   python script_name.py
   ```

6. After running the script, the minimum number of backups to be retained for the SQL database will be set to the specified value.
