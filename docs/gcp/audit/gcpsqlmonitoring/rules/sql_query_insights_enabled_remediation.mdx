### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console: Navigate to the GCP Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google account. If you don't have an account, you'll need to create one.

2. Navigate to SQL Instances: From the GCP Console dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner). Scroll down and click on "SQL" under the "Storage" section. This will take you to the SQL instances page where you can see all your SQL instances.

3. Select the SQL Instance: Click on the name of the SQL instance you want to check. This will take you to the instance details page.

4. Check SQL Query Insights: On the instance details page, scroll down to the "Insights" section. Here, you should see an option for "Query Insights". If it's enabled, you'll see a green check mark or "Enabled" next to it. If it's not, you'll see a red X or "Disabled".

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions for your specific operating system.

2. Authenticate your GCP account using the following command. This will open a new window in your web browser asking you to log in with your Google account.
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. Set your GCP project ID to the project you want to check. Replace `your-project-id` with your actual project ID.
   ```
   gcloud config set project your-project-id
   ```

4. Run the following command to list all the SQL instances in your project and check if SQL Query Insights is enabled. Replace `your-instance-id` with your actual instance ID.
   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe your-instance-id --format="value(settings.insightsConfig.queryInsightsEnabled)"
   ```
   If the output is `true`, then SQL Query Insights is enabled. If the output is `false` or if there is no output, then SQL Query Insights is not enabled.

#### Using Python

To check if SQL Query Insights is enabled in SQL using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install the necessary libraries**: You need to install the Google Cloud SDK and the Google Cloud Client Library for Python. You can install these using pip:

   ```python
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-sdk
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-sql
   ```

2. **Authenticate your application**: Before you can interact with Google Cloud resources, you need to authenticate your application. You can do this by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key file:

   ```python
   import os
   os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"]="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
   ```

3. **Initialize the SQL Admin Service**: You can use the `google.cloud.sql_v1beta4` module to interact with the SQL Admin API. You need to create an instance of the `SqlAdminService` class:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import sql_v1beta4
   sql_admin_service = sql_v1beta4.SqlAdminServiceClient()
   ```

4. **Check if SQL Query Insights is enabled**: You can use the `get` method of the `SqlAdminService` instance to retrieve the settings of a SQL instance. The `settings` field of the response will contain a `queryInsightsConfig` field if Query Insights is enabled:

   ```python
   instance_name = "projects/{project_id}/instances/{instance_id}".format(
       project_id="your-project-id", instance_id="your-instance-id"
   )
   instance = sql_admin_service.get(instance_name)
   query_insights_enabled = "queryInsightsConfig" in instance.settings
   print("Query Insights is enabled: ", query_insights_enabled)
   ```

This script will print `True` if Query Insights is enabled for the specified SQL instance, and `False` otherwise.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "SQL Query Insights should be Enabled" for GCP using the GCP Console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP Console and go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
2. Select the instance for which you want to enable SQL Query Insights.
3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
4. Scroll down to the "Flags" section and click on the "Add item" button.
5. In the "Name" field, enter "query-insights-enabled".
6. In the "Value" field, enter "on".
7. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page to save the changes.

After following the above steps, SQL Query Insights will be enabled for the selected Cloud SQL instance in GCP.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the SQL Query Insights misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to enable SQL Query Insights for a Cloud SQL instance:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances patch [INSTANCE_NAME] --database-flags cloudsql.enable_query_log=on
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of your Cloud SQL instance.

3. Verify that SQL Query Insights is enabled by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME] | grep queryLog
   ```

   If SQL Query Insights is enabled, the output should include `"queryLogConfig": {"enableQueryLog": true}`.

That's it! SQL Query Insights should now be enabled for your Cloud SQL instance in GCP.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "SQL Query Insights should be Enabled" in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.cloud.bigquery import QueryJobConfig
```

2. Create a client object for the BigQuery API:

```python
client = bigquery.Client()
```

3. Define the project ID and dataset ID where the query insights should be enabled:

```python
project_id = 'your-project-id'
dataset_id = 'your-dataset-id'
```

4. Enable query insights for the dataset:

```python
dataset_ref = client.dataset(dataset_id, project=project_id)
dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_ref)
dataset.default_query_job_config.use_query_cache = False
dataset.default_query_job_config.use_legacy_sql = False
dataset.default_query_job_config.labels = {"queryinsights-enabled": "true"}
client.update_dataset(dataset, ["labels"])
```

This code will update the dataset with a label "queryinsights-enabled" set to "true", which will enable query insights for the dataset.

Note: To run this code, you need to have the necessary permissions to update the dataset in GCP.
