### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to SQL Instances: From the left-hand side menu, navigate to SQL under the Storage section. This will display a list of all SQL instances in your project.

3. Check Encryption Key: Click on the name of the SQL instance you want to check. Under the "Overview" tab, look for the "Encryption" section. If the instance is encrypted using a customer-managed key, it will display "Customer-managed key" next to "Encryption".

4. Verify Key Source: To ensure the key is customer-managed, click on the "Show Info Panel" button on the top right corner of the page. Under the "Encryption" section, it should display the name of the customer-managed key used for encryption. If it displays "Google-managed key", then the instance is not encrypted using a customer-managed key.

Remember, these steps only allow you to check if a SQL instance is encrypted using a customer-managed key. If you find any instances that are not, you will need to take additional steps to remediate this misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, authenticate your Google Cloud account by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. After successful authentication, you can list all the SQL instances in your project by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all SQL instances along with their details.

3. Now, for each SQL instance, you can check the encryption configuration by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of your SQL instance. This command will return the details of the specified SQL instance.

4. In the output of the above command, look for the `diskEncryptionConfiguration` field. If the `kmsKeyName` field under it is empty or not present, it means that the SQL instance is not encrypted using a Customer Managed Key (CMK). If the `kmsKeyName` field is present and contains a value, it means that the SQL instance is encrypted using a CMK.

#### Using Python

1. **AWS:**
   - Install and configure AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).
   - Use the `describe_db_instances()` function to retrieve the metadata for all DB instances.
   - For each DB instance, check the `KmsKeyId` attribute. If it's not set or set to an AWS-managed key, the DB instance is not encrypted with a customer-managed key.
   - Python script example:
     ```python
     import boto3

     client = boto3.client('rds')
     response = client.describe_db_instances()

     for instance in response['DBInstances']:
         if 'KmsKeyId' not in instance or instance['KmsKeyId'].startswith('arn:aws:kms:aws:'):
             print(f"DB instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} is not encrypted with a customer-managed key.")
     ```

2. **Azure:**
   - Install and configure Azure SDK for Python.
   - Use the `sql_servers.list()` function to retrieve all SQL servers.
   - For each SQL server, use the `transparent_data_encryption.get()` function to retrieve the encryption settings.
   - Check the `status` attribute. If it's not 'Enabled', the SQL server is not encrypted with a customer-managed key.
   - Python script example:
     ```python
     from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
     from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

     credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
     subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
     sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

     for server in sql_client.sql_servers.list():
         encryption_settings = sql_client.transparent_data_encryption.get(server.resource_group, server.name)
         if encryption_settings.status != 'Enabled':
             print(f"SQL server {server.name} is not encrypted with a customer-managed key.")
     ```

3. **GCP:**
   - Install and configure Google Cloud SDK for Python.
   - Use the `instances().list()` function to retrieve all SQL instances.
   - For each SQL instance, check the `diskEncryptionConfiguration` attribute. If it's not set or set to a Google-managed key, the SQL instance is not encrypted with a customer-managed key.
   - Python script example:
     ```python
     from googleapiclient import discovery
     from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials

     credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
     service = discovery.build('sqladmin', 'v1beta4', credentials=credentials)

     response = service.instances().list(project='your-project-id').execute()

     for instance in response['items']:
         if 'diskEncryptionConfiguration' not in instance or 'kmsKeyName' not in instance['diskEncryptionConfiguration']:
             print(f"SQL instance {instance['name']} is not encrypted with a customer-managed key.")
     ```

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure! Here are the step by step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "SQL Instances Should Be Encrypted Using Customer Managed Keys (CMKs)" for GCP using GCP console:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Cloud SQL instances page.
2. Select the SQL instance that you want to encrypt.
3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
4. Scroll down to the "Encryption" section and select the option "Customer-managed key".
5. Choose the key ring and key that you want to use for encryption. If you don't have a key, create one by clicking on the "Create" button.
6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, your SQL instance will be encrypted using the customer-managed key that you selected. It is important to note that this process requires the appropriate permissions to create and manage keys in your GCP project.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of SQL instances not being encrypted using customer managed keys (CMKs) in GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.

2. Use the following command to list all the Cloud SQL instances in your project:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances list
   ```

3. Choose the instance that you want to encrypt and note down its instance name.

4. Use the following command to encrypt the SQL instance using a customer-managed encryption key:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances patch [INSTANCE_NAME] --backup-start-time 02:00 --require-ssl --storage-auto-increase --storage-size [SIZE] --storage-type [STORAGE_TYPE] --authorized-networks [NETWORK_NAME] --database-version [DATABASE_VERSION] --maintenance-window-day [DAY_OF_WEEK] --maintenance-window-hour [HOUR_OF_DAY] --maintenance-release-channel [RELEASE_CHANNEL] --encryption-key-name [KEY_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of your SQL instance, `[SIZE]` with the desired storage size in GB, `[STORAGE_TYPE]` with the desired storage type, `[NETWORK_NAME]` with the name of the authorized network, `[DATABASE_VERSION]` with the desired database version, `[DAY_OF_WEEK]` with the preferred day of the week for maintenance, `[HOUR_OF_DAY]` with the preferred hour of the day for maintenance, `[RELEASE_CHANNEL]` with the preferred release channel for maintenance, and `[KEY_NAME]` with the name of the customer-managed encryption key.

5. Once you have executed the command, the SQL instance will be encrypted using the customer-managed encryption key.

6. Verify the encryption status of the SQL instance using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
   ```

   You should see the `encryptionKeyName` property set to the name of your customer-managed encryption key.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of SQL instances not being encrypted using customer-managed keys (CMKs) in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of SQL instances not being encrypted using customer-managed keys (CMKs) in GCP, you can use the following steps:

1. Create a new Cloud KMS key ring and key to use as the CMK. You can do this using the following Python code:

```
from google.cloud import kms_v1

kms_client = kms_v1.KeyManagementServiceClient()

parent = kms_client.key_ring_path(project_id, location_id, key_ring_id)

response = kms_client.create_crypto_key(parent, crypto_key_id, kms_v1.CryptoKey())

print(f'Created key {response.name}')
```

Replace `project_id`, `location_id`, `key_ring_id`, and `crypto_key_id` with your own values.

2. Update the SQL instance to use the newly created CMK. You can do this using the following Python code:

```
from google.cloud import sql_v1beta4

sql_client = sql_v1beta4.CloudSqlInstanceServiceClient()

instance_name = f'projects/{project_id}/instances/{instance_id}'

settings = sql_v1beta4.Settings()

settings.ip_configuration.require_ssl = True
settings.ip_configuration.authorized_networks.enabled = True

encryption_settings = sql_v1beta4.EncryptionSettings()

encryption_settings.kms_key_name = f'projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/keyRings/{key_ring_id}/cryptoKeys/{crypto_key_id}'

settings.encryption_configuration = encryption_settings

request = sql_v1beta4.SqlInstancesUpdateRequest(instance=instance_name, project=project_id, body={'settings': settings})

response = sql_client.update(request=request)

print(f'Updated instance {instance_name} with encryption settings')
```

Replace `project_id`, `instance_id`, `location_id`, `key_ring_id`, and `crypto_key_id` with your own values.

3. Verify that the SQL instance is now using the CMK for encryption. You can do this using the following Python code:

```
response = sql_client.get(instance_name)

encryption_settings = response.settings.encryption_configuration

print(f'Instance {instance_name} is now using CMK {encryption_settings.kms_key_name} for encryption')
```

Replace `instance_name` with your own value.

These steps will remediate the misconfiguration of SQL instances not being encrypted using customer-managed keys (CMKs) in GCP.
