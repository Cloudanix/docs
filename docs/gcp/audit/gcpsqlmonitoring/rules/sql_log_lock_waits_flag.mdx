<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the PostgreSQL Log Lock Waits Flag misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.

2. Connect to your instance using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql connect [INSTANCE_NAME] --user=[USER_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of your Cloud SQL instance and `[USER_NAME]` with the name of the user you want to connect as.

3. Enter the user's password when prompted.

4. Run the following command to disable the log_lock_waits flag:

   ```
   ALTER SYSTEM SET log_lock_waits = off;
   ```

5. Restart your instance to apply the changes:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances restart [INSTANCE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of your Cloud SQL instance.

6. Verify that the flag has been disabled by running the following command:

   ```
   SHOW log_lock_waits;
   ```

   If the output is `off`, then the flag has been successfully disabled.

Congratulations! You have successfully remediated the PostgreSQL Log Lock Waits Flag misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the "PostgreSQL Log Lock Waits Flag Should Be Disabled" misconfiguration in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to authenticate and set up the GCP client library for Python. You can follow the instructions provided in the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) to do this.

2. Next, you need to create a connection to your PostgreSQL instance using the `google-cloud-sql` library. You can use the following code to do this:

```python
from google.cloud import sql
from google.oauth2 import service_account

# Set up the credentials
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/credentials.json')

# Create a client object
client = sql.Client(project='project-id', credentials=credentials)

# Get a reference to your instance
instance = client.instance('instance-id')
```

Make sure to replace `path/to/credentials.json`, `project-id`, and `instance-id` with the appropriate values for your setup.

3. Once you have a reference to your instance, you can disable the `log_lock_waits` flag by updating the instance settings. You can use the following code to do this:

```python
# Get the current settings
settings = instance.database_flags().get()

# Disable the log_lock_waits flag
settings['log_lock_waits'] = False

# Update the settings
operation = instance.update_database_flags(settings)
result = operation.result()
```

This code gets the current database settings, disables the `log_lock_waits` flag, and updates the settings. The `update_database_flags` method returns an operation object, which you can use to check the status of the update.

4. Finally, you can check that the flag has been disabled by querying the instance settings again:

```python
# Get the updated settings
settings = instance.database_flags().get()

# Print the log_lock_waits flag value
print(settings['log_lock_waits'])
```

This code gets the updated database settings and prints the value of the `log_lock_waits` flag. It should be `False` if the remediation was successful.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the "PostgreSQL Log Lock Waits Flag Should Be Disabled" misconfiguration in GCP using Python.
