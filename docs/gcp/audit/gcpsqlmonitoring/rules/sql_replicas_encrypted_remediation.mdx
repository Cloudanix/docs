### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the issue of SQL Read Replica Instances not being encrypted using Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) in GCP Console:

1. Open the GCP Console and navigate to the Cloud SQL instances page.

2. Select the read replica instance that you want to encrypt.

3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.

4. Scroll down to the "Encryption" section and select "Customer-managed key" from the dropdown menu.

5. Click on the "Select a key" button and choose the desired key from the list of available keys.

6. If you don't have a key yet, click on the "Create a key" button and follow the instructions to create a new key.

7. Once you have selected or created the key, click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

8. Wait for the encryption to complete. This may take some time depending on the size of your database.

9. Once the encryption is complete, verify that the replica is now using customer-managed encryption keys by checking the "Encryption" section of the instance details page.

Congratulations! You have successfully remediated the issue of SQL Read Replica Instances not being encrypted using Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) in GCP Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, please follow the below steps:

1. Firstly, identify the SQL Read Replica instance that needs to be encrypted using CMKs. You can use the following command to list all the SQL instances in your GCP project:

```bash
gcloud sql instances list
```

2. Once you have identified the SQL Read Replica instance, you can enable encryption using the following command:

```bash
gcloud sql instances patch [INSTANCE_NAME] --backup-encryption-key [KEY_NAME] --backup-encryption-key-path [KEY_PATH]
```

Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of your SQL Read Replica instance, `[KEY_NAME]` with the name of the CMK that you want to use for encryption, and `[KEY_PATH]` with the path to the CMK.

For example:

```bash
gcloud sql instances patch my-sql-replica --backup-encryption-key my-cmk --backup-encryption-key-path projects/my-project/locations/global/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-cmk
```

3. Verify that the encryption has been enabled for the SQL Read Replica instance using the following command:

```bash
gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME] --format="get(settings.backupConfiguration.enabled)"
```

Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of your SQL Read Replica instance.

The output of the above command should be `True`, indicating that encryption has been enabled for the SQL Read Replica instance using CMKs.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of SQL Read Replica Instances not being encrypted using Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) in GCP.

#### Using Python

To remediate this misconfiguration for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to ensure that you have enabled the Cloud KMS API for your GCP project.

2. Next, you need to create a new customer-managed key (CMK) in the Cloud KMS service. You can use the following Python code to do this:

```python
from google.cloud import kms_v1
from google.cloud.kms_v1 import enums

def create_key(project_id, location_id, key_ring_id, key_id):
    client = kms_v1.KeyManagementServiceClient()
    parent = client.key_ring_path(project_id, location_id, key_ring_id)
    purpose = enums.CryptoKey.CryptoKeyPurpose.ENCRYPT_DECRYPT
    response = client.create_crypto_key(parent, key_id, {'purpose': purpose})
    print('Created key: {}'.format(response.name))

create_key('project-id', 'global', 'my-key-ring', 'my-key-id')
```

3. Once you have created the CMK, you can use it to encrypt the read replica instance. To do this, you can use the `google-cloud-sql` Python library. First, install the library using pip:

```
pip install google-cloud-sql
```

4. Then, you can use the following Python code to encrypt the read replica instance:

```python
from google.cloud.sql_v1beta4 import SqlInstancesServiceClient
from google.cloud.sql_v1beta4.types import SqlInstancesSetRootPasswordRequest

def encrypt_instance(project_id, instance_name, cmk_path):
    client = SqlInstancesServiceClient()
    instance_path = client.instance_path(project_id, 'us-central1', instance_name)
    request = SqlInstancesSetRootPasswordRequest()
    request.instance = instance_path
    request.root_password = 'new-root-password'
    request.encryption_config = {'kind': 'sql#encryptionConfig',
                                 'kms_key_name': cmk_path}
    response = client.instances_service.set_root_password(request)
    print('Encrypted instance: {}'.format(response.name))

encrypt_instance('project-id', 'my-instance', 'projects/project-id/locations/global/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-key-id')
```

In the above code, replace `'project-id'` with your GCP project ID, `'my-instance'` with the name of your read replica instance, and `'projects/project-id/locations/global/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-key-id'` with the path to your CMK.
