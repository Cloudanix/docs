### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account.

2. Navigate to SQL Instances: From the left-hand side menu, navigate to "SQL" under the "Storage" section. This will open up a list of all your SQL instances.

3. Check Instance Details: Click on the name of the SQL instance you want to check. This will open up the instance details page.

4. Check Public IP: In the instance details page, look for the "Connectivity" section. Under this section, if there is an IP address listed under "Public IP", it means that the SQL instance has a public IP. If there is no IP address listed, it means that the SQL instance does not have a public IP.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate the Google Cloud SDK: The Google Cloud SDK includes the gcloud command-line tool, which is necessary to interact with GCP services. You can install it by following the instructions provided by Google Cloud. After installation, authenticate the SDK using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. List all SQL instances: Use the `gcloud` command to list all SQL instances in your project. The command is `gcloud sql instances list`. This will return a list of all SQL instances, including their names, project IDs, and other details.

3. Describe the SQL instance: For each SQL instance, use the `gcloud sql instances describe` command to get detailed information about the instance. The command is `gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]`. Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of your SQL instance.

4. Check for public IP: In the output of the describe command, look for the `ipAddresses` field. If the `type` is `PRIMARY` and `ipAddress` is not empty, then the SQL instance has a public IP. If the `ipAddress` field is empty or the `type` is not `PRIMARY`, then the SQL instance does not have a public IP.

#### Using Python

1. AWS:
   - Install boto3, the AWS SDK for Python, and set up authentication.
   - Use the `describe_db_instances` method to get a list of all DB instances.
   - For each instance, check the `PubliclyAccessible` attribute. If it's `True`, the instance has a public IP.
   - Python script:
     ```python
     import boto3
     client = boto3.client('rds')
     response = client.describe_db_instances()
     for instance in response['DBInstances']:
         if instance['PubliclyAccessible']:
             print(f"DB instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} has a public IP.")
     ```

2. Azure:
   - Install the Azure SDK for Python and set up authentication.
   - Use the `servers.list` method to get a list of all SQL servers.
   - For each server, use the `firewall_rules.list_by_server` method to get its firewall rules.
   - If a rule has `start_ip_address` as '0.0.0.0' and `end_ip_address` as '255.255.255.255', the server has a public IP.
   - Python script:
     ```python
     from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
     from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
     credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
     subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
     sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
     for server in sql_client.servers.list():
         for rule in sql_client.firewall_rules.list_by_server(server.resource_group, server.name):
             if rule.start_ip_address == '0.0.0.0' and rule.end_ip_address == '255.255.255.255':
                 print(f"SQL server {server.name} has a public IP.")
     ```

3. GCP:
   - Install the Google Cloud SDK for Python and set up authentication.
   - Use the `instances().list` method to get a list of all SQL instances.
   - For each instance, check the `settings.ipConfiguration.authorizedNetworks` attribute. If it contains '0.0.0.0/0', the instance has a public IP.
   - Python script:
     ```python
     from googleapiclient import discovery
     from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials
     credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
     service = discovery.build('sqladmin', 'v1beta4', credentials=credentials)
     project = 'your-project-id'
     instances = service.instances().list(project=project).execute()
     for instance in instances['items']:
         if '0.0.0.0/0' in instance['settings']['ipConfiguration']['authorizedNetworks']:
             print(f"SQL instance {instance['name']} has a public IP.")
     ```

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the "Database Instances Should Not Have Public IPs" misconfiguration in GCP using the GCP console:

1. Open the GCP Console and go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.

2. Select the instance for which you want to remove the public IP.

3. Click the Edit button at the top of the page.

4. In the Connectivity section, click on the "Public IP" dropdown and select "None".

5. Click the Save button to apply the changes.

6. After removing the public IP, make sure to update your application or services to use the private IP address of the instance for database connectivity.

7. Verify that the public IP has been removed by checking the instance details page. The "Public IP" field should show as "None".

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the "Database Instances Should Not Have Public IPs" misconfiguration in GCP.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Database Instances Should Not Have Public IPs" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell from the GCP console.

2. Run the following command to list all the database instances in your GCP project:

```
gcloud sql instances list
```

3. Identify the instance that has a public IP address.

4. Run the following command to update the instance's settings and remove the public IP address:

```
gcloud sql instances patch [INSTANCE_NAME] --no-assign-ip
```

Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of the instance that has a public IP address.

5. Confirm the changes by running the following command:

```
gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
```

6. Verify that the instance no longer has a public IP address in the output.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Database Instances Should Not Have Public IPs" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of having public IPs on database instances in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Identify the database instances that have public IPs assigned to them.
   - You can use the `google-cloud-sdk` command `gcloud sql instances list` to list all the database instances in your project.
   - Then, you can check the `ipAddresses` field of each instance to see if it has a public IP assigned to it.

2. Update the network settings of the database instances to remove the public IP.
   - You can use the `google-cloud-sdk` command `gcloud sql instances patch` to update the network settings of the instance.
   - Set the `authorized-networks` parameter to the list of CIDR blocks that are allowed to access the instance.
   - Set the `require-ssl` parameter to enforce SSL connections to the instance.

3. Verify that the public IP has been removed from the database instance.
   - You can use the `google-cloud-sdk` command `gcloud sql instances describe` to check the network settings of the instance.
   - Verify that the `ipAddresses` field does not contain a public IP address.

Here's a sample Python script that performs these steps:

```python
from google.cloud import sql_v1beta4
from google.auth import compute_engine

# Authenticate using the default credentials
credentials = compute_engine.Credentials()

# Create a client to interact with the Cloud SQL API
client = sql_v1beta4.CloudSqlInstancesServiceClient(credentials=credentials)

# List all the database instances in the project
project_id = "my-project"
instances = client.list(project_id=project_id)

# Iterate over the instances and update their network settings
for instance in instances:
    # Check if the instance has a public IP address
    if instance.ip_addresses and instance.ip_addresses[0].ip_address_type == sql_v1beta4.SqlIpAddressType.PUBLIC:
        # Update the instance's network settings to remove the public IP
        update_mask = sql_v1beta4.field_mask.FieldMask(paths=["settings.ipConfiguration.authorizedNetworks", "settings.ipConfiguration.requireSsl"])
        instance.settings.ip_configuration.authorized_networks = []
        instance.settings.ip_configuration.require_ssl = True
        request = sql_v1beta4.SqlInstancesPatchRequest(instance=instance, update_mask=update_mask)
        response = client.patch(request=request)

        # Verify that the public IP has been removed
        updated_instance = client.get(request=sql_v1beta4.SqlInstancesGetRequest(instance=instance.name))
        if updated_instance.ip_addresses and updated_instance.ip_addresses[0].ip_address_type == sql_v1beta4.SqlIpAddressType.PUBLIC:
            print(f"Failed to remove public IP from instance {instance.name}")
        else:
            print(f"Removed public IP from instance {instance.name}")
```

Note: This script uses the `google-cloud-sql` library to interact with the Cloud SQL API. You can install it using `pip install google-cloud-sql`. Also, make sure that the service account used by the script has the necessary permissions to update the network settings of the database instances.
