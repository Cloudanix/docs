### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console: Navigate to the GCP Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your GCP account. If you don't have an account, you'll need to create one.

2. Navigate to SQL: From the navigation menu, select "SQL" under the "Storage" section. This will take you to the SQL section where you can see all your SQL instances.

3. Check Instance Details: Click on the name of the SQL instance you want to check. This will open the instance details page. 

4. Check Public Accessibility: Under the "Connections" tab, look for the "Public IP" section. If the "Authorized networks" field has any entries, this means that the SQL instance is publicly accessible. If this field is empty, the SQL instance is not publicly accessible.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate the Google Cloud SDK CLI: You need to have the Google Cloud SDK installed on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website. After installation, authenticate the SDK using the command `gcloud auth login`. This will open a new browser window where you can log in with your Google account.

2. List all SQL instances: Use the `gcloud sql instances list` command to list all SQL instances in your project. This command will return a list of all SQL instances along with their details.

3. Check the `settings.ipConfiguration.ipv4Enabled` field: For each SQL instance, use the `gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]` command to get detailed information about the instance. In the output, look for the `settings.ipConfiguration.ipv4Enabled` field. If this field is set to `True`, then the SQL instance is publicly accessible.

4. Check the `settings.ipConfiguration.authorizedNetworks` field: In the same output, also check the `settings.ipConfiguration.authorizedNetworks` field. If this field contains `0.0.0.0/0`, then the SQL instance is accessible from any IP address, which is a potential security risk.

Here is an example of how to check these fields for a SQL instance named `my-instance`:

```
gcloud sql instances describe my-instance --format="get(settings.ipConfiguration.ipv4Enabled,settings.ipConfiguration.authorizedNetworks)"
```

This command will return the values of the `ipv4Enabled` and `authorizedNetworks` fields for `my-instance`.

#### Using Python

1. AWS RDS:
   - Install the AWS SDK (boto3) for Python using pip.
   - Use the `describe_db_instances()` function to retrieve the details of all DB instances.
   - Check the `PubliclyAccessible` attribute for each DB instance. If it's set to `True`, the DB instance is publicly accessible.
   - Python script:
     ```python
     import boto3
     client = boto3.client('rds')
     response = client.describe_db_instances()
     for instance in response['DBInstances']:
         if instance['PubliclyAccessible']:
             print(f"DB instance {instance['DBInstanceIdentifier']} is publicly accessible.")
     ```

2. Azure SQL Database:
   - Install the Azure SDK for Python using pip.
   - Use the `servers.get()` function to retrieve the details of a SQL server.
   - Check the `public_network_access` attribute for the server. If it's set to `Enabled`, the server is publicly accessible.
   - Python script:
     ```python
     from azure.mgmt.sql import SqlManagementClient
     from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
     credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
     sql_client = SqlManagementClient(credential, '<subscription_id>')
     server = sql_client.servers.get('<resource_group_name>', '<server_name>')
     if server.public_network_access == 'Enabled':
         print(f"SQL server {server.name} is publicly accessible.")
     ```

3. Google Cloud SQL:
   - Install the Google Cloud SDK for Python using pip.
   - Use the `instances().get()` function to retrieve the details of a SQL instance.
   - Check the `settings.ipConfiguration.ipv4Enabled` attribute for the instance. If it's set to `True`, the instance is publicly accessible.
   - Python script:
     ```python
     from googleapiclient import discovery
     from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials
     credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
     service = discovery.build('sqladmin', 'v1beta4', credentials=credentials)
     response = service.instances().get(project='<project_id>', instance='<instance_id>').execute()
     if response['settings']['ipConfiguration']['ipv4Enabled']:
         print(f"SQL instance {response['name']} is publicly accessible.")
     ```

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step by step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "DB Instances Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" for GCP using GCP console:

1. Open the GCP Console and select the project where the misconfiguration exists.
2. Navigate to the Cloud SQL instances page.
3. Select the instance that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
5. Scroll down to the "Public IP" section and select "No" for the "Public IP" option.
6. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page to apply the changes.

After following these steps, the public IP address of the instance will be removed and the instance will no longer be publicly accessible.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of DB Instances being publicly accessible in GCP using GCP CLI, follow the steps below:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.

2. Run the following command to list all the Cloud SQL instances in your project:

```gcloud sql instances list```

3. Identify the instance that is publicly accessible and note down its instance name.

4. Run the following command to update the instance's settings and make it private:

```gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME --assign-ip```

Replace INSTANCE_NAME with the name of the instance that you noted down in step 3.

5. Confirm the changes by running the following command:

```gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME```

Replace INSTANCE_NAME with the name of the instance that you noted down in step 3.

6. Verify that the "ipConfiguration.authorizedNetworks" field is set to "private" in the output of the above command.

Once you have completed the above steps, the DB instance will no longer be publicly accessible and can only be accessed from authorized networks.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "DB Instances Should Not Be Publicly Accessible" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Create a service account with the required permissions to access the Cloud SQL instance.

Step 2: Install the Python client library for Cloud SQL using the following command:

```
pip install google-cloud-sql
```

Step 3: Use the following Python code to update the instance settings to disable public IP access:

```python
from google.cloud import sql_v1beta4
from google.oauth2 import service_account

# Set the instance name and project ID
instance_name = 'INSTANCE_NAME'
project_id = 'PROJECT_ID'

# Path to the service account key file
key_path = 'PATH_TO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE'

# Create credentials object from the key file
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    key_path,
    scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"],
)

# Create the Cloud SQL admin client
client = sql_v1beta4.SqlInstancesServiceClient(credentials=credentials)

# Get the current settings for the instance
instance = client.get(project=project_id, instance=instance_name)

# Update the instance settings to disable public IP access
settings = instance.settings
settings.ip_configuration.authorized_networks.clear()
settings.ip_configuration.require_ssl = True
settings.ip_configuration.ipv4_enabled = False
settings.ip_configuration.private_network = 'default'
settings.ip_configuration.require_ssl = True

# Apply the updated settings to the instance
update_mask = sql_v1beta4.field_mask.FieldMask(paths=[
    'settings.ip_configuration.authorized_networks',
    'settings.ip_configuration.ipv4_enabled',
    'settings.ip_configuration.private_network',
    'settings.ip_configuration.require_ssl'
])
operation = client.patch(project=project_id, instance=instance_name, instance=instance, update_mask=update_mask)

# Wait for the operation to complete
operation.result()
```

Note: Replace `INSTANCE_NAME`, `PROJECT_ID`, and `PATH_TO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE` with the appropriate values for your environment.

This code will update the Cloud SQL instance settings to disable public IP access and require SSL encryption for all connections.
