### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console: Navigate to the GCP console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google account. If you don't have an account, you'll need to create one.

2. Navigate to SQL Instances: From the GCP console dashboard, select the hamburger menu in the upper left-hand corner. Scroll down and click on "SQL" under the "Storage" section. This will take you to the SQL instances page where you can see all your SQL instances.

3. Select the SQL instance: Click on the name of the SQL instance you want to check. This will take you to the instance details page.

4. Check the flag: From the instance details page, click on the "Configuration" tab. Scroll down to the "Flags" section. Look for the "skip_show_database" flag. If it's not listed, it means the flag is off. If it is listed, check its value. If the value is 'ON', it means the MySQL Skip Show Database Flag is enabled. If the value is 'OFF', it means it's disabled.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, you can authenticate your Google Cloud account by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. After you have authenticated your account, you can list all the SQL instances in your project by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances list
   ```

3. Choose the SQL instance that you want to check and describe its configuration by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of your SQL instance.

4. In the output of the previous command, look for the `databaseFlags` field. If the `skip_show_database` flag is set to `ON`, then the MySQL Skip Show Database Flag is on. If the flag is not present or set to `OFF`, then it is off. The output should look something like this:

   ```
   databaseFlags:
   - name: skip_show_database
     value: 'ON'
   ```

   If the `skip_show_database` flag is not present in the `databaseFlags` field, then it is off.

#### Using Python

To check if the MySQL Skip Show Database Flag is on using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Establish a Connection to the MySQL Server:**
   You need to establish a connection to the MySQL server using the `mysql.connector` module in Python. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   import mysql.connector

   try:
       connection = mysql.connector.connect(host='hostname',
                                            database='database',
                                            user='username',
                                            password='password')
       if connection.is_connected():
           db_Info = connection.get_server_info()
           print("Connected to MySQL Server version ", db_Info)
   except Error as e:
       print("Error while connecting to MySQL", e)
   ```

2. **Execute a Query to Check the Flag:**
   Once the connection is established, you can execute a query to check the status of the 'skip_show_database' flag. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   cursor = connection.cursor()
   cursor.execute("SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'skip_show_database';")
   result = cursor.fetchone()
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Parse the Result:**
   The result of the query will be a tuple where the first element is the name of the variable and the second element is its value. You can parse this result to check if the flag is on. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   if result[1] == 'ON':
       print("The 'skip_show_database' flag is ON.")
   else:
       print("The 'skip_show_database' flag is OFF.")
   ```

4. **Close the Connection:**
   Finally, you should close the connection to the MySQL server. Here is a sample script:

   ```python
   if connection.is_connected():
       cursor.close()
       connection.close()
       print("MySQL connection is closed")
   ```

Please replace 'hostname', 'database', 'username', and 'password' with your actual MySQL server details.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the MySQL Skip Show Database Flag Should Be On misconfiguration for GCP using GCP console, please follow these steps:

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console and select your project.
2. In the left-hand menu, select "SQL" under the "Storage" section.
3. Select the instance that you want to remediate.
4. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
5. Scroll down to the "Flags" section and click on the "Add item" button.
6. In the "Name" field, enter "skip_show_database".
7. In the "Value" field, enter "ON".
8. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page.

Once you have completed these steps, the MySQL Skip Show Database Flag will be set to "ON" for your GCP instance, and the misconfiguration will be remediated.

#### Using CLI

The "skip-show-database" flag in MySQL allows users to prevent the display of the list of all databases when the "SHOW DATABASES" command is executed. However, it is recommended to keep this flag turned off for security reasons. 

To remediate this misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.
2. Connect to your MySQL instance using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql connect INSTANCE_NAME --user=root
   ```

   Replace INSTANCE_NAME with the name of your MySQL instance.

3. Enter your MySQL root password when prompted.
4. Execute the following command to edit the MySQL configuration file:

   ```
   sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
   ```

5. Find the line that contains "skip-show-database" and comment it out by adding a "#" symbol at the beginning of the line.
6. Save the changes by pressing "Ctrl + O" and then "Ctrl + X" to exit the editor.
7. Restart the MySQL service using the following command:

   ```
   sudo service mysql restart
   ```

8. Verify that the "skip-show-database" flag is now turned off by executing the following command:

   ```
   SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'skip_show_database';
   ```

   The output should be "skip_show_database | OFF".

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the "MySQL Skip Show Database Flag Should Be On" misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the MySQL Skip Show Database Flag misconfiguration in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. First, connect to the Cloud SQL instance using the Cloud SQL Admin API. You can use the `google-auth` and `google-cloud-sql` libraries for this.

```python
from google.auth import compute_engine
from google.cloud.sql.connector import connector

# Set the instance properties
INSTANCE_NAME = 'your-instance-name'
CREDENTIALS = compute_engine.Credentials()

# Connect to the instance
conn = connector.connect(
    INSTANCE_NAME,
    'pymysql',
    user='your-username',
    password='your-password',
    db='your-database',
    unix_socket='/cloudsql/{}'.format(INSTANCE_NAME),
    cursorclass=connector.cursor.DictCursor,
    autocommit=True,
    credentials=CREDENTIALS
)
```

2. Once you are connected to the instance, execute the following SQL command to set the `skip_show_database` flag to `ON`.

```python
with conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SET GLOBAL skip_show_database=ON")
```

3. Verify that the flag has been set correctly by executing the following SQL command.

```python
with conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'skip_show_database'")
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    print(result)
```

This should output a dictionary containing the name and value of the `skip_show_database` flag.

That's it! You have successfully remediated the MySQL Skip Show Database Flag misconfiguration in GCP using Python.
