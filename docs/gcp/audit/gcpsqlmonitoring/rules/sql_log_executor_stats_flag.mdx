<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the PostgreSQL Log Executor Stats flag issue for GCP using the GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP console and go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
2. Select the instance that you want to remediate.
3. Click on the Edit button at the top of the page.
4. Scroll down to the Flags section and locate the `log_executor_stats` flag.
5. If the flag is set to `on`, click on the X button to remove it.
6. Click on the Save button at the bottom of the page to apply the changes.

After following these steps, the PostgreSQL Log Executor Stats flag will be turned off, and the misconfiguration will be remediated.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the PostgreSQL Log Executor Stats flag being on in GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.

2. Run the following command to connect to your instance: 

   `gcloud sql connect [INSTANCE_NAME] --user=postgres`

   Replace [INSTANCE_NAME] with the name of your PostgreSQL instance.

3. Enter the password for the postgres user when prompted.

4. Once connected, run the following command to check the current value of the log_executor_stats flag: 

   `SHOW log_executor_stats;`

5. If the value is "on", run the following command to turn it off: 

   `ALTER SYSTEM SET log_executor_stats = off;`

6. Finally, run the following command to reload the configuration: 

   `SELECT pg_reload_conf();`

7. Verify that the log_executor_stats flag is now off by running the following command: 

   `SHOW log_executor_stats;`

   The output should show "off".

You have now successfully remediated the PostgreSQL Log Executor Stats flag being on in GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the PostgreSQL Log Executor Stats Flag Should Be Off misconfiguration in GCP using python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to authenticate and authorize your python script to access the GCP project where the PostgreSQL instance is running. You can use the `google-auth` and `google-cloud-secret-manager` packages to achieve this.

2. Once you have authenticated and authorized your script, you can use the `google-cloud-sql` package to get the list of all the PostgreSQL instances in the project.

3. After getting the list of instances, you can iterate through each instance and check if the `log_executor_stats` flag is set to `on` or not. You can use the `psycopg2` package to connect to the instance and execute the following SQL query to get the value of the flag:

```
SELECT name, setting FROM pg_settings WHERE name = 'log_executor_stats';
```

4. If the flag is set to `on`, you can execute the following SQL query to turn it off:

```
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_executor_stats = off;
```

5. Once you have turned off the flag, you need to reload the PostgreSQL configuration by executing the following SQL query:

```
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

6. Finally, you can log the remediation action and move on to the next instance.

Here's a sample python script that you can use to remediate the PostgreSQL Log Executor Stats Flag Should Be Off misconfiguration in GCP:

```
from google.cloud import secretmanager
from google.cloud import sql
import psycopg2

# Authenticate and authorize the script to access the GCP project
# ...

# Get the list of all PostgreSQL instances in the project
client = sql.Client()
instances = client.list_instances()

# Iterate through each instance and remediate the misconfiguration
for instance in instances:
    if instance.database_version.startswith('POSTGRES'):
        # Connect to the instance and get the value of the log_executor_stats flag
        conn = psycopg2.connect(
            host=instance.ip_addresses[0].ip_address,
            user=instance.service_account_email,
            password=instance.database_password,
            database='postgres'
        )
        cur = conn.cursor()
        cur.execute("SELECT name, setting FROM pg_settings WHERE name = 'log_executor_stats';")
        name, setting = cur.fetchone()

        # If the flag is set to on, turn it off and reload the configuration
        if setting == 'on':
            cur.execute("ALTER SYSTEM SET log_executor_stats = off;")
            cur.execute("SELECT pg_reload_conf();")
            conn.commit()

            # Log the remediation action
            print(f"Remediated log_executor_stats flag for instance {instance.name}")
        
        cur.close()
        conn.close()
```

Note: This script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to access the PostgreSQL instances and modify their configurations. Please make sure to test the script in a non-production environment before running it in production.
