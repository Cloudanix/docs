### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform web console and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to SQL Instances: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner). Scroll down and click on "SQL" under the "Storage" section. This will take you to the SQL instances page.

3. Check SQL Instances: Here, you will see a list of all your SQL instances. For each instance, you can see its details including the instance ID, database version, location, and configuration. Check the "Configuration" column to determine the type of each SQL instance.

4. Verify Instance Type: Compare the instance types with your desired instance type. If any of the instances are not of the desired type, then there is a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate the Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine and authenticate it. You can download the SDK from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, you can authenticate it by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   This command will open a new window in your web browser asking you to log in with your Google account. Once logged in, your SDK will be authenticated.

2. List all SQL instances: Once the SDK is authenticated, you can list all SQL instances in your project by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all SQL instances in your project, along with their details such as instance name, region, tier, and status.

3. Check the instance type: To check the type of a specific SQL instance, you can use the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
   ```
   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of the SQL instance you want to check. This command will return detailed information about the specified SQL instance, including its type.

4. Analyze the output: The output of the previous command will include a field named "tier". This field indicates the type of the SQL instance. You can compare this value with your desired instance type to determine if the instance is of the desired type. If the value of the "tier" field matches your desired instance type, then the instance is of the desired type. If not, then the instance is not of the desired type.

#### Using Python

To determine if SQL instances provisioned are of the desired type in SQL using Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install the necessary libraries**: You will need the `google-cloud-sql` library to interact with Google Cloud SQL instances. You can install it using pip:
   ```python
   pip install google-cloud-sql
   ```

2. **Authenticate your application**: Before you can interact with GCP resources, you need to authenticate your application. You can do this by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key file.
   ```python
   import os
   os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"]="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
   ```

3. **Initialize the SQL Admin Service**: You can use the `googleapiclient.discovery` module to create a service object that you can use to interact with the SQL Admin API.
   ```python
   from googleapiclient import discovery
   service = discovery.build('sqladmin', 'v1beta4')
   ```

4. **List and check the SQL instances**: You can use the `instances().list()` method to get a list of all SQL instances in your project. Then, you can iterate over this list and check the `databaseVersion` and `settings.instanceType` properties of each instance to determine if they are of the desired type.
   ```python
   instances = service.instances().list(project='your-project-id').execute()
   for instance in instances['items']:
       if instance['databaseVersion'] != 'DESIRED_DATABASE_VERSION' or instance['settings']['instanceType'] != 'DESIRED_INSTANCE_TYPE':
           print(f"Instance {instance['name']} is not of the desired type.")
   ```

Replace `'DESIRED_DATABASE_VERSION'` and `'DESIRED_INSTANCE_TYPE'` with the database version and instance type you want to check for. If an instance is not of the desired type, the script will print its name.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

The following are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "Determine SQL Instances Provisioned are of Desired Type" for GCP using GCP console:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the SQL Instances page.

2. Identify the SQL instances that are not of the desired type.

3. Click on the name of the SQL instance that needs to be remediated.

4. In the Instance details page, click on the Edit button at the top of the page.

5. In the Edit page, scroll down to the Configuration Options section.

6. In the Configuration Options section, select the desired SQL type from the drop-down menu.

7. Click on the Save button at the bottom of the page to save the changes.

8. Repeat the above steps for all the SQL instances that are not of the desired type.

9. Verify that all the SQL instances are now of the desired type by checking the Instance details page for each SQL instance.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Determine SQL Instances Provisioned are of Desired Type" for GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

The first step in remediating this misconfiguration is to identify all the SQL instances that are currently provisioned in your GCP environment and verify that they are of the desired type. Follow these steps to remediate this issue using the GCP CLI:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP account.
2. Run the following command to list all the SQL instances in your project:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances list
   ```

3. Review the output from the above command to identify the SQL instances that are currently provisioned in your project.
4. Run the following command to describe a specific SQL instance:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME
   ```

   Replace INSTANCE_NAME with the name of the SQL instance that you want to describe.

5. Review the output from the above command to verify that the SQL instance is of the desired type.

If you find that any SQL instances are not of the desired type, you will need to create a new instance of the desired type and migrate your data to the new instance. Here are the steps to create a new SQL instance:

1. Run the following command to create a new SQL instance:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances create NEW_INSTANCE_NAME --tier=TIER --region=REGION
   ```

   Replace NEW_INSTANCE_NAME with a unique name for the new SQL instance, TIER with the desired tier (e.g. db-n1-standard-2) and REGION with the desired region (e.g. us-central1).

2. Run the following command to set the root password for the new SQL instance:

   ```
   gcloud sql users set-password root --host % --instance=NEW_INSTANCE_NAME --password=NEW_PASSWORD
   ```

   Replace NEW_INSTANCE_NAME with the name of the new SQL instance and NEW_PASSWORD with a strong password for the root user.

3. Run the following command to create a new database in the new SQL instance:

   ```
   gcloud sql databases create NEW_DATABASE_NAME --instance=NEW_INSTANCE_NAME
   ```

   Replace NEW_INSTANCE_NAME with the name of the new SQL instance and NEW_DATABASE_NAME with a unique name for the new database.

4. Finally, you will need to migrate your data from the old SQL instance to the new SQL instance. You can use the Cloud SQL Admin API or a third-party tool to perform the migration. Once the migration is complete, you can delete the old SQL instance using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances delete OLD_INSTANCE_NAME
   ```

   Replace OLD_INSTANCE_NAME with the name of the old SQL instance.

#### Using Python

The misconfiguration "Determine SQL Instances Provisioned are of Desired Type" in GCP can be remediated using the following steps in Python:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

2. Create a service account and authenticate using the JSON key file:

```python
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/key.json')
```

3. Set the project ID and create a BigQuery client:

```python
project_id = 'your-project-id'
client = bigquery.Client(project=project_id, credentials=credentials)
```

4. Define the query to check for SQL instances that are not of the desired type:

```python
query = """
SELECT
  project_id,
  name,
  settings.database_version
FROM
  `your-project-id`.region-us-central1.sqladmin.instances
WHERE
  settings.database_version != 'MYSQL_5_7'
  AND settings.database_version != 'POSTGRES_9_6'
"""
```

5. Run the query and check the results:

```python
query_job = client.query(query)

if query_job.result():
  print('There are SQL instances that are not of the desired type.')
  for row in query_job:
    print(f"Project ID: {row.project_id}, Instance Name: {row.name}, Database Version: {row.settings.database_version}")
else:
  print('All SQL instances are of the desired type.')
```

6. If there are instances that are not of the desired type, you can update them using the Cloud SQL API:

```python
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/key.json')

service = build('sqladmin', 'v1beta4', credentials=credentials)

project_id = 'your-project-id'
instance_name = 'your-instance-name'
instance_type = 'MYSQL_5_7' # or 'POSTGRES_9_6'

request = service.instances().patch(
    project=project_id,
    instance=instance_name,
    body={
        'settings': {
            'databaseVersion': instance_type
        }
    }
)

response = request.execute()
```

Note: Make sure to replace 'path/to/key.json', 'your-project-id', 'your-instance-name', 'MYSQL_5_7', and 'POSTGRES_9_6' with the correct values for your environment.
