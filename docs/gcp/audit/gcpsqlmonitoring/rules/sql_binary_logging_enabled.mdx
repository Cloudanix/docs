To remediate the issue "SQL Instances Should Have Binary Logging Enabled" for GCP using GCP console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to the Google Cloud Console.
2. In the Navigation menu, select "SQL" under the "DATABASES" section.
3. Select the instance for which you want to enable binary logging.
4. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
5. Scroll down to the "Configuration options" section.
6. Under the "Replication" tab, select "Enable binary logging".
7. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page.

Once the above steps are completed, binary logging will be enabled for the selected SQL instance in GCP.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "SQL Instances Should Have Binary Logging Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in GCP console.

2. Run the following command to list all the SQL instances in your project:

```
gcloud sql instances list
```

3. Identify the SQL instance for which you want to enable binary logging.

4. Run the following command to enable binary logging for the identified SQL instance:

```
gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME --enable-bin-log
```

Replace `INSTANCE_NAME` with the name of the SQL instance for which you want to enable binary logging.

5. Verify that binary logging is enabled for the SQL instance by running the following command:

```
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME
```

This command will display the configuration details of the SQL instance, including the binary logging status.

6. Repeat the above steps for all the SQL instances in your project to ensure that binary logging is enabled for all of them.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "SQL Instances Should Have Binary Logging Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "SQL Instances Should Have Binary Logging Enabled" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to enable binary logging for the Cloud SQL instance. You can use the Cloud SQL Admin API to enable binary logging. Use the following code to enable binary logging for the Cloud SQL instance:

```python
from googleapiclient import discovery
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials

# Set the project ID and instance name
project_id = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
instance_name = 'YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME'

# Authenticate and construct the service object
credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
service = discovery.build('sqladmin', 'v1beta4', credentials=credentials)

# Enable binary logging for the Cloud SQL instance
request = service.instances().patch(
    project=project_id,
    instance=instance_name,
    body={
        'settings': {
            'settingsVersion': '1',
            'databaseFlags': [
                {
                    'name': 'binlog_enabled',
                    'value': 'on'
                }
            ]
        }
    }
)
response = request.execute()
```

2. Once you have enabled binary logging for the Cloud SQL instance, you need to verify that it has been enabled. You can use the following code to verify that binary logging has been enabled:

```python
# Get the Cloud SQL instance details
request = service.instances().get(
    project=project_id,
    instance=instance_name
)
response = request.execute()

# Check if binary logging is enabled
if 'databaseFlags' in response['settings']:
    for flag in response['settings']['databaseFlags']:
        if flag['name'] == 'binlog_enabled' and flag['value'] == 'on':
            print('Binary logging is enabled for the Cloud SQL instance.')
            break
else:
    print('Binary logging is not enabled for the Cloud SQL instance.')
```

3. Finally, you need to automate the remediation process so that it can be applied to multiple Cloud SQL instances. You can use the following code to retrieve a list of Cloud SQL instances and enable binary logging for each one:

```python
# Get a list of Cloud SQL instances
request = service.instances().list(project=project_id)
response = request.execute()

# Loop through each Cloud SQL instance and enable binary logging
for instance in response['items']:
    instance_name = instance['name']
    request = service.instances().patch(
        project=project_id,
        instance=instance_name,
        body={
            'settings': {
                'settingsVersion': '1',
                'databaseFlags': [
                    {
                        'name': 'binlog_enabled',
                        'value': 'on'
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    )
    response = request.execute()
```

Note: Before executing the above code, make sure to replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` and `YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME` with your actual project ID and Cloud SQL instance name, respectively.
