### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to KMS Keys: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner), scroll down and click on "Security" then click on "Key Management". This will take you to the KMS Keys page where you can see all the keys that have been created in your GCP account.

3. Check for Unique Keys in DB Tier: Here, you need to manually check each key to ensure that it is unique for the DB tier. Click on each key to view its details. Check the "Key ring" and "Key" fields to ensure that they are unique for each DB tier. 

4. Use Filter: You can also use the filter option to narrow down the keys related to the DB tier. Enter the DB tier name in the filter box and press enter. This will display only the keys related to the DB tier, making it easier for you to check for uniqueness. 

Remember, this process needs to be repeated for each project in your GCP account as KMS keys are managed at the project level.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK (if not already done). You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and initialize it using the command `gcloud init`.

2. Once the SDK is set up, you can list all the keys in the Key Management Service (KMS) using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud kms keys list --location global --keyring [KEYRING_NAME]
   ```
   Replace `[KEYRING_NAME]` with the name of your keyring. This command will list all the keys in the specified keyring.

3. To check the details of each key, use the following command:
   ```
   gcloud kms keys describe [KEY_NAME] --location global --keyring [KEYRING_NAME]
   ```
   Replace `[KEY_NAME]` with the name of your key and `[KEYRING_NAME]` with the name of your keyring. This command will display the details of the specified key.

4. Now, you need to manually check if the same key is being used in the DB tier. This can be done by comparing the key details with the keys used in your DB tier. If the same key is being used, it means that the KMS key is not unique in the DB tier.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, you need to install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS services. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating the files ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config:

   ~/.aws/credentials:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

   ~/.aws/config:
   ```
   [default]
   region=us-east-1
   ```

3. Write a Python script to list all KMS keys and check if they are unique in DB tier:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_unique_kms_keys():
       client = boto3.client('kms')
       response = client.list_keys()

       kms_keys = response['Keys']
       db_tier_keys = [key for key in kms_keys if 'db' in key['KeyArn']]

       if len(db_tier_keys) != len(set(db_tier_keys)):
           print("KMS Key is not unique in DB tier")
       else:
           print("KMS Key is unique in DB tier")

   check_unique_kms_keys()
   ```

   This script first lists all KMS keys. Then it filters out the keys that are used in the DB tier (assuming the 'db' string is present in their ARN). Finally, it checks if all keys in the DB tier are unique.

4. Run the Python script: You can run the script using the Python interpreter:

   ```
   python check_kms_keys.py
   ```

   The script will print whether the KMS key is unique in the DB tier or not.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the KMS Key Should Have Unique Key In DB Tier misconfiguration in GCP using GCP Console, please follow the steps below:

1. Login to the GCP Console and navigate to the Cloud KMS page.
2. Select the key ring that contains the KMS key that is used in the DB tier.
3. Click on the KMS key that is used in the DB tier.
4. Click on the "Permissions" tab.
5. Check if there are any unnecessary or redundant IAM roles or members that have access to the KMS key.
6. Remove any unnecessary or redundant IAM roles or members by clicking on the "X" button next to their names.
7. Click on the "Add Member" button to add a new member to the KMS key.
8. Add the service account that is used by the DB tier to the KMS key and grant it the "Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter" role.
9. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

By following the above steps, you will ensure that the KMS key used in the DB tier has a unique key and is only accessible by the necessary service account.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "KMS Key Should Have Unique Key In DB Tier" in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Identify the KMS key associated with the DB tier. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud kms keys list --location=<location> --keyring=<keyring>
   ```

   Replace `<location>` and `<keyring>` with the location and keyring name where the KMS key is stored.

2. Check if the KMS key is associated with the DB tier by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe <instance-name> --format=json | jq '.settings.settingsVersion' | grep -q kmsKeyName
   ```

   Replace `<instance-name>` with the name of the Cloud SQL instance.

3. If the KMS key is associated with the DB tier, create a new KMS key and associate it with the DB tier. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   gcloud kms keyrings create <keyring-name> --location=<location>
   gcloud kms keys create <kms-key-name> --location=<location> --keyring=<keyring-name> --purpose=encryption
   gcloud sql instances patch <instance-name> --backup-configuration kms-key-name=projects/<project-id>/locations/<location>/keyRings/<keyring-name>/cryptoKeys/<kms-key-name>
   ```

   Replace `<keyring-name>`, `<location>`, `<kms-key-name>`, `<instance-name>`, and `<project-id>` with appropriate values.

4. Verify that the new KMS key is associated with the DB tier by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud sql instances describe <instance-name> --format=json | jq '.settings.settingsVersion' | grep -q <kms-key-name>
   ```

   Replace `<instance-name>` and `<kms-key-name>` with appropriate values.

Once you have completed the above steps, the misconfiguration "KMS Key Should Have Unique Key In DB Tier" will be remediated for GCP.

#### Using Python

To remediate the KMS Key Should Have Unique Key In DB Tier misconfiguration in GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to identify the KMS key used in the DB tier. You can do this by checking the configuration of your database instance and looking for the KMS key used for encryption.

2. Next, you need to check if the KMS key is unique. You can do this by querying the Cloud KMS API for a list of all the KMS keys in your project and checking if the key used in the DB tier is unique.

3. If the KMS key is not unique, you need to create a new KMS key and update the configuration of your database instance to use the new key. You can use the Cloud KMS API to create a new key and update the configuration of your database instance using the Cloud SQL Admin API.

Here's an example Python code that you can use to create a new KMS key and update the configuration of your database instance:

```
import google.auth
from google.cloud import kms_v1
from google.cloud.sql_v1beta4 import SqlInstancesServiceClient
from google.cloud.sql_v1beta4.types import SqlInstancesSetBackupEncryptionRequest

# Authenticate using the default credentials
credentials, project_id = google.auth.default()

# Create a KMS client
kms_client = kms_v1.KeyManagementServiceClient(credentials=credentials)

# Create a new KMS key
key_name = kms_client.key_ring_path(project_id, 'my-key-ring', 'my-key')
key = kms_client.create_crypto_key(key_name, kms_v1.CryptoKey.CryptoKeyPurpose.ENCRYPT_DECRYPT)

# Update the configuration of your database instance to use the new key
instance_client = SqlInstancesServiceClient(credentials=credentials)
instance_name = 'projects/{}/instances/{}'.format(project_id, 'my-instance')
encryption_config = {
    'kms_key_name': key_name,
}
request = SqlInstancesSetBackupEncryptionRequest(
    instance=instance_name,
    project=project_id,
    body={
        'encryptionConfig': encryption_config,
    }
)
instance_client.set_backup_encryption(request=request)
```

Note: This is just an example code and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Also, make sure to test the code in a non-production environment before applying it to your production environment.
