### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, visit the Google Cloud Platform Console, and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to KMS Keys: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner). Scroll down and click on "Security" then select "Key Management" under the Identity & Security section.

3. Check for Unique Keys: In the Key Management section, you will see a list of all your KMS keys. Check if there are any duplicate keys in the web tier. Each key should be unique and associated with a specific service or application in the web tier.

4. Review Key Details: Click on each key to view its details. Ensure that the key is not being used by multiple services or applications in the web tier. The key's "Use details" section should provide information about its usage.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK. If you haven't done this yet, you can follow the instructions provided by Google Cloud's official documentation.

2. Once the SDK is installed and initialized, open your terminal or command prompt. Use the following command to list all the keys in the Key Management Service (KMS):

   ```
   gcloud kms keys list --location global --keyring [KEYRING_NAME]
   ```
   Replace `[KEYRING_NAME]` with the name of your keyring.

3. To check the details of each key, use the following command:

   ```
   gcloud kms keys describe [KEY_NAME] --location global --keyring [KEYRING_NAME]
   ```
   Replace `[KEY_NAME]` and `[KEYRING_NAME]` with the name of your key and keyring respectively.

4. Review the output of the above command. Look for the "purpose" field in the output. If the purpose is "ENCRYPT_DECRYPT", it means the key is used for both encryption and decryption. If multiple keys in the web tier have the same purpose, it indicates a misconfiguration as each key in the web tier should have a unique purpose.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You will need 'boto3' for AWS, 'azure-mgmt-keyvault' for Azure, and 'google-cloud-kms' for GCP. You can install these using pip:

   ```python
   pip install boto3 azure-mgmt-keyvault google-cloud-kms
   ```

2. AWS: Use the 'boto3' library to list all the KMS keys and check if there are any duplicates in the web tier:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def check_kms_keys():
       client = boto3.client('kms')
       response = client.list_keys()
       keys = [key['KeyId'] for key in response['Keys']]
       if len(keys) != len(set(keys)):
           print("Duplicate KMS keys found in the web tier.")
       else:
           print("No duplicate KMS keys found in the web tier.")

   check_kms_keys()
   ```

3. Azure: Use the 'azure-mgmt-keyvault' library to list all the KMS keys and check if there are any duplicates in the web tier:

   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.keyvault import KeyVaultManagementClient
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

   def check_kms_keys():
       credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
       client = KeyVaultManagementClient(credential, "<your-subscription-id>")
       vaults = client.vaults.list()
       keys = [vault.properties.vault_uri for vault in vaults]
       if len(keys) != len(set(keys)):
           print("Duplicate KMS keys found in the web tier.")
       else:
           print("No duplicate KMS keys found in the web tier.")

   check_kms_keys()
   ```

4. GCP: Use the 'google-cloud-kms' library to list all the KMS keys and check if there are any duplicates in the web tier:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import kms

   def check_kms_keys():
       client = kms.KeyManagementServiceClient()
       parent = client.location_path('<your-project-id>', 'global')
       keys = [key.name for key in client.list_crypto_keys(parent)]
       if len(keys) != len(set(keys)):
           print("Duplicate KMS keys found in the web tier.")
       else:
           print("No duplicate KMS keys found in the web tier.")

   check_kms_keys()
   ```
   
Please replace `<your-project-id>` and `<your-subscription-id>` with your actual project and subscription IDs.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "KMS Key Should Have Unique Key In Web Tier" for GCP using GCP console, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to the GCP console using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) page.
3. Select the key that is being used in the web tier.
4. Click on the "Edit" button.
5. In the "Edit Key" panel, scroll down to the "Key Usage" section.
6. Under "Key Usage", select "Asymmetric Sign/Verify" as the key usage.
7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

This will remediate the misconfiguration by ensuring that the KMS key being used in the web tier has a unique key usage of "Asymmetric Sign/Verify". This will help to ensure that the key is being used for its intended purpose and is not being used for other purposes that could compromise its security.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "KMS Key Should Have Unique Key In Web Tier" for GCP, you can follow the below steps using GCP CLI:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to list all the KMS keys:
   
   ```
   gcloud kms keys list
   ```

3. Identify the KMS key that is being used in the web tier.

4. Run the following command to generate a new unique key for the KMS key:
   
   ```
   gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding [KEY_NAME] --location [LOCATION] --keyring [KEYRING_NAME] --member serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] --role roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter
   ```

   Replace the following values in the above command:
   
   - `[KEY_NAME]` with the name of the KMS key that is being used in the web tier.
   
   - `[LOCATION]` with the location of the KMS key.
   
   - `[KEYRING_NAME]` with the name of the keyring that contains the KMS key.
   
   - `[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]` with the email address of the service account that needs access to the KMS key.

5. Run the following command to remove the existing key from the web tier:
   
   ```
   gcloud compute instances add-metadata [INSTANCE_NAME] --metadata [KEY_NAME]=no-longer-used
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of the instance running the web tier, and `[KEY_NAME]` with the name of the KMS key being used in the web tier.

6. Run the following command to add the new key to the web tier:
   
   ```
   gcloud compute instances add-metadata [INSTANCE_NAME] --metadata [KEY_NAME]=[NEW_KEY_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of the instance running the web tier, `[KEY_NAME]` with the name of the KMS key being used in the web tier, and `[NEW_KEY_NAME]` with the name of the new key generated in step 4.

7. Verify that the new key is being used in the web tier by checking the application logs or testing the application.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "KMS Key Should Have Unique Key In Web Tier" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the KMS Key Should Have Unique Key misconfiguration in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to install the Google Cloud KMS Python library. You can install it using the following command:

   ```
   pip install google-cloud-kms
   ```

2. Next, you need to create a new KMS key ring and a new KMS key in your GCP project. You can use the following code to create a new key ring and key:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import kms_v1

   # Create a KMS client
   client = kms_v1.KeyManagementServiceClient()

   # Set the project ID and location
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   location = 'global'

   # Set the key ring name and key name
   key_ring_name = 'your-key-ring-name'
   key_name = 'your-key-name'

   # Create the key ring
   parent = client.location_path(project_id, location)
   key_ring = client.create_key_ring(parent, key_ring_name, {})

   # Create the key
   key = client.create_crypto_key(key_ring.name, key_name, kms_v1.CryptoKey.CryptoKeyPurpose.ENCRYPT_DECRYPT, {})
   ```

   Note: Replace `your-project-id`, `your-key-ring-name`, and `your-key-name` with your own values.

3. Once you have created the new KMS key, you need to update your web tier to use this key instead of any existing keys. You can use the following code to update your web tier:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1

   # Create a Compute Engine client
   client = compute_v1.InstancesClient()

   # Set the project ID and zone
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   zone = 'your-zone'

   # Set the instance name and network interface name
   instance_name = 'your-instance-name'
   network_interface_name = 'your-network-interface-name'

   # Get the instance
   instance = client.get(project_id, zone, instance_name)

   # Get the network interface
   network_interface = next(n for n in instance.network_interfaces if n.name == network_interface_name)

   # Get the metadata
   metadata = network_interface.metadata

   # Update the KMS key in the metadata
   metadata['kms-key'] = 'projects/{}/locations/{}/keyRings/{}/cryptoKeys/{}'.format(project_id, location, key_ring_name, key_name)

   # Update the instance with the new metadata
   client.update(project_id, zone, instance_name, {'metadata': metadata})
   ```

   Note: Replace `your-project-id`, `your-zone`, `your-instance-name`, `your-network-interface-name`, `location`, `your-key-ring-name`, and `your-key-name` with your own values.

4. Finally, you need to verify that the KMS key is being used correctly by your web tier. You can do this by testing your web tier with some sample data and verifying that the data is encrypted and decrypted correctly using the new KMS key.

By following these steps, you can remediate the KMS Key Should Have Unique Key misconfiguration in GCP using Python.
