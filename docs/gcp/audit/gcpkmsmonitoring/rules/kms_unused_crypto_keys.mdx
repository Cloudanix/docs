### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account that has the necessary permissions to view and manage Key Management Service (KMS) resources.

2. Navigate to the KMS Dashboard: From the main navigation menu, select "Security" then "Key Management". This will take you to the KMS dashboard where you can view and manage all your cryptographic keys and key rings.

3. Check for CMKs: In the KMS dashboard, you will see a list of all your key rings and the cryptographic keys within them. Look for any keys that are not Customer Master Keys (CMKs). CMKs are keys that you create in KMS and are used to encrypt and decrypt data directly or to manage other keys (such as data encryption keys).

4. Check Key Usage: For each key, check its "Purpose" and "Protection Level". A CMK should have a purpose of "Symmetric Encrypt Decrypt" or "Asymmetric Sign Verify" and a protection level of "Software" or "HSM". If a key does not meet these criteria, it may not be a CMK and could indicate a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, authenticate your Google Cloud account using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. Set your default project to the project you want to check for misconfigurations. Replace `PROJECT_ID` with your actual project ID:

   ```
   gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
   ```

3. List all the keys in the project using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud kms keys list --location global --keyring KEYRING_NAME
   ```
   Replace `KEYRING_NAME` with the name of your keyring.

4. Check if the keys are Customer Master Keys (CMKs). CMKs are keys that are created, owned, and managed by you. They are not automatically rotated by Google Cloud. If the keys listed in the previous step are not CMKs, then there is a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

To check if Customer Master Keys (CMKs) are being used in AWS Key Management Service (KMS), you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Here are the steps:

1. **Setup AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):**
   First, you need to install and configure Boto3. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install boto3
   ```
   Then, configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating the files ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   region=us-east-1
   ```

2. **List all CMKs:**
   Use the `list_keys` method to retrieve all CMKs. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a client
   kms = boto3.client('kms')

   # List keys
   response = kms.list_keys()

   # Print the key IDs
   for key in response['Keys']:
       print('Key ID:', key['KeyId'])
   ```

3. **Check the usage of each CMK:**
   For each CMK, use the `list_key_policies` method to retrieve the key policies, and then use the `get_key_policy` method to retrieve the policy document. If the policy document does not allow any usage, the CMK is not being used. Here is a sample script:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create a client
   kms = boto3.client('kms')

   # List keys
   response = kms.list_keys()

   # Check the usage of each key
   for key in response['Keys']:
       # List key policies
       policies = kms.list_key_policies(KeyId=key['KeyId'])

       # Check each policy
       for policy_name in policies['PolicyNames']:
           # Get the policy document
           policy = kms.get_key_policy(KeyId=key['KeyId'], PolicyName=policy_name)

           # Check if the policy allows any usage
           if 'Statement' in policy['Policy']:
               for statement in policy['Policy']['Statement']:
                   if statement['Effect'] == 'Allow' and 'Action' in statement and statement['Action']:
                       print('Key ID:', key['KeyId'], 'is being used')
                       break
   ```

4. **Interpret the results:**
   If the script prints that a key is being used, it means that the key has a policy that allows some actions. If the script does not print anything, it means that none of the keys are being used.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Customer Master Keys (CMKs) Should Be Used" for GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Console.
2. Navigate to the Cloud KMS page.
3. Click on "Create Key Ring" to create a new key ring.
4. Enter a name for the key ring and select the location where you want to create the key ring.
5. Click on "Create".
6. Navigate to the "Create Key" page.
7. Select the key ring that you created in step 4.
8. Enter a name for the key and select the key version.
9. Select the key algorithm and protection level.
10. Click on "Create".
11. Navigate to the "IAM" page.
12. Click on "Add Member" to add a new member to the project.
13. Enter the email address of the member and select the role that you want to assign to the member.
14. Click on "Save".

By following these steps, you have now created a new key ring, created a new key, and assigned a role to a member. You can now use this key to encrypt and decrypt data in GCP.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Customer Master Keys (CMKs) Should Be Used" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) page.

2. Create a new key ring and key for your project if you haven't already done so.

3. Use the following command to create a new symmetric key for your project:

   ```
   gcloud kms keys create <KEY-NAME> --location <LOCATION> --keyring <KEY-RING-NAME> --purpose encryption
   ```

   Replace `<KEY-NAME>`, `<LOCATION>`, and `<KEY-RING-NAME>` with the appropriate values for your project.

4. Use the following command to encrypt your data using the new key:

   ```
   gcloud kms encrypt --plaintext-file=<PLAINTEXT-FILE> --ciphertext-file=<CIPHERTEXT-FILE> --location=<LOCATION> --keyring=<KEY-RING-NAME> --key=<KEY-NAME>
   ```

   Replace `<PLAINTEXT-FILE>`, `<CIPHERTEXT-FILE>`, `<LOCATION>`, `<KEY-RING-NAME>`, and `<KEY-NAME>` with the appropriate values for your project.

5. Update your application or service to use the new encrypted data.

6. Verify that the new key is being used to encrypt and decrypt your data by checking the Cloud KMS audit logs.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Customer Master Keys (CMKs) Should Be Used" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Customer Master Keys (CMKs) Should Be Used" in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from googleapiclient import discovery
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials
```

2. Authenticate and create a client object:

```python
credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
service = discovery.build('cloudkms', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

3. List all the key rings:

```python
key_rings = service.projects().locations().keyRings().list(parent='projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION]').execute()
```

Note: Replace [PROJECT_ID] and [LOCATION] with your project ID and location respectively.

4. Loop through each key ring and list all the crypto keys:

```python
for key_ring in key_rings['keyRings']:
    crypto_keys = service.projects().locations().keyRings().cryptoKeys().list(parent=key_ring['name']).execute()
```

5. Check if the crypto key has a customer-managed encryption key:

```python
for crypto_key in crypto_keys['cryptoKeys']:
    if crypto_key['purpose'] == 'ENCRYPT_DECRYPT' and 'customerManagedEncryption' not in crypto_key:
        # Create a new customer-managed encryption key
        # Update the crypto key to use the new key
```

6. If the crypto key does not have a customer-managed encryption key, create a new one:

```python
key_ring_name = key_ring['name'].split('/')[-1]
location = key_ring['name'].split('/')[-3]
key_name = 'new-customer-key'

request_body = {
    'purpose': 'ENCRYPT_DECRYPT',
    'versionTemplate': {
        'algorithm': 'GOOGLE_SYMMETRIC_ENCRYPTION',
    },
    'encryptionAlgorithm': 'GOOGLE_SYMMETRIC_ENCRYPTION',
    'protectionLevel': 'SOFTWARE',
    'customerManagedEncryption': {
        'kmsKeyName': 'projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION]/keyRings/{}/cryptoKeys/{}'.format(key_ring_name, key_name)
    }
}

response = service.projects().locations().keyRings().cryptoKeys().create(parent='projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/{}'.format(location), body=request_body).execute()
```

7. Update the crypto key to use the new customer-managed encryption key:

```python
update_body = {
    'cryptoKey': {
        'name': crypto_key['name'],
        'purpose': crypto_key['purpose'],
        'versionTemplate': crypto_key['versionTemplate'],
        'nextRotationTime': crypto_key['nextRotationTime'],
        'rotationPeriod': crypto_key['rotationPeriod'],
        'labels': crypto_key['labels'],
        'customerManagedEncryption': {
            'kmsKeyName': 'projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION]/keyRings/{}/cryptoKeys/{}'.format(key_ring_name, key_name)
        }
    },
    'updateMask': 'customerManagedEncryption'
}

response = service.projects().locations().keyRings().cryptoKeys().patch(name=crypto_key['name'], body=update_body).execute()
```

Note: Replace [PROJECT_ID] and [LOCATION] with your project ID and location respectively.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Customer Master Keys (CMKs) Should Be Used" in GCP using Python.
