### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to KMS Keys: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner), scroll down and click on "Security" and then "Key Management". This will take you to the KMS Keys page where you can see all the keys that have been created in your project.

3. Check for Unique Keys: On the KMS Keys page, you can see a list of all the keys that have been created in your project. Each key should have a unique name. If you see any keys with the same name, this could indicate a misconfiguration. 

4. Verify Key Usage: Check the "Key Usage" column for each key. Each key should be associated with a unique application or service. If you see a key that is being used by multiple applications or services, this could also indicate a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install and authenticate it with your GCP account.

2. Once the SDK is installed and configured, open your terminal and use the following command to list all the keys in a specific location:

   ```
   gcloud kms keys list --location [LOCATION] --keyring [KEYRING]
   ```
   Replace [LOCATION] and [KEYRING] with the location and keyring of your keys.

3. To check the details of a specific key, use the following command:

   ```
   gcloud kms keys describe [KEY_NAME] --location [LOCATION] --keyring [KEYRING]
   ```
   Replace [KEY_NAME], [LOCATION], and [KEYRING] with the name, location, and keyring of your key.

4. Repeat step 3 for each key in your app-tier. If you find any keys with the same name or other identical properties, it means that they are not unique.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you start, make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You will need the `boto3` library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up AWS credentials: You need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key'
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_key'
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use the AWS CLI to configure your credentials:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. Write a Python script to list all KMS keys: Now you can write a Python script that uses the `boto3` library to list all KMS keys in your account. Here is a simple script that does this:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_kms_keys():
       client = boto3.client('kms')
       response = client.list_keys()
       return response['Keys']

   keys = list_kms_keys()
   for key in keys:
       print(key['KeyId'])
   ```

4. Check for unique keys in the app-tier: To check if each KMS key is unique in the app-tier, you would need to have a way to identify which keys are used in the app-tier. This could be done by following a naming convention or tagging keys. Once you have this, you can modify the script to check for uniqueness. Here is an example where keys are tagged with 'AppTier':

   ```python
   import boto3

   def list_app_tier_keys():
       client = boto3.client('kms')
       response = client.list_keys()
       app_tier_keys = [key for key in response['Keys'] if 'AppTier' in key['Tags']]
       return app_tier_keys

   keys = list_app_tier_keys()
   if len(keys) != len(set(keys)):
       print("Duplicate keys found in AppTier")
   else:
       print("All keys in AppTier are unique")
   ```

   This script first filters out the keys that are tagged with 'AppTier'. It then checks if the number of keys is the same as the number of unique keys. If not, it prints a message indicating that duplicate keys were found.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "KMS Key Should Have Unique Key In An App-Tier" for GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to your GCP console.
2. Go to the Cloud KMS page.
3. Click on the Key Rings in the left-hand menu.
4. Select the key ring in which the misconfigured key is present.
5. Select the key that has the misconfiguration.
6. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
7. In the "Key rotation" section, enable the "Automatic key rotation" option.
8. In the "Labels" section, add a label with a unique key that identifies the key as being used in the app-tier.
9. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

By following the above steps, you have now remediated the misconfiguration "KMS Key Should Have Unique Key In An App-Tier" for GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.

2. Set the project where the KMS key exists as the default project using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```

3. Get the list of all the KMS keys in the project using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud kms keys list
   ```

4. Identify the KMS key that is used in the app-tier and note down its name.

5. Get the details of the KMS key using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud kms keys describe [KEY_NAME]
   ```

6. Check if the key is unique by verifying that it is not used in any other app-tier in the project.

7. If the key is not unique, create a new KMS key using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud kms keys create [NEW_KEY_NAME] --location [LOCATION] --keyring [KEYRING_NAME] --purpose encryption
   ```

   Replace [NEW_KEY_NAME] with a unique name for the new KMS key, [LOCATION] with the location where you want to create the key, and [KEYRING_NAME] with the name of the keyring where you want to create the key.

8. Update the app-tier to use the new KMS key.

9. Delete the old KMS key using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud kms keys delete [KEY_NAME]
   ```

   Replace [KEY_NAME] with the name of the old KMS key that you want to delete.

10. Verify that the misconfiguration has been remediated by checking that the KMS key used in the app-tier is unique and not used in any other app-tier in the project.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "KMS Key Should Have Unique Key In An App-Tier" for GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the KMS key that is being used by the App-Tier in GCP.

2. Check if the KMS key is unique and not being used by any other application or service in GCP.

3. If the KMS key is not unique, create a new KMS key for the App-Tier.

4. Update the App-Tier to use the new KMS key.

Here's the Python code to remediate the misconfiguration:

```python
from google.cloud import kms_v1

# Set the name of the KMS key being used by the App-Tier
key_name = 'projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/<LOCATION>/keyRings/<KEYRING_NAME>/cryptoKeys/<KEY_NAME>'

# Create a KMS client
client = kms_v1.KeyManagementServiceClient()

# Check if the KMS key is unique
response = client.list_key_rings(parent='projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/<LOCATION>')
for key_ring in response:
    for crypto_key in key_ring.crypto_keys:
        if crypto_key.name == key_name:
            print('KMS key is not unique.')
            # Create a new KMS key for the App-Tier
            new_key_name = 'projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/<LOCATION>/keyRings/<KEYRING_NAME>/cryptoKeys/new_key'
            new_key = client.create_crypto_key(parent='projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/<LOCATION>/keyRings/<KEYRING_NAME>', crypto_key_id='new_key', purpose=kms_v1.CryptoKey.CryptoKeyPurpose.ENCRYPT_DECRYPT)
            # Update the App-Tier to use the new KMS key
            # ...
            break
    else:
        continue
    break
else:
    print('KMS key is unique.')
```

Note: Replace `<PROJECT_ID>`, `<LOCATION>`, `<KEYRING_NAME>`, `<KEY_NAME>` with the appropriate values for your GCP project and KMS key.
