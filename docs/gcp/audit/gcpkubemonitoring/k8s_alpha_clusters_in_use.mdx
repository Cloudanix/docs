How to disable if Alpha Clusters are used for production?

#### Using GCP Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console using your GCP account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section by selecting "Kubernetes Engine" from the main menu.
3. Select the GKE cluster for which you want to remediate the `enableKubernetesAlpha` setting.
4. In the cluster details page, click on the "Edit" button.
5. Scroll down to the "Additional Features" section and locate the "enableKubernetesAlpha" setting.
6. If the setting is enabled (set to true), it means that alpha features are allowed in the cluster.
7. Click on the toggle switch or checkbox to disable the `enableKubernetesAlpha` setting, setting it to false.
   - Disabling this setting ensures that alpha features are not allowed in the cluster, improving stability and preventing potential issues associated with alpha features.
8. Review the cluster details to ensure that the `enableKubernetesAlpha` setting is now disabled.
9. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes to the GKE cluster.
10. Repeat these steps for any other GKE clusters where `enableKubernetesAlpha` is enabled.
