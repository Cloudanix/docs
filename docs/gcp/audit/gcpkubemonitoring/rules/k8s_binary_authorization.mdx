### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Login to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google account. 

2. Navigate to Kubernetes Engine: From the left-hand side menu in the GCP Console, click on "Kubernetes Engine" to view the list of your Kubernetes clusters.

3. Select the Cluster: From the list of available clusters, click on the name of the cluster you want to inspect for Binary Authorization.

4. Check Binary Authorization: In the cluster details page, scroll down to the "Security" section. Here, you should see an option for "Binary Authorization". If it's enabled, it means Binary Authorization is in use. If it's disabled or not present, it means Binary Authorization is not in use for the selected Kubernetes cluster.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI if you haven't done so already. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions provided.

2. Once the SDK is installed, authenticate your account by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to log in with your Google account.

3. Set your project ID to the project you want to check. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual project ID in the following command:
   ```
   gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

4. Run the following command to check the Binary Authorization policy for your project:
   ```
   gcloud beta container binauthz policy describe
   ```
   This command will return the Binary Authorization policy for your project. If Binary Authorization is not enabled, the `defaultAdmissionRule` field will not be set to `REQUIRE_ATTESTATION`, which indicates a misconfiguration.

#### Using Python

Binary Authorization is a deploy-time security control that ensures only trusted container images are deployed on Kubernetes Engine. Here are the steps to detect if Binary Authorization is enabled in Kubernetes using Python scripts:

1. **Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud:**
   Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud. You can install the Google Cloud SDK by following the instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install. For the Python Client, you can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install google-cloud
   ```

2. **Authenticate and Set Project:**
   Use the `gcloud` command-line tool to authenticate and set your project. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual project ID.
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

3. **Python Script to Check Binary Authorization:**
   Use the Python Client for Google Cloud to interact with the Kubernetes Engine API. The following script checks if Binary Authorization is enabled for all clusters in a project:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import container_v1

   def check_binary_authorization():
       client = container_v1.ClusterManagerClient()
       project_id = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
       zone = '-'  # Use '-' for all zones

       response = client.list_clusters(project_id, zone)

       for cluster in response.clusters:
           if cluster.binary_authorization.enabled:
               print(f'Binary Authorization is enabled for cluster {cluster.name}')
           else:
               print(f'Binary Authorization is NOT enabled for cluster {cluster.name}')

   check_binary_authorization()
   ```
   Replace `'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'` with your actual project ID. This script will print out whether Binary Authorization is enabled for each cluster in the project.

4. **Run the Python Script:**
   Save the script to a file, for example `check_binary_auth.py`, and run it with Python:
   ```
   python check_binary_auth.py
   ```
   This will print out the Binary Authorization status for each cluster in your project. If Binary Authorization is not enabled for a cluster, it indicates a misconfiguration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Ensure Use Of Binary Authorization" misconfiguration in GCP using the GCP console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the "Binary Authorization" page.

2. Click the "Create Policy" button to create a new policy.

3. In the "Create Policy" dialog box, enter a name for the policy and select the "Enforce for all images" option.

4. In the "Policy" section, click the "Add Rule" button to add a new rule.

5. In the "Add Rule" dialog box, select the "Require Attestation" option and choose the attestation provider you want to use.

6. Click the "Save" button to save the rule.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 to add additional rules as needed.

8. Click the "Create" button to create the policy.

9. Once the policy is created, you can assign it to a cluster or node pool by navigating to the "Cluster" or "Node Pools" page and clicking the "Edit" button for the cluster or node pool you want to assign the policy to.

10. In the "Security" section, select the policy you just created from the "Binary Authorization Policy" dropdown menu.

11. Click the "Save" button to save the changes.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the "Ensure Use Of Binary Authorization" misconfiguration in GCP using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Ensure Use of Binary Authorization" misconfiguration on GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.

2. Run the following command to enable the Binary Authorization API:

```
gcloud services enable binaryauthorization.googleapis.com
```

3. Create a policy that requires all container images to be signed. You can do this by creating a policy file in YAML format with the following content:

```
globalPolicyEvaluationMode: REQUIRE_ATTESTATION
defaultAdmissionRule:
  enforcementMode: ALWAYS_DENY
  evaluationMode: REQUIRE_ATTESTATION
```

4. Save the policy file to your local machine.

5. Upload the policy file to the Binary Authorization policy library using the following command:

```
gcloud beta container binauthz policy import <PATH_TO_POLICY_FILE> --project <PROJECT_ID>
```

Replace `<PATH_TO_POLICY_FILE>` with the path to the policy file on your local machine, and `<PROJECT_ID>` with the ID of your GCP project.

6. Configure your Kubernetes cluster to use Binary Authorization by adding the following annotation to the pod spec in your deployment YAML file:

```
annotations:
  container.binauthz.io/enabled: "true"
```

7. Apply the updated deployment YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster using the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f <PATH_TO_DEPLOYMENT_YAML_FILE>
```

Replace `<PATH_TO_DEPLOYMENT_YAML_FILE>` with the path to the updated deployment YAML file on your local machine.

8. Verify that Binary Authorization is enabled by running the following command:

```
gcloud beta container binauthz policy export --project <PROJECT_ID>
```

This command should return the policy file that you uploaded in step 5.

By following these steps, you have remediated the "Ensure Use of Binary Authorization" misconfiguration on GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Ensure Use of Binary Authorization" misconfiguration in GCP, you can use the following Python code:

1. First, you need to enable the Binary Authorization API in your GCP project. You can do this by running the following command:

```python
from google.cloud import services
services.enable('binaryauthorization.googleapis.com')
```

2. Next, you need to create a policy that enforces the use of binary authorization for all container images. You can do this by running the following code:

```python
from google.cloud import binaryauthorization_v1beta1 as binaryauthorization

# Create a policy that requires binary authorization for all container images
policy_client = binaryauthorization.PolicyServiceClient()
policy = policy_client.create_policy(
    parent='projects/PROJECT_ID',
    policy={
        'name': 'projects/PROJECT_ID/policy',
        'globalPolicyEvaluationMode': binaryauthorization.enums.GlobalPolicyEvaluationMode.GLOBAL_POLICY_EVALUATION_MODE_ENABLED,
        'admissionWhitelistPatterns': [
            {
                'namePattern': '*',
                'versionPattern': '*'
            }
        ],
        'defaultAdmissionRule': {
            'evaluationMode': binaryauthorization.enums.AdmissionRule.EvaluationMode.REQUIRE_ATTESTATION,
            'requireAttestationsBy': [
                {
                    'humanReadableName': 'Google-signed Attestation',
                    'contentType': binaryauthorization.enums.AttestationAuthority.AttestationContentType.ATTESTATION_CONTENT_TYPE_GOOGLE_BINARY_AUTHORITY_V1_BLOB,
                    'pgpKeyId': ''
                }
            ]
        }
    }
)
```

Note that you will need to replace `PROJECT_ID` with your actual GCP project ID.

3. Finally, you need to configure your Kubernetes Engine cluster to use binary authorization. You can do this by adding the following annotation to your Kubernetes deployment YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
  annotations:
    container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/my-container: runtime/default
    beta.cloud.google.com/binary-authorization: '{"name":"projects/PROJECT_ID/policy"}'
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: gcr.io/my-project/my-image:latest
```

Again, you will need to replace `PROJECT_ID` with your actual GCP project ID.

Once you have completed these steps, your GCP project will be configured to enforce the use of binary authorization for all container images.
