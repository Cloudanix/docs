Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "Integrity Monitoring Should Be Enabled For Kubernetes Node Pools" for GCP using GCP console:

1. Go to the GCP Console and select the project where the Kubernetes node pool is located.
2. In the left navigation menu, select "Kubernetes Engine" and then select "Node pools".
3. From the list of node pools, select the node pool that you want to enable Integrity Monitoring for.
4. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
5. Scroll down to the "Security" section and click on "Show".
6. Find the option for "Integrity monitoring" and toggle it to "On".
7. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page to save your changes.

After completing these steps, Integrity Monitoring will be enabled for the selected Kubernetes node pool on GCP.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Integrity Monitoring should be enabled for Kubernetes Node Pools" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP Cloud Shell or open the terminal and connect to the GCP project using the command `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]`.

2. Run the following command to enable the integrity monitoring for Kubernetes node pools:

```
gcloud container node-pools update [NODE_POOL_NAME] --cluster=[CLUSTER_NAME] --enable-intra-node-visibility --enable-integrity-monitoring
```

Replace `[NODE_POOL_NAME]` with the name of the node pool and `[CLUSTER_NAME]` with the name of the cluster.

3. Verify the integrity monitoring is enabled for the node pool by running the following command:

```
gcloud container node-pools describe [NODE_POOL_NAME] --cluster=[CLUSTER_NAME] | grep integrity
```

If the output shows `"integrityMonitoringEnabled: true"`, then the integrity monitoring is enabled for the node pool.

4. Repeat the above steps for all the node pools in the cluster.

By following the above steps, integrity monitoring will be enabled for Kubernetes node pools in GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Integrity Monitoring Should Be Enabled For Kubernetes Node Pools" for GCP using python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to authenticate with the GCP project using the following python code:

```python
from google.auth import compute_engine
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3

# Authenticate with GCP project
credentials = compute_engine.Credentials()
client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient(credentials=credentials)
project_id = 'your-project-id'
```

2. Then, you need to get the list of Kubernetes node pools in the GCP project using the following python code:

```python
# Get the list of Kubernetes node pools
node_pools = []
for cluster in client.list_clusters(project_id):
    for pool in client.list_node_pools(project_id, cluster.name):
        node_pools.append(pool)
```

3. Next, you need to check if integrity monitoring is enabled for each Kubernetes node pool using the following python code:

```python
# Check if integrity monitoring is enabled for each node pool
for pool in node_pools:
    if not pool.management.auto_repair.integrity_monitoring:
        # Enable integrity monitoring
        pool.management.auto_repair.integrity_monitoring = True
        client.update_node_pool(project_id, pool.cluster_id, pool.name, pool)
```

4. Finally, you can print a message indicating that the remediation is complete using the following python code:

```python
# Print a message indicating that the remediation is complete
print('Integrity monitoring has been enabled for all Kubernetes node pools.')
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Integrity Monitoring Should Be Enabled For Kubernetes Node Pools" for GCP using python.
