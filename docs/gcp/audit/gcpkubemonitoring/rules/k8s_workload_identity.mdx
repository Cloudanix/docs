   - If you already have a workload identity pool, select it from the dropdown menu.
   - If you need to create a new workload identity pool, click on the "Create new workload identity pool" button and follow the prompts to create one.
8. Review the cluster details to ensure that the workload identity pool is now configured.
9. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes to the GKE cluster.
10. Repeat these steps for any other GKE clusters where the workload identity pool is disabled.
