### More Info:

Ensures all Kubernetes clusters have the web dashboard disabled. It is recommended to disable the web dashboard because it is backed by a highly privileged service account.

### Risk Level

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console.

2. Navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section. Here, you will find a list of all your Kubernetes clusters.

3. Click on the specific cluster you want to inspect. This will open the cluster's details page.

4. Check the "Kubernetes Dashboard" section. If it is enabled, then the web dashboard is not disabled. If it is not present or disabled, then the web dashboard is disabled.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, you can authenticate your Google Cloud account by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. After successful authentication, you need to set your project ID to the project you want to check. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual project ID.

3. Now, you can get the list of all running clusters in your project by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud container clusters list
   ```

4. For each cluster, you can check if the Kubernetes Dashboard is enabled or not by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE] | grep -i dashboard
   ```

   Replace `[CLUSTER_NAME]` with the name of your cluster and `[ZONE]` with the zone of your cluster. If the output of this command contains "kubernetes-dashboard", then the Kubernetes Dashboard is enabled on your cluster.

#### Using Python

1. Import the necessary libraries: You will need the Kubernetes Python client to interact with the Kubernetes API. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install kubernetes
```

Then, import the necessary modules in your Python script:

```python
from kubernetes import client, config
```

2. Load the Kubernetes configuration: If you're running the script from within a Pod in the cluster, you can use `load_incluster_config()`. If you're running the script from your local machine, you can use `load_kube_config()`:

```python
config.load_kube_config()
```

3. Get the list of services in the 'kube-system' namespace: The Kubernetes Dashboard is usually deployed in the 'kube-system' namespace. You can get the list of services in this namespace using the `list_namespaced_service()` function:

```python
v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
services = v1.list_namespaced_service(namespace='kube-system')
```

4. Check if the Kubernetes Dashboard is enabled: You can iterate over the list of services and check if the Kubernetes Dashboard is enabled. If the 'kubernetes-dashboard' service is found, it means that the Dashboard is enabled:

```python
dashboard_enabled = False
for service in services.items:
    if service.metadata.name == 'kubernetes-dashboard':
        dashboard_enabled = True
        break

if dashboard_enabled:
    print("Kubernetes Dashboard is enabled.")
else:
    print("Kubernetes Dashboard is disabled.")
```

This script will print a message indicating whether the Kubernetes Dashboard is enabled or not.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Web Dashboard Should Be Disabled" misconfiguration in GCP using the GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the GCP Console.

2. Navigate to the GCP project that has the misconfiguration.

3. In the left-hand menu, select "IAM & Admin" and then click on "Dashboard."

4. In the "Dashboard" page, you will see the "Web Dashboard" option. Click on the three dots on the right-hand side of the "Web Dashboard" option and select "Disable."

5. A confirmation message will appear. Click on "Disable" to confirm.

6. Once the "Web Dashboard" has been disabled, you will no longer be able to access it from the GCP Console.

7. Verify that the "Web Dashboard" has been disabled by going back to the "Dashboard" page and confirming that the "Web Dashboard" option is no longer available.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the "Web Dashboard Should Be Disabled" misconfiguration in GCP using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Web Dashboard Should Be Disabled" misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.
2. Run the following command to disable the web dashboard:

```
gcloud container clusters update [CLUSTER_NAME] --update-addons=KubernetesDashboard=DISABLED
```

Replace `[CLUSTER_NAME]` with the name of your GCP cluster.

3. Verify that the web dashboard is disabled by running the following command:

```
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

You should not see any pods with the name `kubernetes-dashboard` in the output.

4. (Optional) If you want to completely remove the web dashboard, run the following command:

```
kubectl delete deployment kubernetes-dashboard -n kube-system
```

This will delete the `kubernetes-dashboard` deployment from the `kube-system` namespace.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Web Dashboard Should Be Disabled" misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Web Dashboard Should Be Disabled" in GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient import discovery
```

2. Set up the credentials and the API client:

```python
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path_to_service_account_file>')
service = discovery.build('cloudresourcemanager', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

3. Get the project ID:

```python
project_id = '<your_project_id>'
```

4. Get the project IAM policy:

```python
policy = service.projects().getIamPolicy(resource=project_id).execute()
```

5. Check if the "roles/viewer" role is granted to "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers":

```python
for binding in policy['bindings']:
    if binding['role'] == 'roles/viewer':
        if 'allUsers' in binding['members'] or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' in binding['members']:
            print('Web Dashboard is enabled for all users')
```

6. Remove the "roles/viewer" role from "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers":

```python
for binding in policy['bindings']:
    if binding['role'] == 'roles/viewer':
        if 'allUsers' in binding['members'] or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' in binding['members']:
            binding['members'].remove('allUsers')
            binding['members'].remove('allAuthenticatedUsers')
            policy = service.projects().setIamPolicy(resource=project_id, body={'policy': policy}).execute()
            print('Web Dashboard has been disabled for all users')
```

Note: Make sure to replace `<path_to_service_account_file>` and `<your_project_id>` with the actual values. Also, ensure that the service account used has the necessary permissions to modify IAM policies.
