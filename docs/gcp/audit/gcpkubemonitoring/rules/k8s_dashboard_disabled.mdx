### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "Web Dashboard Should Be Disabled" misconfiguration in GCP using the GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the GCP Console.

2. Navigate to the GCP project that has the misconfiguration.

3. In the left-hand menu, select "IAM & Admin" and then click on "Dashboard."

4. In the "Dashboard" page, you will see the "Web Dashboard" option. Click on the three dots on the right-hand side of the "Web Dashboard" option and select "Disable."

5. A confirmation message will appear. Click on "Disable" to confirm.

6. Once the "Web Dashboard" has been disabled, you will no longer be able to access it from the GCP Console.

7. Verify that the "Web Dashboard" has been disabled by going back to the "Dashboard" page and confirming that the "Web Dashboard" option is no longer available.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the "Web Dashboard Should Be Disabled" misconfiguration in GCP using the GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Web Dashboard Should Be Disabled" misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.
2. Run the following command to disable the web dashboard:

```
gcloud container clusters update [CLUSTER_NAME] --update-addons=KubernetesDashboard=DISABLED
```

Replace `[CLUSTER_NAME]` with the name of your GCP cluster.

3. Verify that the web dashboard is disabled by running the following command:

```
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

You should not see any pods with the name `kubernetes-dashboard` in the output.

4. (Optional) If you want to completely remove the web dashboard, run the following command:

```
kubectl delete deployment kubernetes-dashboard -n kube-system
```

This will delete the `kubernetes-dashboard` deployment from the `kube-system` namespace.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Web Dashboard Should Be Disabled" misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Web Dashboard Should Be Disabled" in GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient import discovery
```

2. Set up the credentials and the API client:

```python
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path_to_service_account_file>')
service = discovery.build('cloudresourcemanager', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

3. Get the project ID:

```python
project_id = '<your_project_id>'
```

4. Get the project IAM policy:

```python
policy = service.projects().getIamPolicy(resource=project_id).execute()
```

5. Check if the "roles/viewer" role is granted to "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers":

```python
for binding in policy['bindings']:
    if binding['role'] == 'roles/viewer':
        if 'allUsers' in binding['members'] or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' in binding['members']:
            print('Web Dashboard is enabled for all users')
```

6. Remove the "roles/viewer" role from "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers":

```python
for binding in policy['bindings']:
    if binding['role'] == 'roles/viewer':
        if 'allUsers' in binding['members'] or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' in binding['members']:
            binding['members'].remove('allUsers')
            binding['members'].remove('allAuthenticatedUsers')
            policy = service.projects().setIamPolicy(resource=project_id, body={'policy': policy}).execute()
            print('Web Dashboard has been disabled for all users')
```

Note: Make sure to replace `<path_to_service_account_file>` and `<your_project_id>` with the actual values. Also, ensure that the service account used has the necessary permissions to modify IAM policies.
