### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform web console and sign in with your Google account that has the necessary permissions to access the Kubernetes clusters.

2. Navigate to Kubernetes Engine: From the main dashboard of the Google Cloud Platform Console, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner). Scroll down and click on "Kubernetes Engine" under the "Compute" section.

3. Select the Kubernetes Cluster: You will see a list of all your Kubernetes clusters. Click on the name of the cluster you want to check for shielded nodes.

4. Check for Shielded Nodes: In the cluster details page, scroll down to the "Node Pools" section. Click on the name of the node pool to expand its details. Look for the "Security" section. If the "Enable Shielded Nodes" option is checked, then shielded nodes are being used for the Kubernetes cluster. If it's not checked, then shielded nodes are not being used.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install and authenticate it.

2. Once the SDK is installed and configured, open your terminal and run the following command to list all the Kubernetes clusters in your GCP project:

   ```
   gcloud container clusters list --project=[PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual Google Cloud project ID.

3. To check if Shielded Nodes are enabled for a specific Kubernetes cluster, run the following command:

   ```
   gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone=[ZONE] --format=json | grep shieldedNodes
   ```

   Replace `[CLUSTER_NAME]` with the name of your Kubernetes cluster and `[ZONE]` with the zone where your cluster is located. This command will return a JSON object with the configuration of your cluster. If Shielded Nodes are enabled, the `enabled` field under `shieldedNodes` will be set to `true`.

4. If you want to check this for all clusters, you can use a loop in bash:

   ```
   for cluster in $(gcloud container clusters list --format='value(name)'); do
   echo "Cluster: $cluster"
   gcloud container clusters describe $cluster --format=json | grep shieldedNodes
   done
   ```

   This will list all your clusters and their Shielded Nodes status.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries:
   You will need the Google Cloud SDK and the Python client for Google Kubernetes Engine. You can install these with pip:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-sdk google-cloud-container
   ```

2. Authenticate with Google Cloud:
   Before you can interact with Google Cloud resources, you need to authenticate. You can do this with the `gcloud` command-line tool:

   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. Write a Python script to check for shielded nodes:
   Here is a basic script that lists all clusters in a project and checks if they have shielded nodes enabled:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import container_v1

   def check_shielded_nodes(project_id):
       client = container_v1.ClusterManagerClient()

       # Get all clusters in the project
       clusters = client.list_clusters(project_id).clusters

       for cluster in clusters:
           # Check if shielded nodes are enabled
           if not cluster.shielded_nodes.enabled:
               print(f"Cluster {cluster.name} does not have shielded nodes enabled.")

   # Replace 'my-project' with your project ID
   check_shielded_nodes('my-project')
   ```

4. Run the script:
   You can run the script from the command line with Python:

   ```bash
   python check_shielded_nodes.py
   ```
   
   This will print out the names of any clusters in the specified project that do not have shielded nodes enabled. If no output is produced, that means all clusters in the project have shielded nodes enabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not using Shielded Nodes for a Kubernetes Cluster in GCP, you can follow the below steps using GCP console:

1. Go to the GCP Console and select the Kubernetes Engine from the navigation menu.
2. Select the Kubernetes Cluster for which you want to enable Shielded Nodes.
3. Click on the Edit button at the top of the page.
4. Scroll down to the Node Pools section and click on the node pool name for which you want to enable Shielded Nodes.
5. In the Node Pool edit page, scroll down to the Security section and enable the Shielded Nodes option.
6. Click on the Save button to save the changes.

After completing these steps, Shielded Nodes will be enabled for the selected node pool in your Kubernetes Cluster. You can repeat these steps for all the node pools in your cluster to ensure that all nodes are using Shielded Nodes.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of using shielded nodes for a Kubernetes cluster on GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to check if the Kubernetes cluster is using shielded nodes or not. To check this, run the following command:

```
gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER-NAME] --zone [ZONE] | grep -i shielded
```

2. If the output of the above command shows that shielded nodes are not enabled, then you can enable it by running the following command:

```
gcloud beta container clusters update [CLUSTER-NAME] --zone [ZONE] --update-shielded-nodes
```

3. If the output of the above command shows an error message saying that the beta component is not enabled, then you need to enable it by running the following command:

```
gcloud components install beta
```

4. Once the beta component is installed, you can run the previous command again to enable the shielded nodes.

5. After enabling the shielded nodes, you can verify it by running the first command again. The output should show that shielded nodes are enabled for the Kubernetes cluster.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not using shielded nodes for a Kubernetes cluster on GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of not using shielded nodes for a Kubernetes cluster in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Install the Google Cloud SDK and Python client library using the following commands:

```
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
exec -l $SHELL
gcloud init
pip install google-cloud
```

2. Create a new GCP project or select an existing project to work with.

3. Enable the necessary APIs for the project using the following command:

```
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
```

4. Authenticate the SDK using the following command:

```
gcloud auth login
```

5. Create a new Kubernetes cluster using the following command:

```
gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER_NAME] --shielded-secure-boot --shielded-integrity-monitoring
```

6. Verify that the shielded nodes are enabled for the cluster using the following command:

```
gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER_NAME] --format='get(shieldedNodes.enabled)'
```

This command should return "True" indicating that the shielded nodes are enabled for the cluster.

7. If you have an existing cluster, you can update the cluster to enable shielded nodes using the following command:

```
gcloud container clusters update [CLUSTER_NAME] --shielded-secure-boot --shielded-integrity-monitoring
```

This command will update the existing cluster to enable shielded nodes.

By following these steps, the misconfiguration of not using shielded nodes for a Kubernetes cluster in GCP can be remediated using Python.
