### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Kubernetes Engine: From the left-hand side menu, select "Kubernetes Engine" to view the list of your Kubernetes clusters.

3. Select the Cluster: Click on the name of the Kubernetes cluster you want to inspect. This will open the cluster's details page.

4. Check for VPC-Native Clusters: In the cluster's details page, look for the "Networking" section. Under this section, check the "Enable VPC-native (using alias IP)" option. If this option is enabled, it means that the cluster is a VPC-native cluster. If it's not enabled, then the cluster is not a VPC-native, indicating a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Authenticate your GCP account using the following command. This will open a new browser window and ask you to log in with your Google account. After successful login, your CLI will be authenticated with your GCP account.
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. Set your project ID to the project you want to check. Replace `your_project_id` with your actual project ID.
   ```
   gcloud config set project your_project_id
   ```

4. Run the following command to list all the Kubernetes clusters in your project and check if they are VPC-native or not. The `NETWORK_POLICY_CONFIG` column in the output indicates whether a cluster is VPC-native (`ENABLED`) or not (`DISABLED`).
   ```
   gcloud container clusters list --format='table(name, networkPolicy.enabled)'
   ```
   If the `NETWORK_POLICY_CONFIG` is `DISABLED` for a cluster, it means the cluster is not VPC-native.

#### Using Python

To check the use of VPC-Native Clusters in Kubernetes, you can use the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) or the Kubernetes Python client. Here are the steps:

1. **Install the necessary libraries:**
   You need to install the Google Cloud SDK and Kubernetes Python client. You can install them using pip:

   ```python
   pip install google-cloud-sdk
   pip install kubernetes
   ```

2. **Authenticate your SDK:**
   Before you can interact with your GCP resources, you need to authenticate your SDK. You can do this by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key JSON file.

   ```python
   import os
   os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
   ```

3. **List all the clusters in your project:**
   You can use the `list_clusters` method of the `Container` service in the Google Cloud SDK to list all the clusters in your project.

   ```python
   from google.cloud import container_v1

   client = container_v1.ClusterManagerClient()

   # Replace 'project_id' and 'zone' with your project id and zone
   response = client.list_clusters(project_id='project_id', zone='zone')

   for cluster in response.clusters:
       print(cluster.name)
   ```

4. **Check if the clusters are VPC-native:**
   You can check if a cluster is VPC-native by checking the `ip_allocation_policy` attribute of the cluster. If the `use_ip_aliases` attribute is `True`, then the cluster is VPC-native.

   ```python
   for cluster in response.clusters:
       if cluster.ip_allocation_policy.use_ip_aliases:
           print(f"{cluster.name} is a VPC-native cluster.")
       else:
           print(f"{cluster.name} is not a VPC-native cluster.")
   ```

This script will print the names of all the clusters in your project and whether they are VPC-native or not.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not using VPC-Native Clusters in GCP, you can follow the below steps using the GCP console:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Kubernetes Engine page.

2. Select your cluster that you want to make VPC-native.

3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.

4. Scroll down to the "Networking" section and click on "Enable VPC-native (using alias IP)".

5. Select the VPC network that you want to use for your cluster.

6. Select the subnet that you want to use for your cluster.

7. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page to apply the changes.

8. Verify that the VPC-native configuration is applied by checking the "Networking" section of your cluster details page.

By following these steps, you will be able to remediate the misconfiguration of not using VPC-Native Clusters in GCP and ensure that your cluster is using VPC-native networking.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Use Of VPC-Native Clusters" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP Cloud Shell.

2. Run the following command to enable VPC-native clusters for the default network:

```
gcloud container clusters update [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE] --enable-ip-alias
```

Replace `[CLUSTER_NAME]` with the name of the cluster that you want to update and `[ZONE]` with the zone in which the cluster is located.

3. Run the following command to verify that the VPC-native clusters are enabled:

```
gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE] | grep -i ipallocationpolicy
```

This command will display the IP allocation policy for the cluster. If the IP allocation policy is "Use IP aliases", then VPC-native clusters are enabled.

4. Repeat the above steps for all the GCP clusters in your environment.

By following the above steps, you can ensure the use of VPC-native clusters in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Use Of VPC-Native Clusters" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the necessary Python libraries:
```
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-cloud-container google-cloud-storage
```

2. Authenticate with GCP using a service account:
```
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/service_account.json')
```

3. Import the necessary libraries:
```
from google.cloud import container_v1
from google.cloud.container_v1.types import Cluster

client = container_v1.ClusterManagerClient(credentials=credentials)
```

4. Get the list of existing clusters in the project:
```
project_id = 'your-project-id'
zone = 'your-zone'

cluster_list = client.list_clusters(project_id, zone)
```

5. Check if each cluster is VPC-native or not:
```
for cluster in cluster_list.clusters:
    if not cluster.ip_allocation_policy.use_ip_aliases:
        # Update the cluster to use VPC-native
        cluster.ip_allocation_policy.use_ip_aliases = True
        update_request = Cluster(name=cluster.name, ip_allocation_policy=cluster.ip_allocation_policy)
        operation = client.update_cluster(project_id, zone, update_request)
        operation.result()
```

6. After running the script, all the clusters that are not VPC-native would be updated to use VPC-native.

Note: Make sure to replace 'your-project-id' and 'your-zone' with the actual project ID and zone where your GKE clusters are located. Also, make sure to have the necessary permissions to update the clusters.
