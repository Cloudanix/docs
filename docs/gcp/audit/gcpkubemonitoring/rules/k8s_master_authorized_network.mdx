### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your preferred web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform web console and sign in with your Google account that has the necessary permissions to access GCP resources.

2. Navigate to Kubernetes Engine: From the left-hand side menu, select "Kubernetes Engine". This will display a list of all the Kubernetes clusters that are currently running in your GCP environment.

3. Select the Kubernetes Cluster: From the list of Kubernetes clusters, select the cluster you want to check for the Master Authorized Network configuration. This will open the cluster's details page.

4. Check Master Authorized Networks: In the cluster's details page, look for the "Master Authorized Networks" section. If this section is not present or if it is present but disabled, then Master Authorized Network is not enabled for this Kubernetes cluster.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. This will provide you with the necessary command-line tools to interact with resources hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You can download it from the official GCP website and install it following the instructions provided.

2. Authenticate your GCP account using the following command. This will prompt you to log in with your GCP account credentials:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. Set your project ID to the project you want to check. Replace `your_project_id` with your actual project ID:

   ```
   gcloud config set project your_project_id
   ```

4. Run the following command to check if Master Authorized Network is enabled in Kubernetes:

   ```
   gcloud container clusters describe your_cluster_name --zone your_zone_name --format='value(masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig.enabled)'
   ```

   Replace `your_cluster_name` with the name of your Kubernetes cluster and `your_zone_name` with the zone where your cluster is located. If Master Authorized Network is enabled, this command will return `True`. If it's not enabled, it will return `False`.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: You will need the Google Cloud SDK and the Python client for Google Cloud. You can install these using pip:

   ```python
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-sdk google-cloud
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the client:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import container_v1

   client = container_v1.ClusterManagerClient()
   ```

3. Define the project and zone where your Kubernetes clusters are located:

   ```python
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   zone = 'your-zone'
   ```

4. Use the `list_clusters` method to retrieve all clusters in the specified project and zone. Then, iterate over the clusters and check the `master_authorized_networks_config` attribute. If `enabled` is False, then Master Authorized Network is not enabled:

   ```python
   response = client.list_clusters(project_id, zone)

   for cluster in response.clusters:
       if not cluster.master_authorized_networks_config.enabled:
           print(f"Master Authorized Network is not enabled for cluster {cluster.name}")
   ```
This script will print the names of all clusters where Master Authorized Network is not enabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Master Authorized Network Should Be Enabled" in GCP, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and log in to your account.
2. Select the project that you want to remediate the misconfiguration for.
3. In the left navigation menu, click on "IAM & Admin" and then click on "Service Accounts".
4. Find the service account that you want to enable Master Authorized Networks for and click on its name.
5. In the "Service account details" page, click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
6. Scroll down to the "Authorized networks" section and click on the "Add item" button.
7. In the "Add authorized network" dialog box, enter the IP address range that you want to allow access to this service account.
8. Click on the "Save" button to save your changes.

Once you have completed these steps, the Master Authorized Network will be enabled for the service account that you selected, and only the IP addresses that you specified will be able to access it.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Master Authorized Network Should Be Enabled" misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud SDK Shell or any terminal with the GCP CLI installed.
2. Run the following command to enable the Master Authorized Network feature:

   ```
   gcloud beta compute project-info add-metadata --metadata=enable-master-authorized-networks=TRUE
   ```

3. After running the command, you will receive a confirmation message indicating that the metadata was updated successfully.

   ```
   Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID].
   ```

   Note: Replace PROJECT_ID with your GCP project ID.

4. Verify that the Master Authorized Network feature is enabled by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud beta compute project-info describe --project PROJECT_ID | grep -i enable-master-authorized-networks
   ```

   If the feature is enabled, you will see the following output:

   ```
   enable-master-authorized-networks: 'TRUE'
   ```

5. After verifying that the feature is enabled, you can proceed with configuring the Master Authorized Networks by following the official GCP documentation: https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access#configuring_master_authorized_networks_for_private_google_access

   Note: This step is optional but highly recommended to ensure the security of your GCP resources.

By following these steps, you should have successfully remediated the "Master Authorized Network Should Be Enabled" misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Master Authorized Network Should Be Enabled" in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```python
from google.cloud import bigtable
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

2. Authenticate and create a client object:

```python
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/service_account.json')
client = bigtable.Client(project='project-id', credentials=credentials)
```

3. Get the instance object:

```python
instance_id = 'instance-id'
instance = client.instance(instance_id)
```

4. Get the current cluster object:

```python
cluster_id = 'cluster-id'
cluster = instance.cluster(cluster_id)
```

5. Check if the Master Authorized Networks is enabled or not:

```python
if not cluster.encryption_config:
    print('Master Authorized Networks is not enabled')
else:
    print('Master Authorized Networks is enabled')
```

6. If it is not enabled, enable it by updating the cluster object:

```python
if not cluster.encryption_config:
    cluster.encryption_config = bigtable.EncryptionInfo(
        encryption_type=bigtable.EncryptionInfo.EncryptionType.GOOGLE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION
    )
    cluster.update()
    print('Master Authorized Networks is enabled now')
else:
    print('Master Authorized Networks is already enabled')
```

7. Run the Python script to remediate the misconfiguration.

Note: Make sure to replace the 'path/to/service_account.json', 'project-id', 'instance-id' and 'cluster-id' with the actual values. Also, ensure that the service account has the necessary permissions to update the cluster object.
