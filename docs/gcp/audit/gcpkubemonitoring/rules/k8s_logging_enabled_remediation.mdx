### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your preferred web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Kubernetes Engine: From the left-hand side menu, select "Kubernetes Engine". This will display a list of all the Kubernetes clusters that are currently running in your GCP environment.

3. Select the Kubernetes Cluster: Click on the name of the Kubernetes cluster for which you want to check the logging configuration. This will open the cluster's details page.

4. Check Logging Configuration: On the cluster's details page, look for the "Stackdriver Logging" section. If logging is enabled, it will say "Enabled". If it is not enabled, it will say "Disabled".

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions for installation.

2. Once the SDK is installed, authenticate your account using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   This will open a new browser window for you to log in to your Google account. After successful login, your account will be authenticated.

3. Set your project ID to the project you want to check. Replace `your_project_id` with your actual project ID in the following command:
   ```
   gcloud config set project your_project_id
   ```

4. Now, you can check if logging is enabled in Kubernetes by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud logging read "resource.type=k8s_cluster AND logName:logs AND severity>=DEFAULT"
   ```
   This command will return all the logs from your Kubernetes clusters that have a severity level of DEFAULT or higher. If no logs are returned, it means that logging is not enabled in your Kubernetes clusters.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries:
   You will need the Kubernetes Python client to interact with the Kubernetes API. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install kubernetes
   ```

2. Connect to the Kubernetes API:
   You can use the `config.load_kube_config()` function from the Kubernetes client to load your kubeconfig file and connect to the API. Here is an example:
   ```python
   from kubernetes import client, config

   # Load the kubeconfig file
   config.load_kube_config()

   # Create an instance of the API class
   api_instance = client.CoreV1Api()
   ```

3. Check the logging configuration:
   You can use the `read_namespaced_pod_log()` function from the API instance to get the logs of a specific pod. If the function returns an error, it means that logging is not enabled for that pod. Here is an example:
   ```python
   try:
       # Replace 'pod_name' and 'namespace' with the name and namespace of the pod you want to check
       api_response = api_instance.read_namespaced_pod_log(name='pod_name', namespace='namespace')
       print("Logging is enabled for this pod.")
   except ApiException as e:
       print("Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod_log: %s\n" % e)
   ```

4. Iterate over all pods:
   To check the logging configuration for all pods, you can use the `list_pod_for_all_namespaces()` function and iterate over the result. Here is an example:
   ```python
   try:
       api_response = api_instance.list_pod_for_all_namespaces(watch=False)
       for i in api_response.items:
           pod_name = i.metadata.name
           namespace = i.metadata.namespace
           try:
               api_instance.read_namespaced_pod_log(name=pod_name, namespace=namespace)
               print(f"Logging is enabled for pod {pod_name} in namespace {namespace}.")
           except ApiException as e:
               print(f"Logging is not enabled for pod {pod_name} in namespace {namespace}.")
   except ApiException as e:
       print("Exception when calling CoreV1Api->list_pod_for_all_namespaces: %s\n" % e)
   ```
   This script will print whether logging is enabled for each pod in every namespace.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Logging Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP console, please follow the below steps:

1. Login to GCP console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Select the project for which you want to enable logging.
3. In the left navigation menu, select "Logging".
4. Click on "Log Exports" tab.
5. Click on "Create Export" button.
6. Select the logs which you want to export to Stackdriver Logging.
7. Choose the destination where you want to export logs to (e.g. BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage).
8. Configure the export settings as per your requirement.
9. Click on "Create" button.

Once the above steps are completed, logging will be enabled for your GCP project and you will be able to view logs in the Stackdriver Logging console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Logging Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to enable Stackdriver Logging for all resources in the current project:

   ```
   gcloud logging apply --configuration=cloudaudit.googleapis.com
   ```

3. If you want to enable Stackdriver Logging for a specific resource, run the following command:

   ```
   gcloud logging apply <resource-type>/<resource-name> --configuration=cloudaudit.googleapis.com
   ```

   Replace `<resource-type>` with the type of resource (e.g. `gce_instance`, `cloud_function`) and `<resource-name>` with the name of the resource.

4. Verify that Stackdriver Logging is enabled by going to the Logging page in the GCP Console. You should see logs for the resources that you enabled logging for.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all projects and resources in your GCP environment to ensure that logging is enabled for all resources.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the "Logging Should Be Enabled" misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Logging should be enabled" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to create a service account with the required permissions to enable logging. You can create a service account using the GCP console or using the following Python code:

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/service_account.json')
```

2. Next, you need to enable logging for the GCP project. You can use the `google-cloud-logging` library to enable logging using the following Python code:

```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2

client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client(credentials=credentials)
project_name = f"projects/{project_id}"
project = client.get_project(project_name)

if not project.logging_enabled:
    project.logging_enabled = True
    update_mask = {"paths": ["logging_enabled"]}
    client.update_project(project=project, update_mask=update_mask)
```

3. Replace `project_id` with the ID of the GCP project for which you want to enable logging.

4. Finally, run the Python script to enable logging for the GCP project. 

These steps will remediate the misconfiguration "Logging should be enabled" for GCP using Python.
