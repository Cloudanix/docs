### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Kubernetes Engine: From the left-hand side menu, select "Kubernetes Engine". This will display all the Kubernetes clusters that are currently running in your GCP account.

3. Select the Kubernetes Cluster: Click on the name of the Kubernetes cluster for which you want to check the Secure Boot configuration. This will open the cluster's details page.

4. Check Node Pools Configuration: In the cluster's details page, navigate to the "Node Pools" section. Here, you can see the configuration of each node pool. Look for the "Secure Boot" option. If it's enabled, it means Secure Boot is turned on for the Kubernetes Node Pools. If it's not present or disabled, it means Secure Boot is not enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions provided there.

2. Authenticate your GCP account using the following command. This will open a new window in your web browser asking you to log in to your Google Cloud account.
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. Set your project ID to the project you want to check. Replace `your_project_id` with your actual project ID.
   ```
   gcloud config set project your_project_id
   ```

4. Run the following command to list all the Kubernetes node pools in your project and check if Secure Boot is enabled. Replace `your_cluster_name` and `your_zone` with your actual cluster name and zone.
   ```
   gcloud container node-pools describe your_node_pool --cluster=your_cluster_name --zone=your_zone
   ```
   In the output, look for the `shieldedInstanceConfig` field. If `enableSecureBoot` is set to `true`, then Secure Boot is enabled. If it's set to `false` or not present, then Secure Boot is not enabled.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries:
   You will need the `google-cloud-container` library to interact with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-container
   ```

2. Authenticate with Google Cloud:
   Before you can interact with GKE, you need to authenticate with Google Cloud. You can do this using the `google.auth` library:
   ```python
   from google.auth import default

   credentials, project = default()
   ```

3. Connect to GKE:
   Now you can connect to GKE using the `google.cloud.container_v1.ClusterManagerClient` class:
   ```python
   from google.cloud.container_v1 import ClusterManagerClient

   client = ClusterManagerClient(credentials=credentials)
   ```

4. Check the secure boot setting for each node pool:
   You can use the `list_node_pools` method to get a list of all node pools in a cluster, and then check the `config.shielded_instance_config.enable_secure_boot` attribute for each one:
   ```python
   for cluster in client.list_clusters(project=project, zone='us-central1-a'):
       for node_pool in client.list_node_pools(project=project, zone='us-central1-a', cluster_id=cluster.name):
           if not node_pool.config.shielded_instance_config.enable_secure_boot:
               print(f"Node pool {node_pool.name} in cluster {cluster.name} does not have secure boot enabled.")
   ```
   This script will print a message for each node pool that does not have secure boot enabled. If no messages are printed, then secure boot is enabled for all node pools.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Secure Boot Should Be Enabled For Kubernetes Node Pools" for GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Kubernetes Engine page.
2. Click on the name of the cluster for which you want to enable Secure Boot.
3. Click on the "Nodes" tab and select the node pool for which you want to enable Secure Boot.
4. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
5. In the "Node pool details" section, scroll down to the "Security" section.
6. Check the box next to "Enable secure boot".
7. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page.

Once you have completed these steps, the Secure Boot will be enabled for the selected node pool of your Kubernetes cluster in GCP.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Secure Boot Should Be Enabled For Kubernetes Node Pools" for GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to get the list of node pools in your GKE cluster:

   ```
   gcloud container node-pools list --cluster [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE]
   ```

   Replace [CLUSTER_NAME] with the name of your GKE cluster and [ZONE] with the zone in which your cluster is located.

3. For each node pool, run the following command to enable secure boot:

   ```
   gcloud container node-pools update [NODE_POOL_NAME] --cluster [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE] --security-config enable-secure-boot
   ```

   Replace [NODE_POOL_NAME] with the name of the node pool.

4. Verify that secure boot is enabled for the node pool by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud container node-pools describe [NODE_POOL_NAME] --cluster [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE] | grep secureBoot
   ```

   If the output shows "secureBoot: true", then secure boot is enabled for the node pool.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all the node pools in your GKE cluster.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Secure Boot Should Be Enabled For Kubernetes Node Pools" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Secure Boot Should Be Enabled For Kubernetes Node Pools" for GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Google Cloud SDK and Python client library for GCP.

2. Create a new Python script and import the necessary libraries:

```python
import google.auth
from google.cloud import container_v1
```

3. Authenticate with GCP using the following code:

```python
credentials, project_id = google.auth.default()
client = container_v1.ClusterManagerClient(credentials=credentials)
```

4. Get the list of node pools in your GCP project using the following code:

```python
project_id = 'your-project-id'
zone = 'us-central1-a'
cluster_id = 'your-cluster-id'
response = client.list_node_pools(project_id, zone, cluster_id)
```

5. For each node pool, check if Secure Boot is enabled. If it is not enabled, update the node pool with Secure Boot enabled using the following code:

```python
for node_pool in response.node_pools:
    if not node_pool.config.secure_boot:
        node_pool.config.secure_boot = True
        update_request = container_v1.types.UpdateNodePoolRequest(
            project_id=project_id,
            zone=zone,
            cluster_id=cluster_id,
            node_pool_id=node_pool.name,
            node_pool=node_pool.config,
            update_mask={'paths': ['config.secure_boot']}
        )
        client.update_node_pool(update_request)
```

6. Save the Python script and run it to remediate the misconfiguration.

Note: Make sure to replace 'your-project-id', 'us-central1-a', and 'your-cluster-id' with your actual GCP project ID, zone, and cluster ID.
