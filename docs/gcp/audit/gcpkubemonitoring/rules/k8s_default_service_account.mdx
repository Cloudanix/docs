title: Default Service Accounts Should Not Be Used

### More Info:

Ensure Kubernetes cluster nodes do use the default service account. Kubernetes cluster nodes should use customized service accounts that have minimal privileges to run. This reduces the attack surface in the case of a malicious attack on the cluster.

How to disable GKE Cluster using Default Service Account?

#### Using GCP Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console using your GCP account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section by selecting "Kubernetes Engine" from the main menu.
   (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Default Service Accounts Should Not Be Used" Policy.)
3. Select the GKE cluster for which you want to remediate the default service account.
4. In the cluster details page, click on the "Edit" button.
5. Scroll down to the "Security" section and locate the "Service account" setting.
6. By default, the "Default" service account may be selected, which has excessive permissions. Change this setting to a custom service account that you have created specifically for the cluster.
   - If you have already created a custom service account, select it from the dropdown menu.
   - If you haven't created a custom service account, click on the "Create a new service account" button and follow the prompts to create one. Ensure that you grant the minimum necessary permissions to the custom service account.
7. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes to the GKE cluster.
8. Review the cluster details to ensure that the custom service account is now selected.
9. Repeat these steps for any other GKE clusters that are using the default service account.
