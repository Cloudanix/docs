---

### More Info:

### Risk Level

### Address

### Compliance Standards

### Remediation

#### Using GCP Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console using your GCP account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section by selecting "Kubernetes Engine" from the main menu.
   (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Control Plane Endpoint Access Should Be Limited To Authorized Networks" Policy.)
3. Select the GKE cluster for which you want to remediate the control plane access.
4. In the cluster details page, click on the "Edit" button.
5. Scroll down to the "Security" section and locate the "Control plane authorized networks" setting.
6. By default, this setting may be configured to allow access from all networks (`0.0.0.0/0`).
7. Click on the "Control plane authorized networks" field to modify the authorized networks.
8. Update the authorized networks to include only the specific IP ranges or networks that require access to the GKE control plane.
   - Remove the `0.0.0.0/0` entry if it exists.
   - Add the IP ranges or network CIDRs that need access to the control plane.
   - You can also specify individual IP addresses if necessary.
9. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes to the GKE cluster.
10. Review the cluster details to ensure that the control plane access is restricted to the authorized networks you specified.
11. Repeat these steps for any other GKE clusters where control plane access is given to all networks.
