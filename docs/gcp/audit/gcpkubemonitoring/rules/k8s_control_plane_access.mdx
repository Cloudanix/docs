### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console.

2. Navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section. Here, you will find a list of all your Kubernetes clusters.

3. Select the cluster you want to inspect. In the cluster details page, look for the "Control Plane Endpoint Access" section.

4. Check the "Master authorized networks" setting. If it is set to "default (0.0.0.0/0)", it means that the control plane endpoint access is not limited to authorized networks. This is a misconfiguration as it allows any IP address to access your Kubernetes API server.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website. After downloading, install it and authenticate it with your Google Cloud account using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. Get the list of clusters: Use the following command to get the list of all Kubernetes clusters in your GCP account.

   ```
   gcloud container clusters list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all clusters along with their details.

3. Get the details of each cluster: For each cluster, you need to check the details of the master authorized networks. Use the following command to get these details.

   ```
   gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER_NAME] --format=json
   ```

   Replace `[CLUSTER_NAME]` with the name of your cluster. This command will return a JSON object with the details of the cluster. Look for the `masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig` field in the JSON object.

4. Check the `masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig` field: If the `masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig` field is set to `enabled: false` or if it's not present, then the control plane endpoint access is not limited to authorized networks. If it's set to `enabled: true` and there are CIDR blocks specified in the `cidrBlocks` field, then the control plane endpoint access is limited to those networks.

#### Using Python

1. Import the necessary libraries in Python. You will need the Kubernetes client library to interact with the Kubernetes API.

```python
from kubernetes import client, config
```

2. Load the Kubernetes configuration. This can be done in two ways: either from a kubeconfig file or from within a pod running in the cluster. The following code loads the configuration from a kubeconfig file:

```python
config.load_kube_config()
```

3. Create an API instance. You will use this instance to interact with the Kubernetes API. In this case, you will use the CoreV1Api, which provides functions for interacting with the core v1 Kubernetes API.

```python
v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
```

4. Now, you can use the API instance to retrieve the list of services in the Kubernetes cluster. You can then iterate over this list and check the type of each service. If the type of the service is "LoadBalancer", then the control plane endpoint is exposed to the internet, which is a misconfiguration.

```python
services = v1.list_service_for_all_namespaces()
for service in services.items:
    if service.spec.type == 'LoadBalancer':
        print("Misconfiguration detected: Service {} in namespace {} is of type LoadBalancer".format(service.metadata.name, service.metadata.namespace))
```

This script will print a message for each service that is of type LoadBalancer, indicating that the control plane endpoint is exposed to the internet.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the control plane endpoint access misconfiguration in GCP, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the VPC network page.
2. Select the VPC network that you want to configure.
3. Click on the "Firewall rules" tab.
4. Click on the "Create Firewall Rule" button.
5. In the "Name" field, enter a name for the firewall rule.
6. In the "Targets" field, select "All instances in the network".
7. In the "Source IP ranges" field, enter the IP address range of the authorized networks that should have access to the control plane endpoint.
8. In the "Protocols and ports" section, select "Specified protocols and ports".
9. In the "Specified protocols and ports" field, enter "tcp:443".
10. Click on the "Create" button to create the firewall rule.

This will create a firewall rule that will restrict access to the control plane endpoint to only the authorized networks that you specified.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Control Plane Endpoint Access Should Be Limited To Authorized Networks" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to list the current authorized networks:

```
gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE] --format="value(masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig.cidrBlocks)"
```

Replace `[CLUSTER_NAME]` and `[ZONE]` with the name and zone of your cluster.

3. If the output shows that there are no authorized networks, or if the authorized networks are not correct, run the following command to add authorized networks:

```
gcloud container clusters update [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE] --update-master --master-authorized-networks=[CIDR_BLOCK]
```

Replace `[CLUSTER_NAME]`, `[ZONE]`, and `[CIDR_BLOCK]` with your own values. You can specify multiple CIDR blocks separated by commas.

4. Verify that the authorized networks have been added by running the first command again.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each cluster in your GCP project.

By following these steps, you will restrict access to the control plane endpoint to only the authorized networks, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

#### Using Python

To remediate "Control Plane Endpoint Access Should Be Limited To Authorized Networks" for GCP using python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import necessary libraries:

```python
from googleapiclient import discovery
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

2. Set up authentication using a service account:

```python
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    '/path/to/service_account_key.json')
```

3. Initialize the GCP API client:

```python
service = discovery.build('container', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

4. Get the current cluster configuration:

```python
project_id = 'your-project-id'
zone = 'your-zone'
cluster_id = 'your-cluster-id'

cluster = service.projects().zones().clusters().get(
    projectId=project_id, zone=zone, clusterId=cluster_id).execute()
```

5. Update the cluster configuration to limit control plane endpoint access to authorized networks:

```python
authorized_networks_config = {
    'enabled': True,
    'cidrBlocks': ['10.0.0.0/8', '172.16.0.0/12']
}

cluster['masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig'] = authorized_networks_config

response = service.projects().zones().clusters().update(
    projectId=project_id, zone=zone, clusterId=cluster_id, body=cluster).execute()
```

In this example, we are limiting control plane endpoint access to the IP ranges '10.0.0.0/8' and '172.16.0.0/12'. You can modify the `cidrBlocks` list to include the authorized networks for your specific use case.

Note: This code assumes that you have the necessary permissions to modify the cluster configuration.
