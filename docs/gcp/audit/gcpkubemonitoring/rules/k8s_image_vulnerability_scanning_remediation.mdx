### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Kubernetes Engine: From the left-hand side menu, select "Kubernetes Engine". This will display all the Kubernetes clusters that are currently running in your GCP environment.

3. Check for Image Vulnerability Scanning: Select a Kubernetes cluster and navigate to its details page. Look for the "Vulnerability Scanning" section. If this section is not present or if it's disabled, then Image Vulnerability Scanning is not being performed on the selected Kubernetes cluster.

4. Repeat for all clusters: Repeat the above step for all the Kubernetes clusters in your GCP environment. If any of them do not have Image Vulnerability Scanning enabled, then there is a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions for your specific operating system.

2. Once the SDK is installed, authenticate your account by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to log in with your Google Cloud account.

3. Set your project ID to the project you want to check. Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual project ID.
   ```
   gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```

4. Now, you can check if Image Vulnerability Scanning is enabled for your Kubernetes clusters. Run the following command to list all the clusters in your project:
   ```
   gcloud container clusters list
   ```
   This will return a list of all clusters along with their details. Look for the `enableVulnerabilityScanning` field. If it's set to `TRUE`, then Image Vulnerability Scanning is enabled. If it's `FALSE` or not present, then it's not enabled.

5. To check the vulnerability findings, use the following command:
   ```
   gcloud beta container images describe gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]/[IMAGE]:[TAG]
   ```
   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]`, `[IMAGE]`, and `[TAG]` with your actual project ID, image name, and tag. This command will return a description of the image, including any vulnerability findings.

#### Using Python

1. **Import Required Libraries**: The first step is to import the required libraries in your Python script. You will need the Kubernetes client library to interact with the Kubernetes API. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install kubernetes
```
Then, import it in your script:

```python
from kubernetes import client, config
```

2. **Configure Kubernetes Client**: The next step is to configure the Kubernetes client to connect to your Kubernetes cluster. If your script is running inside a pod in the cluster, you can use the in-cluster configuration. Otherwise, you can use your kubeconfig file:

```python
config.load_kube_config()
```

3. **List All Images**: Now, you can use the Kubernetes client to list all pods in all namespaces, and for each pod, list all containers and their images:

```python
v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
pods = v1.list_pod_for_all_namespaces(watch=False)
for pod in pods.items:
    for container in pod.spec.containers:
        print("Container Image: ", container.image)
```

4. **Check Image Vulnerability Scanning**: Finally, you need to check if image vulnerability scanning is performed for each image. This step depends on the specific vulnerability scanner you are using. For example, if you are using the Clair vulnerability scanner, you can use its API to check if an image has been scanned:

```python
import requests

def is_image_scanned(image):
    response = requests.get(f"http://clair-api-url/v1/layers/{image}")
    return response.status_code == 200

for pod in pods.items:
    for container in pod.spec.containers:
        if not is_image_scanned(container.image):
            print("Image not scanned: ", container.image)
```

This script will print all images that have not been scanned by Clair. Replace "clair-api-url" with the actual URL of your Clair API.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Image Vulnerability Scanning Is Performed" for GCP using GCP console, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Google Container Registry page.

2. Select the project that contains the image that you want to scan.

3. In the left-hand menu, select "Container Registry" under "Tools".

4. Click on the "Vulnerability scanning" tab.

5. If vulnerability scanning is not enabled, click on the "Enable scanning" button.

6. Choose the severity level for the vulnerabilities that you want to be notified about.

7. Click on the "Save" button to enable vulnerability scanning.

8. Once vulnerability scanning is enabled, you can view the scan results for all the images in your project.

9. If any vulnerabilities are detected, you can take appropriate actions to remediate them.

By following these steps, you can ensure that image vulnerability scanning is performed in GCP, and you can remediate any vulnerabilities that are detected.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of not having image vulnerability scanning enabled in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.

2. Run the following command to enable the Container Analysis API:

```
gcloud services enable containeranalysis.googleapis.com
```

3. Run the following command to create a new vulnerability scan for a specific image:

```
gcloud container images describe [IMAGE_NAME] --format='get(vulnerabilityReport)'
```

Note: Replace [IMAGE_NAME] with the name of the image you want to scan.

4. Run the following command to get a list of images that have vulnerability scanning enabled:

```
gcloud container images list --filter='vulnerabilityReport != null'
```

This will return a list of all the images that have vulnerability scanning enabled.

5. Run the following command to enable vulnerability scanning for all images in a specific project:

```
gcloud projects set-iam-policy [PROJECT_ID] \
--member=serviceAccount:service-[PROJECT_NUMBER]@container-analysis.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role=roles/containeranalysis.occurrenceViewer
```

Note: Replace [PROJECT_ID] with the ID of the project you want to enable vulnerability scanning for, and [PROJECT_NUMBER] with the number of the project.

6. Finally, run the following command to verify that vulnerability scanning is enabled for all images in the project:

```
gcloud container images list --project=[PROJECT_ID] --filter='vulnerabilityReport != null'
```

This will return a list of all the images in the project that have vulnerability scanning enabled.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not having image vulnerability scanning enabled in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Image Vulnerability Scanning Is Performed" in GCP, you can follow the below steps using Python:

1. Install the Google Cloud Client Library for Python using the below command:
```python
pip install google-cloud-storage
```

2. Create a new project in GCP and enable the Container Analysis API.

3. Create a service account and download the JSON key.

4. Set the environment variable for the service account key:

```python
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="[PATH]"
```

5. Use the below Python code to enable the Container Analysis API for all images in the project:

```python
from google.cloud import containeranalysis_v1
from google.cloud.containeranalysis_v1.proto import grafeas_pb2
from google.protobuf import json_format

client = containeranalysis_v1.ContainerAnalysisClient()

project_id = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'

parent = client.project_path(project_id)

for image in client.list_note_occurrences(parent):
    note_name = image.note_name
    occ_name = image.name
    occ = client.get_occurrence(occ_name)
    if not occ.vulnerability:
        continue
    vulnerability = occ.vulnerability
    if vulnerability.effective_severity == grafeas_pb2.Severity.SEVERITY_UNSPECIFIED:
        continue
    print(f'Image {note_name} has vulnerability {vulnerability.effective_severity.name}')
```

6. This code will list all the images with vulnerabilities in the specified project.

7. You can use the above code as a starting point to build your own tool to scan images for vulnerabilities and ensure that image vulnerability scanning is performed. 

8. You can also set up a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automatically scan images for vulnerabilities before deploying them to production.
