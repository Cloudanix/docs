### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of enabling Kubernetes Web UI on GCP, you can follow the below steps using the GCP console:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Kubernetes Engine page.
2. Select the cluster that you want to remediate.
3. Click on the "Actions" drop-down menu and select "Edit".
4. Scroll down to the "Add-ons" section and click on the "Disabled" radio button for the "Kubernetes Dashboard" option.
5. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page to save the changes.
6. Wait for a few minutes for the changes to take effect.

By following these steps, you will have successfully disabled the Kubernetes Web UI on your GCP cluster, thus remediating the misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of ensuring Kubernetes Web UI is disabled in GCP, you can follow the below steps using GCP CLI:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to get the status of the Kubernetes Web UI:
   
   ```
   kubectl get deployments -n kube-system
   ```
   
   This command will list all the deployments in the `kube-system` namespace.

3. Check if `kubernetes-dashboard` deployment is present in the output of the above command. If it is present, then the Kubernetes Web UI is enabled.

4. Run the following command to delete the `kubernetes-dashboard` deployment:
   
   ```
   kubectl delete deployment kubernetes-dashboard -n kube-system
   ```
   
   This command will delete the `kubernetes-dashboard` deployment from the `kube-system` namespace.

5. Verify that the `kubernetes-dashboard` deployment is deleted by running the following command:
   
   ```
   kubectl get deployments -n kube-system
   ```
   
   This command should not list the `kubernetes-dashboard` deployment.

6. Run the following command to delete the Kubernetes Web UI service:
   
   ```
   kubectl delete service kubernetes-dashboard -n kube-system
   ```
   
   This command will delete the Kubernetes Web UI service from the `kube-system` namespace.

7. Verify that the Kubernetes Web UI service is deleted by running the following command:
   
   ```
   kubectl get services -n kube-system
   ```
   
   This command should not list the `kubernetes-dashboard` service.

8. Finally, run the following command to verify that the Kubernetes Web UI is disabled:
   
   ```
   kubectl cluster-info
   ```
   
   This command should not list the Kubernetes Web UI endpoint.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of ensuring Kubernetes Web UI is disabled in GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Kubernetes Web UI Is Disabled" for GCP using python, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP console.

2. Install the required Python libraries: `google-auth` and `google-cloud-resource-manager`.

3. Set the project ID where the Kubernetes cluster is running: `PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>`

4. Set the name of the Kubernetes cluster: `CLUSTER_NAME=<your-cluster-name>`

5. Run the following Python code to disable Kubernetes Web UI:

```python
from google.cloud import resource_manager
from google.oauth2 import service_account

# Set the path to your service account key file
KEY_PATH = '/path/to/your/key.json'

# Authenticate with your GCP account
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(KEY_PATH)
client = resource_manager.Client(credentials=credentials)

# Find the Kubernetes cluster
for cluster in client.list_clusters(project=PROJECT_ID):
    if cluster.name == CLUSTER_NAME:
        # Disable Kubernetes Web UI
        cluster.master_auth.disabled = True
        client.update_cluster(cluster)
        print(f"Kubernetes Web UI is now disabled for cluster {CLUSTER_NAME}")
        break
else:
    print(f"Kubernetes cluster {CLUSTER_NAME} not found in project {PROJECT_ID}")
```

Note: Make sure to replace `<your-project-id>`, `<your-cluster-name>`, and `KEY_PATH` with your own values before running the code.

6. Verify that Kubernetes Web UI is disabled by accessing the Kubernetes dashboard URL. You should see an error message indicating that the dashboard is not available.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Kubernetes Web UI Is Disabled" for GCP using python.
