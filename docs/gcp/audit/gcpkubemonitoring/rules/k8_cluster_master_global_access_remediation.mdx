### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cluster Master Endpoint Should Not Be Global" for GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Go to the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) console.
2. Select the cluster for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.
3. Click on the "Edit" button on the top of the page.
4. Scroll down to the "Endpoint" section.
5. Under the "Master endpoint" section, select the "Regional" option.
6. Select the region where your cluster is located.
7. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, your cluster master endpoint will no longer be global and will be limited to the selected region. This will help to reduce the attack surface and improve the security of your GKE cluster.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cluster Master Endpoint Should Not Be Global" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Kubernetes Engine.

2. Select the cluster that you want to remediate.

3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.

4. Scroll down to the "Master endpoint" section.

5. Click on the "Customize" button next to the "Master endpoint" field.

6. Select "Regional" from the dropdown menu.

7. Choose the region where you want to create the endpoint.

8. Click on the "Save" button.

9. Verify that the endpoint has been updated to the regional endpoint by running the following command in the GCP CLI:

```
gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE]
```

Replace [CLUSTER_NAME] and [ZONE] with your cluster name and zone respectively.

10. Ensure that the endpoint is not global by running the following command:

```
gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE] | grep endpoint
```

If the endpoint is not global, you will see the regional endpoint in the output.

By following these steps, you will remediate the misconfiguration "Cluster Master Endpoint Should Not Be Global" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Cluster Master Endpoint Should Not Be Global" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Install the necessary libraries

```
!pip install google-cloud-container
```

Step 2: Import the necessary libraries

```python
from google.cloud import container_v1
from google.oauth2 import service_account
```

Step 3: Set up the credentials for authentication

```python
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/your/credentials.json')
```

Step 4: Create a client object for the Container API

```python
client = container_v1.ClusterManagerClient(credentials=credentials)
```

Step 5: Get the cluster details

```python
project_id = 'your-project-id'
zone = 'your-zone'
cluster_id = 'your-cluster-id'

cluster = client.get_cluster(project_id, zone, cluster_id)
```

Step 6: Check if the master endpoint is global

```python
if cluster.endpoint == 'global':
    cluster.endpoint = 'regional'
    update_request = container_v1.types.UpdateClusterRequest(cluster=cluster, update_mask={'paths':['endpoint']})
    operation = client.update_cluster(update_request)
    operation.result()
```

Step 7: Verify if the master endpoint is updated to regional

```python
updated_cluster = client.get_cluster(project_id, zone, cluster_id)
print(f"Master endpoint is now {updated_cluster.endpoint}")
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Cluster Master Endpoint Should Not Be Global" for GCP using Python.
