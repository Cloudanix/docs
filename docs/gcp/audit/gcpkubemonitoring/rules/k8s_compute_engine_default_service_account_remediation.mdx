### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your browser, navigate to the Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/), and sign in with your Google account.

2. Navigate to Kubernetes Engine: From the main navigation menu, select "Kubernetes Engine" > "Clusters". This will display a list of all the Kubernetes clusters that are currently deployed in your Google Cloud account.

3. Check the Service Account: For each cluster, click on the cluster name to open its configuration settings. Scroll down to the "Security" section and look for the "Service Account" setting. If the service account is set to "Default", then the cluster is using the default service account.

4. Repeat for all Clusters: Repeat the above step for all the Kubernetes clusters deployed within your Google Cloud account. If any of them are using the default service account, they are misconfigured.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. This will provide you with the necessary command-line tools to interact with resources hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

2. Authenticate your SDK with GCP. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to authenticate your SDK.

3. List all the GKE clusters in your project by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud container clusters list
   ```
   This will display a list of all the GKE clusters in your project.

4. For each cluster, check the service account associated with it. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER_NAME] --format="value[delimiter='\n'](nodeConfig.serviceAccount)"
   ```
   Replace `[CLUSTER_NAME]` with the name of your cluster. If the output of this command is "default", then the cluster is using the default service account.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: You will need the `google-auth`, `google-auth-httplib2`, `google-auth-oauthlib`, `google-api-python-client`, `oauthlib`, and `requests-oauthlib` libraries. You can install them using pip:

```python
pip install --upgrade google-auth google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client oauthlib requests-oauthlib
```

2. Authenticate and create a service: Before you can interact with GCP resources, you need to authenticate. You can do this using a service account key file. Once authenticated, you can create a service to interact with the GKE API:

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient import discovery

# Load the service account key file
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    '/path/to/keyfile.json')

# Create a service to interact with the GKE API
service = discovery.build('container', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

3. List all GKE clusters: You can use the `projects().locations().clusters().list()` method to list all GKE clusters in a given project and location:

```python
# Replace 'project-id' and 'location' with your project ID and location
response = service.projects().locations().clusters().list(
    parent='projects/project-id/locations/location').execute()

clusters = response['clusters']
```

4. Check the service account for each cluster: For each cluster, you can check the `serviceAccount` field to see if it's using the default service account. If it is, then this is a misconfiguration:

```python
for cluster in clusters:
    if 'serviceAccount' in cluster:
        if cluster['serviceAccount'] == 'default':
            print(f"Cluster {cluster['name']} is using the default service account.")
```

This script will print out the names of all GKE clusters that are using the default service account, indicating a misconfiguration.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure GKE Clusters Are Not Using Default Service Account" in GCP using GCP console, please follow the below steps:

Step 1: Login to GCP console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).

Step 2: Navigate to Kubernetes Engine and select the cluster that is using the default service account.

Step 3: Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.

Step 4: Scroll down to the "Node Pools" section and click on the "default-pool" node pool.

Step 5: Under the "Node pool details" section, click on the "Edit" button.

Step 6: Scroll down to the "Security" section and expand it.

Step 7: Under the "Service account" section, select "Create a new service account".

Step 8: In the "Service account name" field, enter a name for the new service account.

Step 9: In the "Service account ID" field, enter a unique ID for the new service account.

Step 10: Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Step 11: Repeat the above steps for all the node pools that are using the default service account.

Step 12: Once all the node pools have been updated, click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page to save the changes to the cluster.

By following these steps, the misconfiguration "Ensure GKE Clusters Are Not Using Default Service Account" will be remediated for GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure GKE Clusters Are Not Using Default Service Account" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell from the GCP console.
2. Run the following command to list all the GKE clusters in your project:

   ```
   gcloud container clusters list
   ```

3. Identify the GKE cluster that is using the default service account.
4. Run the following command to get the details of the GKE cluster:

   ```
   gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER_NAME]
   ```

   Replace [CLUSTER_NAME] with the name of the GKE cluster that you identified in step 3.

5. Check the output for the field `serviceAccount` under `nodePools`. If the value is `default`, then the GKE cluster is using the default service account.

6. To remediate this misconfiguration, you need to create a new service account and then assign it to the GKE cluster. Run the following command to create a new service account:

   ```
   gcloud iam service-accounts create [SA-NAME] --display-name [SA-DISPLAY-NAME]
   ```

   Replace [SA-NAME] with the name of the new service account and [SA-DISPLAY-NAME] with a display name for the service account.

7. Run the following command to assign the new service account to the GKE cluster:

   ```
   gcloud container clusters update [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE] --service-account [SA-EMAIL]
   ```

   Replace [CLUSTER_NAME] with the name of the GKE cluster, [ZONE] with the zone in which the cluster is located, and [SA-EMAIL] with the email address of the new service account.

8. Verify that the new service account is assigned to the GKE cluster by running the command in step 4 again and checking the value of the `serviceAccount` field.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure GKE Clusters Are Not Using Default Service Account" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure GKE Clusters Are Not Using Default Service Account" in GCP, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. Install the necessary Python packages: `google-auth` and `google-api-python-client`.

2. Authenticate with the GCP API using a service account that has the necessary permissions to manage GKE clusters. You can create a service account and download its credentials in JSON format from the GCP console.

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/credentials.json',
    scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform']
)

gke_service = build('container', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

3. List all GKE clusters in the project and check if any of them are using the default service account.

```python
project_id = 'my-project-id'
clusters = gke_service.projects().locations().clusters().list(parent=f"projects/{project_id}/locations/-").execute()

for cluster in clusters.get('clusters', []):
    if cluster.get('nodeConfig', {}).get('serviceAccount', '') == 'default':
        # The cluster is using the default service account
        # Remediation steps go here
```

4. To remediate the misconfiguration, you can create a new service account and assign it to the GKE cluster.

```python
from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError

new_service_account = 'my-new-service-account@my-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

cluster_name = 'my-cluster'
zone = 'us-central1-c'

try:
    gke_service.projects().zones().clusters().update(
        name=f"projects/{project_id}/locations/{zone}/clusters/{cluster_name}",
        body={
            'nodeConfig': {
                'serviceAccount': new_service_account
            }
        }
    ).execute()
    print(f"Updated service account for cluster {cluster_name}")
except HttpError as error:
    print(f"Error updating service account for cluster {cluster_name}: {error}")
```

Note: You will need to have the necessary IAM permissions to create and assign service accounts to GKE clusters.
