### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console.

2. Navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section. Here, you will find a list of all your Kubernetes clusters.

3. Click on the specific cluster you want to check for Pod Security Policy (PSP). This will open the cluster details page.

4. In the cluster details page, look for the "Pod Security Policy" section. If it is enabled, you will see the status as "Enabled". If it is not enabled, the status will be "Disabled".

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and configure Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, you can authenticate your Google Cloud account by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. After successful authentication, you need to set your project ID to the project where your Kubernetes cluster is running. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual project ID.

3. Now, you can list all the clusters in your project by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud container clusters list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all clusters along with their details.

4. To check if Pod Security Policy is enabled in a specific cluster, you can describe the cluster and look for the `PodSecurityPolicyConfig` field. Run the following command:

   ```
   gcloud container clusters describe [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [CLUSTER_ZONE]
   ```

   Replace `[CLUSTER_NAME]` with the name of your cluster and `[CLUSTER_ZONE]` with the zone of your cluster. If Pod Security Policy is enabled, you will see `enabled: true` under the `PodSecurityPolicyConfig` field. If it's not enabled, you will see `enabled: false` or the field might not be present at all.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: You will need the Kubernetes Python client to interact with the Kubernetes API. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install kubernetes
```

2. Connect to the Kubernetes API: You will need to create a configuration object to connect to the Kubernetes API. This can be done using the `config.load_kube_config()` function if you are running the script from a machine that has kubectl installed and configured. If you are running the script from within a pod in the cluster, you can use the `config.load_incluster_config()` function.

```python
from kubernetes import client, config

# Load the kube config from the machine running the script
config.load_kube_config()

# Create an API client object
api = client.ExtensionsV1beta1Api()
```

3. Query the Kubernetes API for Pod Security Policies: You can use the `list_pod_security_policy()` function to get a list of all Pod Security Policies in the cluster.

```python
psps = api.list_pod_security_policy()
```

4. Check if any Pod Security Policies are enabled: You can iterate over the list of Pod Security Policies and check if any of them are enabled. If no Pod Security Policies are enabled, this is a misconfiguration.

```python
if not psps.items:
    print("Misconfiguration Detected: No Pod Security Policies are enabled.")
else:
    for psp in psps.items:
        print(f"Pod Security Policy {psp.metadata.name} is enabled.")
```

This script will print a message for each enabled Pod Security Policy, or a warning message if no Pod Security Policies are enabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the Pod Security Policy misconfiguration in GCP using the GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) console.

2. Select the GKE cluster for which you want to enable Pod Security Policy.

3. Click on the "Edit" button.

4. Under the "Security" section, click on "Enable Pod Security Policy".

5. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

6. Once the changes are applied, Pod Security Policy will be enabled for the selected GKE cluster.

Note: Enabling Pod Security Policy may cause some of your existing workloads to fail if they do not meet the policy requirements. Therefore, it is recommended to test the policy with a small set of workloads before enabling it for all workloads in the cluster.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Pod Security Policy Should Be Enabled" misconfiguration in GCP, you can follow these step-by-step instructions using GCP CLI:

1. First, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create and modify Pod Security Policies in your GCP project.

2. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section.

3. Select the cluster where you want to enable Pod Security Policy.

4. Click the "Edit" button to edit the cluster configuration.

5. Scroll down to the "Security" section and click "Enable Pod Security Policy".

6. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

7. Alternatively, you can use the GCP CLI to enable Pod Security Policy for your GCP cluster. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
gcloud beta container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME --enable-pod-security-policy
```

Make sure to replace `CLUSTER_NAME` with the name of your GCP cluster.

8. Verify that Pod Security Policy has been enabled by running the following command:

```
gcloud beta container clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME --zone ZONE | grep podSecurityPolicyConfig
```

Make sure to replace `CLUSTER_NAME` with the name of your GCP cluster and `ZONE` with the zone where your cluster is located.

If the output shows `"podSecurityPolicyConfig": {"enabled": true}`, then Pod Security Policy has been successfully enabled for your GCP cluster.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of Pod Security Policy not being enabled in GCP using Python, follow the below steps:

1. Install the required Python libraries: 

   ```
   pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-cloud-container google-cloud-logging
   ```

2. Authenticate to the GCP project using a service account:

   ```
   from google.oauth2 import service_account

   credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path_to_service_account_file>')
   ```

3. Connect to the Kubernetes cluster using the Kubernetes Python client:

   ```
   from kubernetes import client, config

   config.load_kube_config()
   v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
   ```

4. Create a Pod Security Policy object:

   ```
   psp = {
      "apiVersion": "policy/v1beta1",
      "kind": "PodSecurityPolicy",
      "metadata": {
         "name": "restricted-psp"
      },
      "spec": {
         "privileged": False,
         "allowPrivilegeEscalation": False,
         "requiredDropCapabilities": [
            "ALL"
         ],
         "fsGroup": {
            "rule": "RunAsAny"
         },
         "runAsUser": {
            "rule": "MustRunAsNonRoot"
         },
         "seLinux": {
            "rule": "RunAsAny"
         },
         "supplementalGroups": {
            "rule": "RunAsAny"
         },
         "volumes": [
            "configMap",
            "downwardAPI",
            "emptyDir",
            "persistentVolumeClaim",
            "secret"
         ]
      }
   }
   ```

5. Create the Pod Security Policy object in the Kubernetes cluster:

   ```
   api_instance = client.PolicyV1beta1Api()
   api_instance.create_pod_security_policy(psp)
   ```

6. Verify that the Pod Security Policy object was created successfully:

   ```
   api_response = api_instance.list_pod_security_policy()
   for item in api_response.items:
      print(item.metadata.name)
   ```

Once the above steps are completed, the Pod Security Policy will be enabled in the GCP Kubernetes cluster, and all pods will be required to adhere to the policy.
