### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console.

2. Navigate to the Pub/Sub service. You can do this by clicking on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines at the top left corner), then scroll down and click on "Pub/Sub".

3. In the Pub/Sub page, click on "Subscriptions" on the left-hand side menu. This will display a list of all the Pub/Sub subscriptions in your GCP project.

4. For each subscription, check the "Message Ordering" column. If the value is set to "False", then the PubSub subscription does not have message ordering set to true.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI if you haven't done so already. You can do this by following the instructions provided by Google Cloud at https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install.

2. Once the SDK is installed and configured, open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the following command to list all PubSub subscriptions in your project:

   ```
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions list
   ```

4. For each subscription, check the 'enableMessageOrdering' field. If it is set to 'false' or not present, then message ordering is not enabled for that subscription. You can do this by running the following command for each subscription:

   ```
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions describe [SUBSCRIPTION_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[SUBSCRIPTION_NAME]` with the name of the subscription you want to check. The output will include a field 'enableMessageOrdering'. If it is 'false' or not present, then message ordering is not enabled for that subscription.

#### Using Python

1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Pub/Sub: Before you can start writing a Python script to detect the misconfiguration, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK and the Python Client for Pub/Sub. You can do this using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-sdk google-cloud-pubsub
   ```

2. Authenticate with Google Cloud: You need to authenticate with Google Cloud using your service account key. You can do this in your Python script like this:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

   # TODO: replace 'your-service-account-key.json' with the path to your service account key
   publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient.from_service_account_json('your-service-account-key.json')
   ```

3. List all Pub/Sub subscriptions: You can list all Pub/Sub subscriptions in your project using the `list_subscriptions` method:

   ```python
   project_path = publisher.project_path('your-project-id')

   for subscription in publisher.list_subscriptions(project_path):
       print(subscription.name)
   ```

4. Check if message ordering is enabled: You can check if message ordering is enabled for each subscription using the `enable_message_ordering` attribute:

   ```python
   for subscription in publisher.list_subscriptions(project_path):
       if not subscription.enable_message_ordering:
           print(f'Message ordering is not enabled for subscription {subscription.name}')
   ```

This script will print the names of all subscriptions in your project where message ordering is not enabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "PubSub Subscriptions Should Have Set Message Ordering To True" for GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the GCP console and navigate to the Pub/Sub section.
2. Click on the subscription that needs to be remediated.
3. In the subscription details page, click on the "Edit" button on the top.
4. In the "Edit subscription" page, scroll down to the "Delivery" section.
5. In the "Delivery" section, enable the "Enable message ordering" checkbox.
6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

After following the above steps, the message ordering for the subscription will be enabled and the misconfiguration will be remediated.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of PubSub subscriptions not having message ordering set to true in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Use the following command to list all the subscriptions in the project:

```
gcloud pubsub subscriptions list
```

3. Identify the subscription(s) that do not have message ordering set to true.

4. Use the following command to update the subscription(s) to enable message ordering:

```
gcloud pubsub subscriptions update [SUBSCRIPTION_NAME] --enable-message-ordering
```

Replace [SUBSCRIPTION_NAME] with the name of the subscription that needs to be updated.

5. Verify the changes by using the following command to describe the subscription:

```
gcloud pubsub subscriptions describe [SUBSCRIPTION_NAME]
```

This will display the details of the subscription, including the "enableMessageOrdering" field set to "true".

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of PubSub subscriptions not having message ordering set to true in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "PubSub Subscriptions Should Have Set Message Ordering To True" in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to authenticate and authorize your Python script to access your GCP project. You can use the `google-auth` and `google-cloud-pubsub` libraries to achieve this.

```python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
from google.oauth2 import service_account

# Replace the below values with your GCP project ID and service account credentials file path
PROJECT_ID = 'your-project-id'
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = '/path/to/your/credentials.json'

# Authenticate and authorize the Python script
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE)
publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient(credentials=credentials)
subscriber = pubsub_v1.SubscriberClient(credentials=credentials)
```

2. Next, you need to list all the subscriptions in your GCP project using the `list_subscriptions` method of the `SubscriberClient` class.

```python
# List all the subscriptions in your GCP project
project_path = f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}"
for subscription in subscriber.list_subscriptions(request={"project": project_path}):
    print(f"Subscription: {subscription.name}")
```

3. For each subscription, you need to check if the message ordering is set to true or not using the `get_subscription` method of the `SubscriberClient` class.

```python
# Check if the message ordering is set to true for each subscription
for subscription in subscriber.list_subscriptions(request={"project": project_path}):
    subscription_path = subscription.name
    subscription = subscriber.get_subscription(request={"subscription": subscription_path})
    if subscription.enable_message_ordering:
        print(f"Message ordering is enabled for subscription {subscription_path}")
    else:
        print(f"Message ordering is not enabled for subscription {subscription_path}")
```

4. If the message ordering is not enabled for a subscription, you need to update the subscription to enable message ordering using the `update_subscription` method of the `SubscriberClient` class.

```python
# Enable message ordering for the subscription
if not subscription.enable_message_ordering:
    update_mask = {"paths": ["enable_message_ordering"]}
    subscription.enable_message_ordering = True
    subscriber.update_subscription(request={"subscription": subscription, "update_mask": update_mask})
    print(f"Message ordering is enabled for subscription {subscription_path}")
```

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "PubSub Subscriptions Should Have Set Message Ordering To True" in GCP using Python.
