### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Login to Google Cloud Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google Cloud account.

2. Navigate to Pub/Sub Topics: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner). Scroll down and click on "Pub/Sub" under the "Big Data" section. Then click on "Topics" to view all the Pub/Sub topics in your project.

3. Check Topic Details: Click on the name of the topic you want to check. This will open the topic details page. Here, you can see all the information related to the selected topic.

4. Check Encryption: In the topic details page, look for the "Encryption" section. If the topic is encrypted using a Customer-Managed Encryption Key (CMEK), it will display the key ring name, key name, and key version. If these fields are not present or empty, then the topic is not encrypted using CMEK.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK if you haven't done so already. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions provided.

2. Once the SDK is installed, open your terminal and authenticate your Google Cloud account by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to log in with your Google Cloud account.

3. Now, you can list all the PubSub topics in your project by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud pubsub topics list
   ```
   This will return a list of all the PubSub topics in your project.

4. To check if a specific PubSub topic is encrypted using CMEK, you need to describe the topic and look for the `kmsKeyName` field. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud pubsub topics describe [TOPIC_NAME]
   ```
   Replace `[TOPIC_NAME]` with the name of the topic you want to check. If the `kmsKeyName` field is present and contains a value, this means that the topic is encrypted using CMEK. If the field is not present or does not contain a value, this means that the topic is not encrypted using CMEK.

#### Using Python

1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Pub/Sub: Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Pub/Sub. You can install the Python client using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-pubsub
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and set up the client: In your Python script, you'll need to import the Pub/Sub library and set up a client using your project ID.

   ```python
   from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

   project_id = "your-project-id"
   client = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
   ```

3. List all Pub/Sub topics and check their encryption configuration: You can list all the Pub/Sub topics in your project and check their encryption configuration using the `get_topic` method. If the `kms_key_name` attribute is empty, the topic is not encrypted using CMEK.

   ```python
   for topic in client.list_topics(project_id):
       topic_detail = client.get_topic(topic.name)
       if not topic_detail.kms_key_name:
           print(f"Topic {topic.name} is not encrypted using CMEK.")
   ```

4. Run the script: Finally, run your script. If there are any Pub/Sub topics in your project that are not encrypted using CMEK, they will be printed out.

   Note: Make sure to replace "your-project-id" with your actual Google Cloud project ID. Also, ensure that the account running the script has the necessary permissions to view Pub/Sub topics and their configurations.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "PubSub Topics Should Be Encrypted Using CMEK" for GCP using GCP console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to your GCP console.
2. Navigate to the Pub/Sub page from the left-hand side menu.
3. Select the topic that you want to encrypt using CMEK.
4. Click on the "Edit" button present at the top of the page.
5. Scroll down to the "Encryption" section.
6. Click on the "Enable encryption" checkbox.
7. Select the "Customer-managed key" option from the dropdown.
8. Choose the CMEK key that you want to use for encryption from the "Key name" dropdown.
9. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Once you have completed these steps, your Pub/Sub topic will be encrypted using the selected CMEK key.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Set the project where the Pub/Sub topic is located:

```
gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
```

3. Retrieve the list of Pub/Sub topics in the project:

```
gcloud pubsub topics list
```

4. For each topic that does not have encryption enabled, enable encryption using the following command:

```
gcloud alpha pubsub topics update [TOPIC_NAME] --update-attribute=encryption_key_name=projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION]/keyRings/[KEYRING_NAME]/cryptoKeys/[KEY_NAME]
```

Replace `[TOPIC_NAME]` with the name of the Pub/Sub topic that needs to be encrypted, and replace `[PROJECT_ID]`, `[LOCATION]`, `[KEYRING_NAME]`, and `[KEY_NAME]` with the appropriate values for your project.

5. Verify that the encryption has been enabled for the topic by running the following command:

```
gcloud alpha pubsub topics describe [TOPIC_NAME]
```

The output should include the following line:

```
encryptionKeyName: projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION]/keyRings/[KEYRING_NAME]/cryptoKeys/[KEY_NAME]
```

This indicates that the topic is now encrypted using a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK).

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration where PubSub topics should be encrypted using CMEK in GCP using Python, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. First, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create a new key ring and key in the Cloud KMS service. 

2. Next, you will need to create a new key ring and key in the Cloud KMS service. You can do this using the following Python code:

```python
from google.cloud import kms_v1
from google.cloud.kms_v1 import enums

client = kms_v1.KeyManagementServiceClient()

# Replace [PROJECT_ID] with your GCP project ID
parent = client.location_path('[PROJECT_ID]', 'global')

# Replace [KEY_RING_ID] with a unique ID for your key ring
key_ring_id = '[KEY_RING_ID]'

# Create the key ring
key_ring = client.create_key_ring(parent, key_ring_id, {})

# Replace [KEY_ID] with a unique ID for your key
key_id = '[KEY_ID]'

# Create the key
purpose = enums.CryptoKey.CryptoKeyPurpose.ENCRYPT_DECRYPT
crypto_key = {'purpose': purpose, 'next_rotation_time': '2022-01-01T00:00:00Z'}
key = client.create_crypto_key(key_ring.name, key_id, crypto_key)
```

3. Once you have created the key ring and key, you can use it to encrypt your PubSub topics. You can do this using the following Python code:

```python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
from google.cloud.pubsub_v1 import types

# Replace [PROJECT_ID] with your GCP project ID
project_id = '[PROJECT_ID]'

# Replace [TOPIC_ID] with the ID of your PubSub topic
topic_id = '[TOPIC_ID]'

# Replace [KEY_RING_ID] with the ID of your key ring
key_ring_id = '[KEY_RING_ID]'

# Replace [KEY_ID] with the ID of your key
key_id = '[KEY_ID]'

# Create the topic client
publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()

# Create the topic name
topic_name = 'projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id}'.format(
    project_id=project_id,
    topic_id=topic_id,
)

# Create the encryption key
key_name = client.crypto_key_path(project_id, key_ring_id, key_id)
key = types.Key(
    version=1,
    key=client.encrypt(key_name, b'')[1]
)

# Create the topic with encryption enabled
topic = publisher.create_topic(
    request={
        'name': topic_name,
        'kms_key_name': key_name,
        'message_storage_policy': {
            'allowed_persistence_regions': ['us-central1'],
        },
    },
)

print('Topic created: {}'.format(topic))
```

4. Finally, you can verify that your PubSub topic is encrypted using CMEK by checking the topic details in the GCP Console or by using the following Python code:

```python
# Replace [PROJECT_ID] with your GCP project ID
project_id = '[PROJECT_ID]'

# Replace [TOPIC_ID] with the ID of your PubSub topic
topic_id = '[TOPIC_ID]'

# Get the topic client
publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()

# Get the topic name
topic_name = 'projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id}'.format(
    project_id=project_id,
    topic_id=topic_id,
)

# Get the topic details
topic = publisher.get_topic(request={'topic': topic_name})

# Check if encryption is enabled
if topic.encryption_config.kms_key_name:
    print('Encryption is enabled with key: {}'.format(topic.encryption_config.kms_key_name))
else:
    print('Encryption is not enabled')
``` 

These steps will help you remediate the misconfiguration where PubSub topics should be encrypted using CMEK in GCP using Python.
