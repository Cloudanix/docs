<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "PubSub Subscriptions Should Not Be Detached From Topics" for GCP using python, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to identify the detached subscriptions in GCP. You can use the following code to get the list of all detached subscriptions:

```python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

project_id = "your-project-id"
client = pubsub_v1.SubscriberClient()
project_path = f"projects/{project_id}"
response = client.list_subscriptions(project_path)
for subscription in response:
    if not subscription.topic:

```

2. Once you have identified the detached subscriptions, you can re-attach them to their respective topics using the following code:

```python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

project_id = "your-project-id"
client = pubsub_v1.SubscriberClient()
project_path = f"projects/{project_id}"
response = client.list_subscriptions(project_path)
for subscription in response:
    if not subscription.topic:
        print(f"Re-attaching subscription {subscription.name} to topic {subscription.topic}")
        topic_path = f"projects/{project_id}/topics/{subscription.topic.split('/')[-1]}"
        client.modify_push_config(subscription.name, topic_path=topic_path)
```

This code will loop through all the subscriptions in your project and re-attach the detached subscriptions to their respective topics.
