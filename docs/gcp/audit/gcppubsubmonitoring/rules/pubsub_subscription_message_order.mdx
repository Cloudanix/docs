<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of PubSub subscriptions not having message ordering set to true in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Use the following command to list all the subscriptions in the project:

```
gcloud pubsub subscriptions list
```

3. Identify the subscription(s) that do not have message ordering set to true.

4. Use the following command to update the subscription(s) to enable message ordering:

```
gcloud pubsub subscriptions update [SUBSCRIPTION_NAME] --enable-message-ordering
```

Replace [SUBSCRIPTION_NAME] with the name of the subscription that needs to be updated.

5. Verify the changes by using the following command to describe the subscription:

```
gcloud pubsub subscriptions describe [SUBSCRIPTION_NAME]
```

This will display the details of the subscription, including the "enableMessageOrdering" field set to "true".

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of PubSub subscriptions not having message ordering set to true in GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "PubSub Subscriptions Should Have Set Message Ordering To True" in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to authenticate and authorize your Python script to access your GCP project. You can use the `google-auth` and `google-cloud-pubsub` libraries to achieve this.

```python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
from google.oauth2 import service_account

# Replace the below values with your GCP project ID and service account credentials file path
PROJECT_ID = 'your-project-id'
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = '/path/to/your/credentials.json'

# Authenticate and authorize the Python script
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE)
publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient(credentials=credentials)
subscriber = pubsub_v1.SubscriberClient(credentials=credentials)
```

2. Next, you need to list all the subscriptions in your GCP project using the `list_subscriptions` method of the `SubscriberClient` class.

```python
# List all the subscriptions in your GCP project
project_path = f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}"
for subscription in subscriber.list_subscriptions(request={"project": project_path}):
    print(f"Subscription: {subscription.name}")
```

3. For each subscription, you need to check if the message ordering is set to true or not using the `get_subscription` method of the `SubscriberClient` class.

```python
# Check if the message ordering is set to true for each subscription
for subscription in subscriber.list_subscriptions(request={"project": project_path}):
    subscription_path = subscription.name
    subscription = subscriber.get_subscription(request={"subscription": subscription_path})
    if subscription.enable_message_ordering:
        print(f"Message ordering is enabled for subscription {subscription_path}")
    else:
        print(f"Message ordering is not enabled for subscription {subscription_path}")
```

4. If the message ordering is not enabled for a subscription, you need to update the subscription to enable message ordering using the `update_subscription` method of the `SubscriberClient` class.

```python
# Enable message ordering for the subscription
if not subscription.enable_message_ordering:
    update_mask = {"paths": ["enable_message_ordering"]}
    subscription.enable_message_ordering = True
    subscriber.update_subscription(request={"subscription": subscription, "update_mask": update_mask})
    print(f"Message ordering is enabled for subscription {subscription_path}")
```

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "PubSub Subscriptions Should Have Set Message Ordering To True" in GCP using Python.
