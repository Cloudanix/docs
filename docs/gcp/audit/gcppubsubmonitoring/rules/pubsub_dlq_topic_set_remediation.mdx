To remediate this misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to set up a dead letter topic:

```
gcloud pubsub topics create [DEAD_LETTER_TOPIC_NAME]

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "PubSub Subscriptions Should Have Dead Letter Queue Topic Set For Failed Messages" in GCP using python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to create a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) topic in GCP Pub/Sub. To do this, use the following code:

```python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

project_id = "your-project-id"
topic_name = "your-dlq-topic-name"

publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
topic_path = publisher.topic_path(project_id, topic_name)

topic = publisher.create_topic(request={"name": topic_path})
print("Created topic: {}".format(topic.name))
```

2. Once the DLQ topic is created, you need to update the subscription to use this DLQ topic for failed messages. To do this, use the following code:

```python
subscription_name = "your-subscription-name"
subscription_path = publisher.subscription_path(project_id, subscription_name)

update_mask = {"paths": ["dead_letter_policy.dead_letter_topic"]}

dead_letter_policy = {
    "dead_letter_topic": topic_path,
    "max_delivery_attempts": 5
}

subscription = publisher.update_subscription(
    request={
        "subscription": subscription_path,
        "update_mask": update_mask,
        "dead_letter_policy": dead_letter_policy
    }
)

print("Updated subscription: {}".format(subscription.name))
```

3. Finally, you can verify that the DLQ topic is set for the subscription using the following code:

```python
subscription = publisher.get_subscription(request={"subscription": subscription_path})
print("Subscription: {}".format(subscription.name))
print("DLQ topic: {}".format(subscription.dead_letter_policy.dead_letter_topic))
```

These steps will remediate the misconfiguration "PubSub Subscriptions Should Have Dead Letter Queue Topic Set For Failed Messages" in GCP using python.
