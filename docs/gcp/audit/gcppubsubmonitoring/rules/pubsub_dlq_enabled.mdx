<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of PubSub Subscriptions not having a Dead Letter Queue enabled in GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Pub/Sub section.
2. Select the subscription that needs to be remediated.
3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
4. Under the "Delivery retry policy" section, enable the "Dead-letter topic" option.
5. Select the topic that will be used as the Dead Letter Queue.
6. Click on the "Save" button.

Alternatively, you can use the gcloud command-line tool to remediate this misconfiguration. Follow the below steps:

1. Open the terminal and authenticate to your GCP account using the command: `gcloud auth login`.
2. Set the project that contains the Pub/Sub subscription using the command: `gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]`.
3. Enable the Dead Letter Queue for the subscription using the command: `gcloud pubsub subscriptions update [SUBSCRIPTION_NAME] --dead-letter-topic=[DEAD_LETTER_TOPIC_NAME] --dead-letter-ack-deadline=[ACK_DEADLINE]`.

Replace the following variables in the above command:
- [SUBSCRIPTION_NAME]: Name of the subscription that needs to be remediated.
- [DEAD_LETTER_TOPIC_NAME]: Name of the topic that will be used as the Dead Letter Queue.
- [ACK_DEADLINE]: Acknowledgement deadline for the Dead Letter Queue in seconds.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of PubSub Subscriptions not having a Dead Letter Queue enabled in GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of PubSub Subscriptions not having Dead Letter Queue enabled in GCP using Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
from google.api_core import retry
```

2. Set the project ID and subscription name:

```python
project_id = "your-project-id"
subscription_name = "your-subscription-name"
```

3. Create the PubSub client and subscription object:

```python
subscriber = pubsub_v1.SubscriberClient()
subscription_path = subscriber.subscription_path(project_id, subscription_name)
```

4. Check if the subscription already has a dead letter policy:

```python
subscription = subscriber.get_subscription(request={"subscription": subscription_path})
if subscription.dead_letter_policy:
    print("Dead letter policy already exists.")
    exit()
```

5. If the subscription does not have a dead letter policy, create one:

```python
dead_letter_topic = "projects/{}/topics/{}".format(project_id, "your-dead-letter-topic-name")
dead_letter_policy = {
    "dead_letter_topic": dead_letter_topic,
    "max_delivery_attempts": 10,
}
update_mask = {"paths": ["dead_letter_policy"]}
subscription.dead_letter_policy = dead_letter_policy
```

6. Update the subscription with the new dead letter policy:

```python
update_request = {
    "subscription": subscription,
    "update_mask": update_mask,
}
response = subscriber.update_subscription(request=update_request)
print("Dead letter policy has been enabled for the subscription.")
```

7. Handle any errors that may occur during the update process:

```python
def handle_error(exception):
    print(f"Error occurred: {exception}")
    return retry.RetryResult.RETRY_ON_EXCEPTION

retry_settings = retry.Retry(deadline=60, predicate=handle_error)
response = subscriber.update_subscription(request=update_request, retry=retry_settings)
```

Putting it all together, here's the complete code:

```python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
from google.api_core import retry

project_id = "your-project-id"
subscription_name = "your-subscription-name"

subscriber = pubsub_v1.SubscriberClient()
subscription_path = subscriber.subscription_path(project_id, subscription_name)

subscription = subscriber.get_subscription(request={"subscription": subscription_path})
if subscription.dead_letter_policy:
    print("Dead letter policy already exists.")
    exit()

dead_letter_topic = "projects/{}/topics/{}".format(project_id, "your-dead-letter-topic-name")
dead_letter_policy = {
    "dead_letter_topic": dead_letter_topic,
    "max_delivery_attempts": 10,
}
update_mask = {"paths": ["dead_letter_policy"]}
subscription.dead_letter_policy = dead_letter_policy

update_request = {
    "subscription": subscription,
    "update_mask": update_mask,
}

def handle_error(exception):
    print(f"Error occurred: {exception}")
    return retry.RetryResult.RETRY_ON_EXCEPTION

retry_settings = retry.Retry(deadline=60, predicate=handle_error)
response = subscriber.update_subscription(request=update_request, retry=retry_settings)

print("Dead letter policy has been enabled for the subscription.")
```

Note: Replace the placeholders "your-project-id", "your-subscription-name", and "your-dead-letter-topic-name" with your actual project ID, subscription name, and dead letter topic name, respectively.
