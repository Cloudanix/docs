### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Pub/Sub Subscriptions: From the main navigation menu, select "Pub/Sub" and then "Subscriptions". This will display a list of all the Pub/Sub subscriptions available within your selected project.

3. Check Subscription Details: Click on the name of the subscription you want to check. This will open the subscription details page. 

4. Check for Dead Letter Topic: In the subscription details page, look for the "Dead Letter Topic" field. If this field is empty or not set, then the PubSub subscription does not have a Dead Letter Queue Topic set for failed messages.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI if you haven't done so already. You can do this by following the instructions provided by Google Cloud at https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install.

2. Once the SDK is installed and configured, open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the following command to list all the PubSub subscriptions in your project:

   ```
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions list
   ```

4. For each subscription, run the following command to get the details of the subscription:

   ```
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions describe [SUBSCRIPTION_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[SUBSCRIPTION_NAME]` with the name of the subscription you want to check.

   In the output, look for the `deadLetterPolicy` field. If this field is not present or if the `deadLetterTopic` field within it is not set, then the subscription does not have a dead letter queue topic set for failed messages.

#### Using Python

1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Pub/Sub: Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and the Python client for Pub/Sub. You can install the Python client with pip:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-pubsub
   ```

2. Import Required Libraries: Import the necessary Python libraries. You will need the `google.cloud` library for accessing the Pub/Sub service.

   ```python
   from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
   ```

3. Initialize Pub/Sub Client: Initialize the Pub/Sub client with your project ID. This will be used to interact with your Pub/Sub resources.

   ```python
   project_id = "your-project-id"
   subscriber = pubsub_v1.SubscriberClient()
   project_path = subscriber.project_path(project_id)
   ```

4. Check for Dead Letter Policy: Iterate over all the subscriptions in your project and check if they have a dead letter policy set. If the `dead_letter_policy` attribute is `None`, then the subscription does not have a dead letter queue set.

   ```python
   for subscription in subscriber.list_subscriptions(project_path):
       if subscription.dead_letter_policy is None:
           print(f"Subscription {subscription.name} does not have a dead letter queue set.")
   ```
   
This script will print out the names of all subscriptions in your project that do not have a dead letter queue set.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the steps to remediate the misconfiguration "PubSub Subscriptions Should Have Dead Letter Queue Topic Set For Failed Messages" in GCP using GCP console:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project that contains the Pub/Sub subscription that needs to be remediated.

2. In the left-hand navigation menu, select "Pub/Sub" and then select "Subscriptions".

3. Find the subscription that needs to be remediated and click on its name to open its details page.

4. Scroll down to the "Dead-letter topic" section and click on the "Edit" button.

5. In the "Edit dead-letter topic" dialog box, select the topic that will be used as the dead-letter queue for failed messages.

6. Click on the "Save" button to confirm the changes.

7. Verify that the dead-letter topic has been set correctly by checking the subscription details page.

Congratulations, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "PubSub Subscriptions Should Have Dead Letter Queue Topic Set For Failed Messages" in GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to set up a dead letter topic:

```
gcloud pubsub topics create [DEAD_LETTER_TOPIC_NAME]
```

Replace `[DEAD_LETTER_TOPIC_NAME]` with a name for your dead letter topic.

3. Run the following command to create a subscription with a dead letter topic:

```
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create [SUBSCRIPTION_NAME] --topic [TOPIC_NAME] --dead-letter-topic [DEAD_LETTER_TOPIC_NAME]
```

Replace `[SUBSCRIPTION_NAME]` with the name of your subscription, `[TOPIC_NAME]` with the name of your topic, and `[DEAD_LETTER_TOPIC_NAME]` with the name of your dead letter topic.

4. Verify that the subscription was created with the dead letter topic by running the following command:

```
gcloud pubsub subscriptions describe [SUBSCRIPTION_NAME]
```

This should display information about your subscription, including the dead letter topic.

Your PubSub subscription should now have a dead letter queue topic set for failed messages.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "PubSub Subscriptions Should Have Dead Letter Queue Topic Set For Failed Messages" in GCP using python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to create a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) topic in GCP Pub/Sub. To do this, use the following code:

```python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

project_id = "your-project-id"
topic_name = "your-dlq-topic-name"

publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
topic_path = publisher.topic_path(project_id, topic_name)

topic = publisher.create_topic(request={"name": topic_path})
print("Created topic: {}".format(topic.name))
```

2. Once the DLQ topic is created, you need to update the subscription to use this DLQ topic for failed messages. To do this, use the following code:

```python
subscription_name = "your-subscription-name"
subscription_path = publisher.subscription_path(project_id, subscription_name)

update_mask = {"paths": ["dead_letter_policy.dead_letter_topic"]}

dead_letter_policy = {
    "dead_letter_topic": topic_path,
    "max_delivery_attempts": 5
}

subscription = publisher.update_subscription(
    request={
        "subscription": subscription_path,
        "update_mask": update_mask,
        "dead_letter_policy": dead_letter_policy
    }
)

print("Updated subscription: {}".format(subscription.name))
```

3. Finally, you can verify that the DLQ topic is set for the subscription using the following code:

```python
subscription = publisher.get_subscription(request={"subscription": subscription_path})
print("Subscription: {}".format(subscription.name))
print("DLQ topic: {}".format(subscription.dead_letter_policy.dead_letter_topic))
```

These steps will remediate the misconfiguration "PubSub Subscriptions Should Have Dead Letter Queue Topic Set For Failed Messages" in GCP using python.
