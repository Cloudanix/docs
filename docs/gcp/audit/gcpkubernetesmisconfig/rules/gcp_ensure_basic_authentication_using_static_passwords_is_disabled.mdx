### More Info:

Kubernetes provides the option to use client certificates for user authentication. However as there is no way to revoke these certificates when a user leaves an organization or loses their credential, they are not suitable for this purpose. It is not possible to fully disable client certificate use within a cluster as it is used for component to component authentication.
