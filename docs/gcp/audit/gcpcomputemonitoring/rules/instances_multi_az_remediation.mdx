### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Login to Google Cloud Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google Cloud account.

2. Navigate to Compute Engine: From the left-hand side menu, click on "Compute Engine" and then "VM instances". This will display a list of all your virtual machine instances.

3. Check Instance Details: For each instance, click on the instance name to open its details page. Here, you can see the configuration of the instance.

4. Check Zone: In the instance details page, look for the "Zone" field. If all your instances are in the same zone, then they are not Multi-AZ. For a Multi-AZ setup, your instances should be spread across multiple zones.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate the Google Cloud SDK CLI: The Google Cloud SDK includes the gcloud command-line tool, which you can use to manage your Google Cloud resources. You can download and install the SDK on your local machine and then authenticate it with your Google Cloud account.

    ```
    gcloud auth login
    ```

2. List all the instances in your project: Use the following command to list all the instances in your project. This will give you a list of all the instances along with their details.

    ```
    gcloud compute instances list
    ```

3. Check the zone of each instance: The output of the above command will include a column for the zone of each instance. If an instance is in a single zone, it is not Multi-AZ.

4. Check the instance template: If an instance is part of an instance group, it might be using an instance template. You can check the instance template to see if it is configured for Multi-AZ. Use the following command to describe the instance template:

    ```
    gcloud compute instance-templates describe [TEMPLATE_NAME]
    ```

    In the output, look for the distributionPolicy.zones field. If this field is not present or only includes one zone, the instance is not Multi-AZ.

#### Using Python

To check if instances are Multi-AZ in Compute using Python scripts, you can use the boto3 library for AWS, azure-sdk for Azure, and google-cloud-sdk for GCP. Here are the steps:

1. AWS:
   - Import the boto3 library and create an EC2 resource object.
   - Use the describe_instances() method to get a list of all instances.
   - Check the 'Placement' attribute of each instance. If the 'Tenancy' key is not 'host', the instance is not Multi-AZ.
   ```python
   import boto3
   ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
   for instance in ec2.instances.all():
       if instance.placement['Tenancy'] != 'host':
           print(f"Instance {instance.id} is not Multi-AZ")
   ```

2. Azure:
   - Import the azure.mgmt.compute library and create a ComputeManagementClient object.
   - Use the virtual_machines.list_all() method to get a list of all VMs.
   - Check the 'zones' attribute of each VM. If it is None, the VM is not Multi-AZ.
   ```python
   from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
   compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
   for vm in compute_client.virtual_machines.list_all():
       if vm.zones is None:
           print(f"VM {vm.name} is not Multi-AZ")
   ```

3. GCP:
   - Import the google.cloud.compute_v1 library and create a InstancesClient object.
   - Use the list() method to get a list of all instances.
   - Check the 'zone' attribute of each instance. If it does not contain multiple zones, the instance is not Multi-AZ.
   ```python
   from google.cloud import compute_v1
   instances_client = compute_v1.InstancesClient()
   for instance in instances_client.list(project=project, zone=zone):
       if len(instance.zone.split('/')) <= 4:
           print(f"Instance {instance.name} is not Multi-AZ")
   ```
Please replace the placeholders like 'credentials', 'subscription_id', 'project', and 'zone' with your actual values.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

In GCP, the equivalent of Multi AZ in AWS is the "Regional Managed Instance Group". To remediate the misconfiguration of instances not being Multi AZ in GCP, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP console and go to the Compute Engine section.
2. Click on "Instance groups" in the left-hand menu.
3. Click on the name of the instance group that you want to make Multi AZ.
4. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
5. In the "Autohealing" section, select "On" for "Enable autohealing".
6. In the "Location" section, select the region where you want the instance group to be Multi AZ.
7. In the "Size" section, set the "Number of instances" to the desired number of instances for the Multi AZ group.
8. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page.

Once you have completed these steps, your instance group will be Multi AZ and will automatically heal and distribute instances across multiple zones within the selected region.

#### Using CLI

In GCP, the concept of Multi-AZ is called "High Availability" and can be achieved by using Managed Instance Groups. To remediate the misconfiguration, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell from the GCP Console.
2. Create a Managed Instance Group using the following command:

```
gcloud compute instance-groups managed create [GROUP_NAME] \
    --size [GROUP_SIZE] \
    --template [INSTANCE_TEMPLATE] \
    --base-instance-name [INSTANCE_NAME] \
    --zone [ZONE] \
    --health-check [HEALTH_CHECK]
```

Replace the placeholders in the command with the following values:
- [GROUP_NAME]: Name of the Managed Instance Group you want to create
- [GROUP_SIZE]: Number of instances you want to create in the group
- [INSTANCE_TEMPLATE]: Name of the instance template you want to use to create instances in the group
- [INSTANCE_NAME]: Base name of the instances in the group
- [ZONE]: Zone in which you want to create the instances
- [HEALTH_CHECK]: Name of the health check that will be used to verify the health of the instances

3. Once the Managed Instance Group is created, you can configure it to use the Multi-AZ feature by setting the `autohealingPolicies` property. Use the following command to set the property:

```
gcloud compute instance-groups managed update [GROUP_NAME] \
    --update-autoscaling-policy \
    --autohealing-policies health-check=[HEALTH_CHECK],initial-delay-sec=120
```

Replace the [GROUP_NAME] and [HEALTH_CHECK] placeholders with the actual values.

4. Verify that the Managed Instance Group has been configured for High Availability by checking the Instance Group details in the GCP Console.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of instances not being Multi-AZ in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

In GCP, the equivalent of Multi-AZ is called "Regionalization". To remediate the misconfiguration of instances not being multi-AZ, you can use the following steps:

1. Identify the instances that are not regionalized. You can use the following Python code to get a list of all the instances that are not regionalized:

```
from google.cloud import compute_v1

compute_client = compute_v1.InstancesClient()

project_id = '[PROJECT_ID]'
zone = '[ZONE]'

instances = compute_client.list(project=project_id, zone=zone).items

for instance in instances:
    if not instance.region:
        print(f"Instance {instance.name} is not regionalized.")
```

Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` and `[ZONE]` with your GCP project ID and the zone in which your instances are running.

2. For each instance that is not regionalized, create a new instance in a regionalized zone and migrate the data.

```
from google.cloud import compute_v1

compute_client = compute_v1.InstancesClient()

project_id = '[PROJECT_ID]'
zone = '[ZONE]'
region = '[REGION]'

instances = compute_client.list(project=project_id, zone=zone).items

for instance in instances:
    if not instance.region:
        new_instance_name = f"{instance.name}-regionalized"
        new_instance_body = {
            "name": new_instance_name,
            "machine_type": f"zones/{region}/machineTypes/{instance.machine_type.split('/')[-1]}",
            "network_interfaces": instance.network_interfaces,
            "disks": instance.disks,
            "metadata": instance.metadata,
            "service_accounts": instance.service_accounts,
            "tags": instance.tags,
            "labels": instance.labels,
            "scheduling": instance.scheduling,
            "shielded_instance_config": instance.shielded_instance_config,
            "reservation_affinity": instance.reservation_affinity,
            "guest_accelerators": instance.guest_accelerators,
            "deletion_protection": instance.deletion_protection
        }

        operation = compute_client.insert(project=project_id, zone=region, body=new_instance_body)
        operation.wait()

        # Migrate data from the old instance to the new instance

        # Delete the old instance
        operation = compute_client.delete(project=project_id, zone=zone, instance=instance.name)
        operation.wait()

        print(f"Instance {instance.name} has been regionalized to {new_instance_name}.")
```

Replace `[PROJECT_ID]`, `[ZONE]` and `[REGION]` with your GCP project ID, the zone in which your instances are running, and the region to which you want to regionalize your instances. 

Note that this code will create a new instance in the specified region, migrate the data from the old instance to the new instance, and then delete the old instance. You should test this code thoroughly in a non-production environment before running it in production.
