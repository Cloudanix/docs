### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, visit the Google Cloud Platform Console, and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to the Compute Engine: From the left-hand side menu, select "Compute Engine" and then "VM instances". This will display a list of all the virtual machine instances that are currently running in your Google Cloud Platform account.

3. Check for Confidential Computing: For each instance, check the "Confidential VM" column. If the column is marked as "Yes", then the instance has Confidential Computing enabled. If the column is marked as "No", then the instance does not have Confidential Computing enabled.

4. Repeat for all instances: Go through each instance in the list and check the "Confidential VM" column. Make a note of any instances that do not have Confidential Computing enabled, as these may be misconfigured.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Authenticate your GCP account using the following command. This will open a new window in your web browser asking you to log in with your Google account and allow the Google Cloud SDK to access it.
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. Set your GCP project ID to the project you want to check. Replace 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID' with your actual project ID.
   ```
   gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

4. Run the following command to list all the compute instances in your project and their confidential computing status. If the 'confidentialInstanceConfig' field is 'ENABLED' for an instance, it means that confidential computing is enabled for that instance. If it's 'DISABLED' or not present, it means that confidential computing is not enabled.
   ```
   gcloud compute instances list --format='table(name, confidentialInstanceConfig)'
   ```
   Note: Confidential computing is a feature that allows you to encrypt your data while it's being processed. It's currently only available on certain machine types in GCP.

#### Using Python

To check if Compute Instances have Confidential Computing enabled in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you can use the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) or the Google Cloud Client Libraries for Python. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client Libraries:**
   First, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK and the Python client libraries on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions provided in the official Google Cloud documentation.

2. **Authenticate your SDK:**
   Use the `gcloud auth login` command to authenticate your Google Cloud SDK with your Google Cloud account. This will allow you to interact with your Google Cloud resources from your local machine.

3. **List Compute Instances:**
   Use the `gcloud compute instances list` command to list all the Compute Instances in your Google Cloud account. This will return a list of all the Compute Instances along with their details.

Python script to list instances:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def list_instances(project_id, zone):
    instances_client = compute_v1.InstancesClient()
    instances = instances_client.list(project=project_id, zone=zone)
    for instance in instances:
        print(f"Instance: {instance.name}")
```

4. **Check Confidential Computing:**
   For each Compute Instance, check if the `confidential_instance_config` attribute is enabled. If it is enabled, then the Compute Instance has Confidential Computing enabled.

Python script to check Confidential Computing:

```python
def check_confidential_computing(project_id, zone, instance_name):
    instances_client = compute_v1.InstancesClient()
    instance = instances_client.get(project=project_id, zone=zone, instance=instance_name)
    if instance.confidential_instance_config.enable_confidential_compute:
        print(f"Confidential Computing is enabled for instance: {instance.name}")
    else:
        print(f"Confidential Computing is not enabled for instance: {instance.name}")
```

Please replace `project_id`, `zone`, and `instance_name` with your actual project ID, zone, and instance name.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure That Compute Instances Have Confidential Computing Enabled" for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP Console and navigate to the Compute Engine page.
2. Select the instance(s) for which you want to enable Confidential Computing.
3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
4. Scroll down to the "Confidential Computing" section and select the checkbox next to "Enable Confidential VMs".
5. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page to save the changes.

Once you have completed the above steps, Confidential Computing will be enabled for the selected instance(s) in GCP.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure That Compute Instances Have Confidential Computing Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.

2. Run the following command to enable Confidential Computing for the specific instance:

```
gcloud beta compute instances update INSTANCE_NAME --confidential-computing
```

Replace `INSTANCE_NAME` with the name of the instance for which you want to enable Confidential Computing.

3. Verify that Confidential Computing is enabled for the instance by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute instances describe INSTANCE_NAME --format="get(confidentialComputing.enable)"
```

Replace `INSTANCE_NAME` with the name of the instance for which you enabled Confidential Computing.

If the output of the command is `True`, then Confidential Computing is enabled for the instance. If the output is `False`, then you need to troubleshoot and ensure that the command was executed correctly.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure That Compute Instances Have Confidential Computing Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure That Compute Instances Have Confidential Computing Enabled" for GCP using Python, you can follow the steps given below:

1. First, you need to create a new instance with Confidential Computing enabled. You can do this using the following Python code:

```python
from googleapiclient import discovery
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials

credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
service = discovery.build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)

project = 'your-project-id'
zone = 'us-central1-a'
instance_name = 'your-instance-name'
machine_type = 'n2d-standard-2'

config = {
    'confidentialInstanceConfig': {
        'enableConfidentialCompute': True
    }
}

instance_body = {
    'name': instance_name,
    'machineType': f'zones/{zone}/machineTypes/{machine_type}',
    'confidentialInstanceConfig': config
}

request = service.instances().insert(project=project, zone=zone, body=instance_body)
response = request.execute()

print(response)
```

2. Once the new instance is created, you can migrate your workload to this new instance. You can use tools like CloudEndure or manually migrate your workload.

3. Finally, you need to delete the old instance without Confidential Computing enabled. You can do this using the following Python code:

```python
from googleapiclient import discovery
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials

credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
service = discovery.build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)

project = 'your-project-id'
zone = 'us-central1-a'
instance_name = 'your-old-instance-name'

request = service.instances().delete(project=project, zone=zone, instance=instance_name)
response = request.execute()

print(response)
```

Note: Before deleting the old instance, make sure to take a backup of any data or configuration that you might need.
