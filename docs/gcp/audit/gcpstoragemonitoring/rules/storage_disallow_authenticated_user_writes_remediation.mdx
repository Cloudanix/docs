### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser and navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com). Use your Google account credentials to log in.

2. Navigate to the Storage Browser: Once you're logged in, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines) in the top left corner of the console. Scroll down and click on "Storage" under the "Storage" section. Then click on "Browser".

3. Check Bucket Permissions: In the Storage Browser, you will see a list of all your storage buckets. Click on the name of the bucket you want to check. Once the bucket details page opens, click on the "Permissions" tab.

4. Review the Permissions: In the permissions tab, look for any permissions that have "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers" as the member. If the role associated with these members includes "storage.objects.create", "storage.objects.delete", or "storage.objects.update", then the bucket allows all authenticated users to write in storage.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate the Google Cloud SDK: You need to have the Google Cloud SDK installed on your local machine. After installation, authenticate your SDK using the command `gcloud auth login`. This will open a new browser window for you to log in to your Google account.

2. List all the buckets in your project: Use the command `gsutil ls` to list all the buckets in your current project. This will return a list of all the bucket URLs.

3. Check the IAM policies for each bucket: For each bucket URL returned in the previous step, run the command `gsutil iam get gs://[BUCKET_NAME]`. Replace `[BUCKET_NAME]` with the name of your bucket. This will return a JSON object with all the IAM policies attached to the bucket.

4. Look for any policies that allow all authenticated users to write: In the JSON object returned in the previous step, look for any bindings where the `members` field includes `allAuthenticatedUsers` and the `role` field includes `roles/storage.objectCreator` or `roles/storage.objectAdmin`. If such a binding exists, then the bucket allows all authenticated users to write.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```python
pip install boto3 google-cloud-storage azure-storage-blob
```

2. AWS S3: Use the boto3 library to check the bucket policy. Here is a sample script:

```python
import boto3
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def check_bucket_policy(bucket_name):
    policy = s3.get_bucket_policy(Bucket=bucket_name)['Policy']
    if 'AWS":"*' in policy and 's3:PutObject' in policy:
        print(f'Bucket {bucket_name} allows all authenticated users to write.')
```

3. Google Cloud Storage: Use the google-cloud-storage library to check the bucket policy. Here is a sample script:

```python
from google.cloud import storage

def check_bucket_policy(bucket_name):
    client = storage.Client()
    bucket = client.get_bucket(bucket_name)
    policy = bucket.get_iam_policy()
    for role in policy:
        if role == 'roles/storage.objectCreator' and 'allUsers' in policy[role]:
            print(f'Bucket {bucket_name} allows all authenticated users to write.')
```

4. Azure Blob Storage: Use the azure-storage-blob library to check the container policy. Here is a sample script:

```python
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

def check_container_policy(storage_account_name, container_name):
    blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(account_url=f"https://{storage_account_name}.blob.core.windows.net", credential=your_credential)
    container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(container_name)
    acl = container_client.get_container_access_policy()
    for access_policy in acl:
        if access_policy.permission == 'rwd' and access_policy.start_time is None and access_policy.expiry_time is None:
            print(f'Container {container_name} allows all authenticated users to write.')
```

Remember to replace `your_credential` with your actual Azure Storage account key.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the issue of GCP buckets allowing all authenticated users to write, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the GCP console and select the project where the bucket is located.

2. Navigate to the Cloud Storage section and select the bucket that needs to be remediated.

3. Click on the "Permissions" tab on the left-hand side of the screen.

4. Under the "Members" section, find the "allAuthenticatedUsers" entry and click on the pencil icon next to it to edit the permissions.

5. In the "Add members" field, type "allUsers" and select the "Storage Object Viewer" role from the dropdown menu.

6. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

7. Next, find the "allAuthenticatedUsers" entry again, and this time, click on the trash can icon to remove it.

8. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

9. Finally, verify that the bucket no longer allows all authenticated users to write by attempting to upload a file to the bucket with an authenticated user account that does not have write access. The upload should fail with an access denied error.

By following these steps, you should be able to remediate the misconfiguration of GCP buckets allowing all authenticated users to write.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Buckets Should Not Allow All Authenticated Users to Write" in GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to list all the buckets in your project:

```gcloud storage buckets list```

3. Choose the bucket that you want to remediate.

4. Run the following command to remove all authenticated users' write access from the bucket:

```gsutil iam ch allAuthenticatedUsers:objectAdmin gs://[BUCKET_NAME]```

Note: Replace [BUCKET_NAME] with the actual name of your bucket.

5. Verify that the remediation is successful by running the following command:

```gsutil iam get gs://[BUCKET_NAME]```

This command should return the access control list (ACL) for the bucket, which should not contain any entry for allAuthenticatedUsers with the role objectAdmin.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Buckets Should Not Allow All Authenticated Users to Write" in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Buckets Should Not Allow All Authenticated Users to Write" in GCP using python, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to install the Google Cloud Storage python library using the following command:

```
pip install google-cloud-storage
```

2. Next, you need to authenticate with your GCP account using the following command:

```
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path_to_service_account_key_file>')
```

3. Now, you can list all the buckets in your GCP project using the following code:

```
from google.cloud import storage

storage_client = storage.Client(credentials=credentials)
buckets = storage_client.list_buckets()

for bucket in buckets:
    print(bucket.name)
```

4. Once you have identified the bucket that allows all authenticated users to write, you can update its permissions using the following code:

```
from google.cloud import storage
from google.cloud.storage import Bucket

storage_client = storage.Client(credentials=credentials)
bucket = Bucket(storage_client, '<bucket_name>')

all_authenticated_users = storage.all_authenticated()

bucket.acl.loaded = False
bucket.acl.save(acl=all_authenticated_users, role='READER')
```

This code will remove the "WRITER" role for all authenticated users and grant them only the "READER" role. This will ensure that they cannot write to the bucket. 

Note: Make sure to replace `<path_to_service_account_key_file>` and `<bucket_name>` with the appropriate values in the code.
