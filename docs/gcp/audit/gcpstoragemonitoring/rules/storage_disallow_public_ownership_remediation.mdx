### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console.

2. Navigate to the "Storage" section. This can be found under the "Storage" option in the left-hand side menu.

3. In the Storage section, you will see a list of all your buckets. Click on the name of the bucket that you want to check.

4. In the bucket details page, navigate to the "Permissions" tab. Here, you can see all the permissions associated with the bucket. If you see "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers" with the role of "Storage Object Viewer" or "Storage Object Creator", it means the bucket allows public ownership.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate the Google Cloud SDK: The Google Cloud SDK includes the gcloud command-line tool, which is necessary to interact with Google Cloud resources. You can install it by following the instructions provided by Google Cloud. After installation, authenticate the SDK using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. List all the buckets in your project: Use the `gsutil ls` command to list all the buckets in your project. The command will return a list of all the bucket URLs. The command is as follows:
   ```
   gsutil ls
   ```
3. Check the IAM policies for each bucket: For each bucket URL returned by the previous command, check the IAM policies using the `gsutil iam get` command. This command will return a JSON object that includes all the IAM policies for the bucket. The command is as follows:
   ```
   gsutil iam get gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
   ```
   Replace `[BUCKET_NAME]` with the name of your bucket.

4. Check for public ownership: In the JSON object returned by the previous command, look for any bindings that have the role `roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner` and the member `allUsers` or `allAuthenticatedUsers`. If such a binding exists, then the bucket allows public ownership.

#### Using Python

1. AWS S3:

You can use the boto3 library in Python to interact with AWS services. Here's a script to check if any S3 bucket allows public ownership:

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def check_public_buckets():
    buckets = s3.list_buckets()
    for bucket in buckets['Buckets']:
        acl = s3.get_bucket_acl(Bucket=bucket['Name'])
        for grant in acl['Grants']:
            if grant['Grantee']['Type'] == 'Group' and 'AllUsers' in grant['Grantee']['URI']:
                print(f"Bucket {bucket['Name']} allows public ownership")

check_public_buckets()
```

2. Azure Blob Storage:

You can use the azure-storage-blob library in Python to interact with Azure Blob Storage. Here's a script to check if any blob container allows public access:

```python
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string("my_connection_string")

def check_public_containers():
    all_containers = blob_service_client.list_containers(include_metadata=True)
    for container in all_containers:
        acl = blob_service_client.get_container_access_policy(container.name)
        if acl.public_access:
            print(f"Container {container.name} allows public ownership")

check_public_containers()
```

3. Google Cloud Storage:

You can use the google-cloud-storage library in Python to interact with Google Cloud Storage. Here's a script to check if any bucket allows public ownership:

```python
from google.cloud import storage

storage_client = storage.Client()

def check_public_buckets():
    buckets = storage_client.list_buckets()
    for bucket in buckets:
        policy = bucket.get_iam_policy()
        for role in policy:
            if 'allUsers' in policy[role]:
                print(f"Bucket {bucket.name} allows public ownership")

check_public_buckets()
```

Please replace "my_connection_string" with your actual Azure connection string. Also, ensure that you have the necessary permissions and the correct configuration to access these resources.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Buckets Should Not Allow Public Ownership" for GCP using GCP console, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the Cloud Storage page.

2. Select the bucket that you want to remediate.

3. Click on the "Permissions" tab.

4. Under the "Members" section, look for any member or group that has the "Storage Object Viewer" or "Storage Object Admin" role assigned.

5. Remove the member or group by clicking on the "X" icon next to their name.

6. Repeat Step 4 and Step 5 for all members or groups that have any Storage Object role assigned.

7. Click on the "Add" button to add a new member or group.

8. In the "Add members" dialog box, enter the email address of the member or group that you want to grant access to.

9. Select the appropriate role for the member or group from the "Select a role" drop-down menu.

10. Click on the "Add" button to add the member or group to the bucket.

11. Repeat Step 8 to Step 10 for all members or groups that need access to the bucket.

12. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Buckets Should Not Allow Public Ownership" for GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Buckets Should Not Allow Public Ownership" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project in which the bucket is located.

2. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon on the top right corner of the console.

3. In the Cloud Shell, run the following command to list all the buckets in the project:
```
gsutil ls
```

4. Identify the bucket that has public ownership.

5. Run the following command to remove public ownership from the bucket:
```
gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
```
Replace [BUCKET_NAME] with the name of the bucket that has public ownership.

6. Verify that public ownership has been removed by running the following command:
```
gsutil iam get gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
```
Replace [BUCKET_NAME] with the name of the bucket that has public ownership.

7. If the command output shows that allUsers has no permissions on the bucket, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration.

Note: If you want to prevent public ownership from being set on new buckets, you can set a bucket-level policy that denies the allUsers group the storage.objects.get permission.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Buckets Should Not Allow Public Ownership" in GCP, we can follow these steps using Python:

1. Install the Google Cloud Storage library for Python using the following command:

   ```
   pip install google-cloud-storage
   ```

2. Create a service account with the necessary permissions to access the GCP project where the bucket is located. Download the JSON key file for the service account and save it securely.

3. Use the following Python code to check if any of the buckets in the project have public ownership:

   ```
   from google.cloud import storage

   # Replace the following values with your project ID and the path to your JSON key file
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   key_path = '/path/to/your/keyfile.json'

   # Authenticate with the service account
   client = storage.Client.from_service_account_json(key_path)

   # Get a list of all the buckets in the project
   buckets = client.list_buckets(project=project_id)

   # Check if any of the buckets have public ownership
   for bucket in buckets:
       if bucket.iam_configuration.public_access == 'Public':
           print(f'Bucket {bucket.name} has public ownership.')
   ```

4. If any buckets have public ownership, use the following Python code to remove the public access:

   ```
   from google.cloud import storage

   # Replace the following values with your project ID and the path to your JSON key file
   project_id = 'your-project-id'
   key_path = '/path/to/your/keyfile.json'

   # Authenticate with the service account
   client = storage.Client.from_service_account_json(key_path)

   # Get a list of all the buckets in the project
   buckets = client.list_buckets(project=project_id)

   # Remove public access from any buckets that have it
   for bucket in buckets:
       if bucket.iam_configuration.public_access == 'Public':
           bucket.iam_configuration.public_access = 'None'
           bucket.patch()
           print(f'Public access removed from bucket {bucket.name}.')
   ```

5. Run the code to remediate the misconfiguration. Verify that the buckets no longer have public ownership by checking their IAM settings in the GCP Console.
