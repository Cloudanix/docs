How to remove public reader to GCP Storage bucket?

#### Using GCP Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console using your GCP account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Cloud Storage section by selecting "Storage" from the main menu.
3. Locate and select the bucket where the `allUsers` entity has `reader` permissions.
   (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Buckets Should Not Allow All Users Reads" Policy.)
4. In the bucket details page, click on the "Permissions" tab.
5. Under the "Bucket Policy" section, click on the "Edit Bucket Policy" button.
6. Review the existing bucket policy and identify the entry that grants `allUsers` `reader` permissions.
7. Modify the bucket policy to remove or restrict the `reader` permissions for the `allUsers` entity. There are two options:
   a. Remove the `allUsers` entry: Find the entry that grants `allUsers` `reader` permissions and delete it from the policy.
   b. Modify the `allUsers` entry to limit permissions: If the `allUsers` entry has specific actions or permissions specified, modify it to restrict the permissions to a more secure level or remove the entry entirely.
8. After making the necessary changes to the bucket policy, click on the "Save" button to update the policy.
9. Review the modified bucket policy to ensure that the `allUsers` entity no longer has `reader` permissions.
10. Test the access permissions to the bucket to confirm that `allUsers` no longer has read access and their access is restricted.
