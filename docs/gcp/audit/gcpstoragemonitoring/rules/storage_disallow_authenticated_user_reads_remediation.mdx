### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console.

2. Navigate to the "Storage" section. This can be found under the "Storage" option in the left-hand side menu.

3. Once you are in the "Storage" section, you will see a list of all your storage buckets. Click on the name of the bucket that you want to check.

4. In the bucket details page, click on the "Permissions" tab. Here, you can see all the permissions that are currently set for the bucket. If you see "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers" with the role of "Storage Object Viewer" or "Storage Legacy Bucket Reader", it means that the bucket allows all authenticated user reads.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Authenticate your CLI with your GCP account using the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the instructions and log in with your GCP account credentials.

3. List all the buckets in your GCP project using the following command:
   ```
   gsutil ls -p [PROJECT_ID]
   ```
   Replace [PROJECT_ID] with your actual GCP project ID.

4. Check the IAM policy for each bucket and look for "allAuthenticatedUsers" in the role members. You can do this using the following command:
   ```
   gsutil iam get gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
   ```
   Replace [BUCKET_NAME] with the name of each bucket you want to check. If "allAuthenticatedUsers" is listed in the role members, then the bucket allows all authenticated user reads.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```python
pip install google-cloud-storage
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the client: In your Python script, you need to import the necessary libraries and initialize the client. Here is how you can do it:

```python
from google.cloud import storage

def create_storage_client():
    return storage.Client()
```

3. Get the list of buckets and check their IAM policies: Now, you can get the list of all the buckets in your project and check their IAM policies. If a bucket's IAM policy allows all authenticated users to read, it is a misconfiguration. Here is how you can do it:

```python
def check_bucket_iam_policies(client):
    buckets = client.list_buckets()
    for bucket in buckets:
        policy = bucket.get_iam_policy()
        for role in policy:
            members = policy[role]
            for member in members:
                if member == 'allAuthenticatedUsers':
                    print(f'Bucket {bucket.name} allows all authenticated users to read.')
```

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run the script to check the misconfiguration. Here is how you can do it:

```python
def main():
    client = create_storage_client()
    check_bucket_iam_policies(client)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script will print the names of all the buckets that allow all authenticated users to read. If no such bucket is found, it will not print anything.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Buckets Should Not Allow All Authenticated User Reads" for GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP console and go to the Cloud Storage page.
2. Select the bucket for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.
3. Click on the "Permissions" tab.
4. Under the "Members" section, locate the "allAuthenticatedUsers" entry.
5. Click on the pencil icon next to the "allAuthenticatedUsers" entry to edit its permissions.
6. In the "Select a role" dropdown, select "Storage Legacy Bucket Reader".
7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

By doing this, you are removing the read permission for all authenticated users and granting only the Storage Legacy Bucket Reader role permission to read the bucket.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Buckets should not allow all authenticated user reads" in GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to list all the buckets in your project:

   ```
   gsutil ls
   ```

3. Identify the bucket that allows all authenticated user reads.

4. Run the following command to remove the allAuthenticatedUsers entity from the bucket's IAM policy:

   ```
   gsutil iam ch -d allAuthenticatedUsers gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
   ```

   Replace [BUCKET_NAME] with the name of the bucket that you want to remediate.

5. Verify that the allAuthenticatedUsers entity has been removed from the bucket's IAM policy by running the following command:

   ```
   gsutil iam get gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
   ```

   Replace [BUCKET_NAME] with the name of the bucket that you remediated.

6. Repeat these steps for any other buckets that allow all authenticated user reads.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration "Buckets should not allow all authenticated user reads" in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the issue of buckets allowing all authenticated user reads in GCP using Python, you can use the following steps:

1. Install the Google Cloud Storage Python library by running the following command:

```
pip install google-cloud-storage
```

2. Authenticate with your GCP account by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key file. You can create a service account and download the key file from the GCP console.

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/keyfile.json
```

3. Use the `google-cloud-storage` library to get a list of all buckets in your project.

```python
from google.cloud import storage

client = storage.Client()
buckets = client.list_buckets()
```

4. For each bucket, check if it allows all authenticated users to read. If it does, update the bucket's IAM policy to remove the `allAuthenticatedUsers` role from the `roles/storage.objectViewer` role.

```python
for bucket in buckets:
    policy = bucket.get_iam_policy()
    binding = policy.bindings.get("roles/storage.objectViewer")
    if binding and "allAuthenticatedUsers" in binding.members:
        binding.members.remove("allAuthenticatedUsers")
        bucket.set_iam_policy(policy)
```

5. Verify that the issue has been remediated by checking the IAM policy for each bucket.

```python
for bucket in buckets:
    policy = bucket.get_iam_policy()
    binding = policy.bindings.get("roles/storage.objectViewer")
    if binding and "allAuthenticatedUsers" in binding.members:
        print(f"Bucket {bucket.name} still allows all authenticated user reads")
    else:
        print(f"Bucket {bucket.name} has been remediated")
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the issue of buckets allowing all authenticated user reads in GCP using Python.
