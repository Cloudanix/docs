### More Info:

Ensures Storage bucket policies do not allow global write, delete, or read permissions. Storage buckets can be configured to allow the global principal to access the bucket via the bucket policy. This policy should be restricted only to known users or accounts.

### Remediation

How to remove global access to GCP Storage bucket?

#### Using GCP Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console using your GCP account credentials.
2. Navigate to the Cloud Storage section by selecting "Storage" from the main menu.
3. Locate and select the bucket that allows global principal access.
   (In the Cloudanix Console, navigate to "Misconfig" page and look for Affected Assets for "Bucket Should Not Allow Global Access" Policy.)
4. In the bucket details page, click on the "Permissions" tab.
5. Under the "Bucket Policy" section, click on the "Edit Bucket Policy" button.
6. Review the existing bucket policy and identify any entries that allow global principal access.
7. Modify the bucket policy to restrict access. Here are two options:
   a. Remove the global principal entry: Find the entry that grants access to all users (e.g., `allUsers` or `allAuthenticatedUsers`) and delete it from the policy. This will revoke access to the bucket for global principals.
   b. Limit access to specific identities or groups: Replace the global principal entry with more specific identities or groups that should have access to the bucket. Use the appropriate IAM identities or Google Group email addresses in the policy.
8. After making the necessary changes to the bucket policy, click on the "Save" button to update the policy.
9. Review the modified bucket policy to ensure that access is restricted to the intended principals.
10. Test the access permissions to the bucket to confirm that global principals no longer have access.
11. Repeat these steps for any other buckets that allow global principal access.
