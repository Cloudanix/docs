### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Sign in to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console.
2. Navigate to the "Storage" section. You can do this by clicking on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines on the top left corner), then scroll down and click on "Storage" under the "STORAGE" section.
3. In the Storage section, you will see a list of all your storage buckets. Click on each bucket to view its details.
4. In the bucket details page, click on the "PERMISSIONS" tab. Here, you can see all the permissions associated with the bucket. If "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers" have "Storage Object Writer" or "Storage Legacy Bucket Writer" roles, then the bucket has write configuration.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK if you haven't done so already. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions for your specific operating system.

2. Once the SDK is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and authenticate your Google Cloud account by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to log in with your Google account.

3. Now, you can list all your buckets in Google Cloud Storage by running the following command:
   ```
   gsutil ls
   ```
   This will return a list of all your buckets.

4. To check the write configuration of each bucket, you can use the `gsutil iam get` command followed by the bucket's URL. This will return the bucket's IAM policy, which includes its write permissions. Here's an example:
   ```
   gsutil iam get gs://your-bucket-name
   ```
   In the output, look for bindings with the "storage.objects.create" role. If the members for this role include "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers", then the bucket has a write configuration.

#### Using Python

1. AWS S3:
   - Install the AWS SDK (boto3) for Python using pip: `pip install boto3`
   - Use the following Python script to list all S3 buckets and check their write permissions:

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

buckets = s3.list_buckets()

for bucket in buckets['Buckets']:
    acl = s3.get_bucket_acl(Bucket=bucket['Name'])
    for grant in acl['Grants']:
        if grant['Permission'] == 'WRITE':
            print(f"Bucket {bucket['Name']} has write permissions")
```

2. Azure Blob Storage:
   - Install the Azure SDK for Python using pip: `pip install azure-storage-blob`
   - Use the following Python script to list all Blob Storage containers and check their public access level:

```python
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string("my_connection_string")

containers = blob_service_client.list_containers()

for container in containers:
    acl = blob_service_client.get_container_access_policy(container.name)
    if acl.public_access == 'blob' or acl.public_access == 'container':
        print(f"Container {container.name} has write permissions")
```

3. Google Cloud Storage:
   - Install the Google Cloud SDK for Python using pip: `pip install google-cloud-storage`
   - Use the following Python script to list all GCS buckets and check their IAM policies:

```python
from google.cloud import storage

storage_client = storage.Client()

buckets = storage_client.list_buckets()

for bucket in buckets:
    policy = bucket.get_iam_policy()
    for role in policy:
        if 'roles/storage.objectCreator' in policy[role]:
            print(f"Bucket {bucket.name} has write permissions")
```

Please replace `"my_connection_string"` with your actual Azure connection string. Also, ensure that you have the necessary permissions and the correct configuration to access these resources.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To list all buckets which have write configuration in GCP, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP Console and navigate to the Cloud Storage page.
2. In the left navigation pane, click on "Storage".
3. Click on the "Buckets" tab.
4. In the "Filter Buckets" search box, type "bindings:writer" and press Enter.
5. This will list all the buckets with write configuration.

To remediate this misconfiguration in GCP, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP Console and navigate to the Cloud Storage page.
2. In the left navigation pane, click on "Storage".
3. Click on the bucket that has write configuration.
4. Click on the "Permissions" tab.
5. In the "Add members" field, enter the email address of the user or service account that you want to grant access to.
6. Select the appropriate role for the user or service account from the "Select a role" drop-down menu.
7. Click the "Add" button to grant the user or service account access to the bucket.
8. Remove any unnecessary write permissions from the bucket by clicking the "Edit" button next to the relevant member and selecting the appropriate role from the "Select a role" drop-down menu.
9. Click the "Save" button to save the changes.

Repeat these steps for all the buckets that have write configuration.

#### Using CLI

To list all buckets which have Write Configuration enabled in GCP, you can use the following command in the GCP CLI:

```
gsutil ls -L | grep -B 3 -i "allUsers:WRITE"
```

This command will list all the buckets with Write Configuration enabled. To remediate this issue, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP Console and navigate to the Cloud Storage page.
2. Click on the name of the bucket that has Write Configuration enabled.
3. Click on the "Permissions" tab.
4. Under the "Public access prevention" section, select "Enforced by organization policy".
5. Click "Save".

This will prevent any public user from having Write Configuration access to the bucket.

#### Using Python

To list all the buckets which have write configuration in GCP, you can use the following Python code:

```python
from google.cloud import storage

# create a client object
client = storage.Client()

# list all the buckets
buckets = list(client.list_buckets())

# iterate over the buckets and check if it has write configuration
for bucket in buckets:
    bucket_acl = bucket.acl
    for entry in bucket_acl:
        if entry.role == "WRITER":
            print(f"{bucket.name} has write configuration")
```

To remediate this misconfiguration, you can remove the `WRITER` role from the bucket's ACL. You can use the following Python code to do this:

```python
from google.cloud import storage

# create a client object
client = storage.Client()

# get the bucket object
bucket = client.get_bucket('bucket-name')

# get the bucket's ACL
bucket_acl = bucket.acl

# remove the writer role from the bucket's ACL
bucket_acl.all().revoke_role('WRITER')

# save the updated ACL
bucket_acl.save()
```

Note: Make sure to replace `bucket-name` with the actual name of the bucket. Also, make sure you have the necessary permissions to modify the bucket's ACL.
