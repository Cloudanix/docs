### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of not taking frequent snapshots of BigQuery tables in GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP Console and select your project.
2. Navigate to the BigQuery section of the console.
3. Click on the dataset that contains the table you want to snapshot.
4. Select the table that you want to snapshot.
5. Click on the "More" button located on the right side of the screen.
6. Select "Export" from the dropdown menu.
7. In the "Export to Cloud Storage" window, select the "Snapshot" option.
8. Choose the frequency at which you want to take the snapshots (daily, weekly, or monthly).
9. Select the destination Cloud Storage bucket where you want to store the snapshots.
10. Click on the "Create" button to create the snapshot schedule.

After following these steps, snapshots of the selected BigQuery table will be taken according to the frequency you specified and stored in the designated Cloud Storage bucket. This will provide redundancy and ensure that you have a backup of your table in case of any data loss or corruption.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of not taking frequent snapshots of GCP BigQuery tables, follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the BigQuery section.

2. Select the dataset that contains the table you want to snapshot.

3. Click on the table you want to snapshot.

4. In the table details page, click on the "Create Snapshot" button.

5. In the "Create Snapshot" dialog box, give the snapshot a name and description.

6. Choose the snapshot expiration time and frequency of the snapshot.

7. Click on the "Create" button to create the snapshot.

8. Verify that the snapshot has been created by navigating to the "Snapshots" tab in the table details page.

9. Repeat this process for all the tables in the dataset that need to be snapped.

10. To automate the snapshot creation process, create a script using the GCP CLI that runs the "bq mk --snapshot" command for each table in the dataset.

11. Schedule the script to run at the desired frequency using a cron job or any other scheduling tool.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of not taking frequent snapshots of GCP BigQuery tables and ensure redundancy of data.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of not taking frequent snapshots of GCP BigQuery tables, you can use the following Python script:

1. First, you need to import the necessary libraries:

```
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.cloud.bigquery.table import Table
```

2. Create a `bigquery` client object using the following code:

```
client = bigquery.Client()
```

3. Get a list of all the tables in your project using the following code:

```
tables = client.list_tables("<your-project>")
```

4. For each table in the list, check if a snapshot has been taken within a specified time frame (e.g. 24 hours). If a snapshot has not been taken, create a new snapshot using the following code:

```
for table in tables:
    snapshot_time = <get last snapshot time for table>
    if <current time> - snapshot_time > <24 hours>:
        snapshot_ref = client.snapshot_table(table.reference)
```

5. Finally, set up a cron job to run this script at a specified interval (e.g. daily) to ensure that snapshots are taken frequently.

Note: You will need to replace `<your-project>`, `<get last snapshot time for table>`, `<current time>`, and `<24 hours>` with the appropriate values for your specific use case.
