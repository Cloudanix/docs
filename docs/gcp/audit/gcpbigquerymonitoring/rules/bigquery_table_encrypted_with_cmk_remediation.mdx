1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in with your GCP account. If you don't have an account, you'll need to create one.

2. Navigate to BigQuery: From the GCP Console dashboard, select the project that you want to examine from the project drop-down list, then navigate to BigQuery service by clicking on the hamburger menu at the top left corner, then select "BigQuery" under the "Big Data" section.

3. Check Dataset Details: In the BigQuery dashboard, you will see a list of all your datasets. Click on the name of the dataset that you want to check. This will open the "Dataset details" page. 

4. Check Encryption: In the "Dataset details" page, look for the "Encryption" section. If the dataset is encrypted with a customer-managed key, it will be listed here. If the "Google-managed key" is listed, it means that the dataset is not encrypted with a customer-managed key.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine and authenticate it. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, you can authenticate it using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. List all BigQuery datasets: Use the following command to list all the datasets in a specific project. Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your project ID.
   ```
   gcloud bigquery datasets list --project=[PROJECT_ID]
   ```
   This command will return a list of all datasets in the specified project.

3. List all tables in a dataset: For each dataset, list all the tables using the following command. Replace `[DATASET_ID]` with your dataset ID.
   ```
   gcloud bigquery tables list [DATASET_ID] --project=[PROJECT_ID]
   ```
   This command will return a list of all tables in the specified dataset.

4. Check the encryption configuration of each table: For each table, check the encryption configuration using the following command. Replace `[TABLE_ID]` with your table ID.
   ```
   gcloud bigquery tables describe [TABLE_ID] --dataset-id=[DATASET_ID] --project=[PROJECT_ID]
   ```
   In the output, look for the "encryptionConfiguration" field. If this field is missing or if it does not contain a "kmsKeyName" field, then the table is not encrypted with a customer-managed key.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary libraries: You will need the `google-cloud-bigquery` library to interact with BigQuery. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install google-cloud-bigquery
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the BigQuery client:

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery

# Initialize a BigQuery client
client = bigquery.Client()
```

3. Fetch all the datasets and tables in the project:

```python
datasets = list(client.list_datasets())  # Make an API request.
tables = []
for dataset in datasets:
    dataset_ref = client.dataset(dataset.dataset_id)
    tables.extend(list(client.list_tables(dataset_ref)))  # Make an API request.
```

4. Check the encryption configuration for each table:

```python
for table in tables:
    table_ref = client.dataset(table.dataset_id).table(table.table_id)
    table = client.get_table(table_ref)  # Make an API request.
    if table.encryption_configuration is None or table.encryption_configuration.kms_key_name is None:
        print(f"Table {table.table_id} is not encrypted with a customer-managed key.")
```

This script will print out the IDs of all tables that are not encrypted with a customer-managed key. If no tables are printed, then all tables are correctly encrypted.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "GCP BigQuery Tables Should Be Encrypted With Customer Managed Keys", you can follow the below steps:

1. Log in to your GCP console.

2. Navigate to the BigQuery section.

3. Select the dataset that contains the tables you want to encrypt.

4. Click on the "Show Info Panel" button (i) next to the dataset name.

5. In the "Encryption" section, click on the "Edit" button.

6. Select the "Customer-managed encryption keys" option.

7. Click on the "Create or select a key" button.

8. Choose an existing key or create a new one.

9. Click on the "Save" button.

10. Repeat the above steps for each table in the dataset.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "GCP BigQuery Tables Should Be Encrypted With Customer Managed Keys" and ensure that your BigQuery tables are encrypted with customer-managed keys.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of GCP BigQuery tables not being encrypted with customer-managed keys, you can follow the below steps using GCP CLI:

1. Firstly, create a customer-managed encryption key in Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) using the following command:

```
gcloud kms keyrings create [KEYRING_NAME] --location [LOCATION]
gcloud kms keys create [KEY_NAME] --location [LOCATION] --keyring [KEYRING_NAME] --purpose encryption
```

Replace `[KEYRING_NAME]`, `[LOCATION]` and `[KEY_NAME]` with your preferred values.

2. Next, grant the BigQuery service account the necessary permissions to use the encryption key by running the following command:

```
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding [KEY_NAME] --location [LOCATION] --keyring [KEYRING_NAME] --member serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] --role roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter
```

Replace `[KEYRING_NAME]`, `[LOCATION]`, `[KEY_NAME]` and `[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]` with your preferred values.

3. Now, create a new BigQuery dataset or update an existing one to use the customer-managed encryption key by running the following command:

```
bq update --default_table_expiration [INTEGER_VALUE] --description [DESCRIPTION] --encryption_kms_key_name projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION]/keyRings/[KEYRING_NAME]/cryptoKeys/[KEY_NAME] [DATASET_NAME]
```

Replace `[INTEGER_VALUE]`, `[DESCRIPTION]`, `[PROJECT_ID]`, `[LOCATION]`, `[KEYRING_NAME]`, `[KEY_NAME]` and `[DATASET_NAME]` with your preferred values.

4. Finally, ensure that all existing tables in the dataset are encrypted with the customer-managed key by running the following command:

```
bq update --table_kms_key projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION]/keyRings/[KEYRING_NAME]/cryptoKeys/[KEY_NAME] [DATASET_NAME].[TABLE_NAME]
```

Replace `[PROJECT_ID]`, `[LOCATION]`, `[KEYRING_NAME]`, `[KEY_NAME]`, `[DATASET_NAME]` and `[TABLE_NAME]` with your preferred values.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of GCP BigQuery tables not being encrypted with customer-managed keys.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of GCP BigQuery Tables not being encrypted with customer managed keys, you can follow the below steps using Python:

1. First, you need to create a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) in the Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) using the following code:

```python
from google.cloud import kms_v1
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path-to-service-account-key-file>')
kms_client = kms_v1.KeyManagementServiceClient(credentials=credentials)

parent = kms_client.key_ring_path('<project-id>', '<location>', '<key-ring>')
purpose = kms_v1.CryptoKey.CryptoKeyPurpose.ENCRYPT_DECRYPT

response = kms_client.create_crypto_key(parent=parent, crypto_key_id='<key-id>', crypto_key={'purpose': purpose})
print(f'Created CMEK: {response.name}')
```

2. Next, you need to update the BigQuery table to use the newly created CMEK for encryption using the following code:

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path-to-service-account-key-file>')
bq_client = bigquery.Client(credentials=credentials, project='<project-id>')

dataset_ref = bq_client.dataset('<dataset-id>')
table_ref = dataset_ref.table('<table-id>')
table = bq_client.get_table(table_ref)

table.encryption_configuration = bigquery.EncryptionConfiguration(
    kms_key_name=f'projects/<project-id>/locations/<location>/keyRings/<key-ring>/cryptoKeys/<key-id>'
)

table = bq_client.update_table(table, ['encryption_configuration'])
print(f'Table {table.table_id} is now encrypted with CMEK')
```

Once you run the above two code snippets, the BigQuery table will be encrypted with the newly created CMEK.
