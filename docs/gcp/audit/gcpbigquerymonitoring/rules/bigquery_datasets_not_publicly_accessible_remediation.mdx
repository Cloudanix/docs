### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of BigQuery datasets being anonymously or publicly accessible in GCP Console, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and go to the BigQuery page.
2. Select the dataset that you want to remediate.
3. Click on the "Share dataset" button at the top of the page.
4. In the sharing panel, click on the "Advanced" button at the bottom.
5. In the "Access" section, check for any entries that have "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers" listed in the "Entity" field.
6. Remove any such entries by clicking on the "X" button next to them.
7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

By following the above steps, you will remediate the misconfiguration and ensure that the BigQuery datasets are not anonymously or publicly accessible.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of BigQuery datasets being anonymously or publicly accessible in GCP, you can follow these steps in the GCP CLI:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.
2. Run the following command to list all the BigQuery datasets in your project: 

```
bq ls --format=prettyjson
```

3. Identify the dataset(s) that are anonymously or publicly accessible by checking the "access" field in the output. If the "access" field includes "READER" or "WRITER" with "SpecialGroup:allAuthenticatedUsers" or "allUsers", then the dataset is publicly accessible.

4. Run the following command to remove the public access from the identified dataset(s):

```
bq update --default_table_expiration 0 --default_partition_expiration 0 --view_encryption_kms_key=projects/<project_id>/locations/<location>/keyRings/<keyring_name>/cryptoKeys/<cryptokey_name> <project_id>:<dataset_name>
```

Replace the `<project_id>` with your project ID, `<location>` with the location of your KMS keyring, `<keyring_name>` with the name of your KMS keyring, `<cryptokey_name>` with the name of your crypto key, and `<dataset_name>` with the name of the identified dataset.

5. After running the command, check the "access" field again using the command in step 2 to ensure that the public access has been removed.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of BigQuery datasets being anonymously or publicly accessible in GCP.

#### Using Python

To remediate this misconfiguration in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you can use the Google Cloud Client Library for Python. Here are the steps to remediate the issue:

1. Install the Google Cloud Client Library for Python by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   pip install google-cloud-bigquery
   ```

2. Authenticate your application to access your GCP project. You can follow the instructions in this link to set up authentication: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started

3. Use the following Python code to check if any of your BigQuery datasets are publicly or anonymously accessible:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import bigquery

   client = bigquery.Client()

   datasets = client.list_datasets()

   for dataset in datasets:
       if dataset.access_entries:
           for entry in dataset.access_entries:
               if entry.role == "READER" and (
                   entry.entity_type == "userByEmail"
                   and entry.entity_id == "allUsers"
               ):
                   print(f"{dataset.dataset_id} is publicly accessible.")
               elif entry.role == "READER" and (
                   entry.entity_type == "specialGroup"
                   and entry.entity_id == "allAuthenticatedUsers"
               ):
                   print(f"{dataset.dataset_id} is anonymously accessible.")
   ```

4. If the code above outputs any datasets that are publicly or anonymously accessible, you can use the following code to revoke the access:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import bigquery

   client = bigquery.Client()

   dataset_ref = client.dataset("my_dataset")
   dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_ref)

   access_entries = dataset.access_entries
   access_entries = [
       entry
       for entry in access_entries
       if not (
           entry.role == "READER"
           and (
               entry.entity_type == "userByEmail"
               and entry.entity_id == "allUsers"
           )
       )
   ]
   access_entries = [
       entry
       for entry in access_entries
       if not (
           entry.role == "READER"
           and (
               entry.entity_type == "specialGroup"
               and entry.entity_id == "allAuthenticatedUsers"
           )
       )
   ]

   dataset.access_entries = access_entries
   dataset = client.update_dataset(dataset, ["access_entries"])
   ```

   Replace `"my_dataset"` with the name of the dataset that you want to remediate.

5. Repeat step 4 for any other datasets that are publicly or anonymously accessible.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration where BigQuery datasets are publicly or anonymously accessible in GCP using Python.
