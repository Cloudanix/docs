### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to BigQuery: From the left-hand side menu, select "BigQuery" under the "Big Data" section. This will take you to the BigQuery interface.

3. Check Dataset Settings: Select a dataset from the resources panel on the left. Click on the name of the dataset, then click on "Dataset settings" from the context menu that appears.

4. Verify User Activity Logging: In the Dataset settings, look for the "Data access logs" section. If User Activity Logging is enabled, you should see "Cloud Audit Logs" listed here. If it's not listed, then User Activity Logging is not enabled for this dataset.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Once the CLI is set up, authenticate your Google Cloud account by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to log in with your Google Cloud account.

3. Set your project ID to the project you want to check for BigQuery user activity logging. Replace `your_project_id` with your actual project ID in the following command:
   ```
   gcloud config set project your_project_id
   ```

4. Run the following command to list all datasets in your project and check their settings:
   ```
   gcloud bigquery datasets list --format="table(datasetId, location, defaultTableExpirationMs, defaultPartitionExpirationMs)"
   ```
   This command will return a table with the dataset ID, location, default table expiration time, and default partition expiration time for each dataset in your project.

5. To check if user activity logging is enabled for a specific dataset, replace `your_dataset_id` with your actual dataset ID in the following command:
   ```
   gcloud logging read "logName=projects/your_project_id/datasets/your_dataset_id AND protoPayload.@type.type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.AuditLog"
   ```
   This command will return a list of audit logs for the specified dataset. If user activity logging is enabled, you should see logs with the type `google.cloud.audit.AuditLog`. If you don't see any logs of this type, user activity logging is not enabled for the dataset.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary libraries: Before you start, you need to install the Google Cloud Client Library for Python. You can do this using pip:

```python
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigquery
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and set up the client: You will need to import the BigQuery client from the Google Cloud library. You will also need to set up the client using your project ID.

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery

# Replace 'your-project-id' with your project's ID
client = bigquery.Client(project='your-project-id')
```

3. Query the BigQuery Data Access logs: You can use the BigQuery client to query the BigQuery Data Access logs. This will return a list of all the datasets in your project, along with information about whether user activity logging is enabled or not.

```python
datasets = list(client.list_datasets())
for dataset in datasets:
    dataset_ref = client.dataset(dataset.dataset_id)
    dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_ref)
    print("Dataset ID: {}".format(dataset.dataset_id))
    print("User Activity Logging Enabled: {}".format(dataset.access_entries))
```

4. Analyze the results: The script will print out the ID of each dataset and whether user activity logging is enabled or not. If user activity logging is not enabled for a dataset, this could be a potential misconfiguration. 

Note: The `access_entries` property of a dataset object returns a list of `AccessEntry` objects, each representing a user, group, or view that has access to the dataset. If user activity logging is enabled, this list should include an entry for 'allAuthenticatedUsers' or specific users with 'READER', 'WRITER', or 'OWNER' roles. If such an entry is not found, it means user activity logging is not enabled.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "GCP BigQuery Should Have User Activity Logging Enabled" for GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP console and navigate to the BigQuery service.

2. Click on the "Navigation Menu" icon on the top-left corner of the console.

3. From the menu, select "BigQuery".

4. In the BigQuery console, click on the "Settings" icon on the left-hand side panel.

5. Click on the "Audit logs" tab.

6. Under the "Audit logs" tab, click on the "Configure" button.

7. In the "Configure audit logs" window, select the checkbox next to "Data access".

8. Select the checkbox next to "Cloud audit logs".

9. Click on the "Save" button.

10. Once the configuration is saved, the user activity logging for BigQuery is enabled.

Note: It is recommended to create a log sink to export the logs to a centralized logging system for further analysis.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "GCP BigQuery Should Have User Activity Logging Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the command prompt or terminal on your local machine.

Step 2: Authenticate to your GCP account using the below command:

```
gcloud auth login
```

Step 3: Set the project to the project for which you want to enable user activity logging using the below command:

```
gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
```

Step 4: Enable the BigQuery API using the below command:

```
gcloud services enable bigquery.googleapis.com
```

Step 5: Enable user activity logging for BigQuery using the below command:

```
gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET_ID] --log-filter='protoPayload.methodName="google.cloud.bigquery.v2.JobService.InsertJob"'
```

Note: Replace [SINK_NAME], [PROJECT_ID], and [DATASET_ID] with your desired values.

Step 6: Verify that the user activity logging is enabled for BigQuery using the below command:

```
gcloud logging sinks describe [SINK_NAME]
```

This will display the details of the logging sink that you just created.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "GCP BigQuery Should Have User Activity Logging Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "GCP BigQuery Should Have User Activity Logging Enabled", you can follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP Console and navigate to the BigQuery service.
2. Click on the "Logs" tab in the left-hand menu.
3. Click on the "Audit Logs" tab.
4. Click on the "Create Sink" button.
5. Select the "BigQuery" destination.
6. Choose the project and dataset where you want to store the audit logs.
7. Click on the "Create Sink" button.
8. Open the Cloud Shell or terminal on your local machine and install the Google Cloud SDK.
9. Authenticate using your GCP account credentials by running the command `gcloud auth login`.
10. Set the project ID by running the command `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`.
11. Create a new Python file and import the necessary libraries:

```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2
from google.cloud.logging_v2 import enums
```

12. Initialize the Logging client:

```python
logging_client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
```

13. Define the BigQuery dataset ID and table ID where you want to store the audit logs:

```python
dataset_id = 'DATASET_ID'
table_id = 'TABLE_ID'
```

14. Define the Sink ID for the BigQuery sink:

```python
sink_name = f"projects/{project_id}/sinks/{sink_id}"
```

15. Create a new Sink object for the BigQuery sink:

```python
sink = logging_v2.LogSink(
    name=sink_name,
    destination=destination,
    filter_=filter_,
    output_version_format=enums.LogSink.VersionFormat.V2,
    bigquery_options=bigquery_options
)
```

16. Update the Sink configuration:

```python
update_mask = logging_v2.field_mask.FieldMask(
    paths=["destination", "filter", "bigquery_options"]
)

response = logging_client.update_sink(
    request={
        "sink_name": sink_name,
        "sink": sink,
        "update_mask": update_mask,
    }
)
```

17. Verify that the Sink configuration was updated successfully by checking the response:

```python
print(f"Sink updated: {response}")
```

18. Run the Python script to remediate the misconfiguration.

These steps will enable user activity logging for BigQuery on GCP and store the audit logs in a BigQuery dataset and table.
