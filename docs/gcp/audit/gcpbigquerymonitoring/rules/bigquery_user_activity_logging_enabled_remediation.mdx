### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the GCP BigQuery misconfiguration of not having user activity logging enabled, follow these steps:

1. Go to the GCP console and navigate to the BigQuery page.
2. Click on the name of the project that contains the BigQuery dataset that needs to be remediated.
3. In the left-hand menu, click on "Logging".
4. Click "Edit" to edit the logging settings.
5. Under "Activity", select "All activity data".
6. Click "Save" to save the changes.

Once these steps are completed, user activity logging will be enabled for the BigQuery dataset in the GCP project. It is important to note that it may take some time for the logging to take effect and for activity data to start being recorded.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of GCP BigQuery not having user activity logging enabled, follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP Cloud Shell
2. Run the following command to enable user activity logging for BigQuery in the desired project: 

   ```
   gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET] --log-filter='protoPayload.methodName="google.cloud.bigquery.v2.JobService.JobCompleted"'
   ```
   Replace `[SINK_NAME]` with a name of your choice for the sink, `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of the project where BigQuery is located, and `[DATASET]` with the name of the dataset where you want to store the logs.
   
3. Run the following command to grant the necessary permissions to the sink:

   ```
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member=serviceAccount:[SINK_SERVICE_ACCOUNT] --role=roles/bigquery.dataOwner
   ```
   Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of the project where BigQuery is located, and `[SINK_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]` with the email address of the service account associated with the sink.
   
4. Verify that the sink has been created by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud logging sinks list
   ```
   
   The sink you created should be listed.
   
5. Verify that the logs are being stored in BigQuery by running a query on the dataset you specified in the sink creation command. For example:

   ```
   SELECT *
   FROM `mydataset.cloudaudit_googleapis_com_activity_YYYYMMDD`
   ```
   
   Replace `mydataset` with the name of your dataset and `YYYYMMDD` with the date when the logs were generated. You should see a list of logs related to BigQuery user activity.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of GCP BigQuery not having user activity logging enabled using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.api_core.exceptions import NotFound
```

2. Set up the BigQuery client:
```python
client = bigquery.Client()
```

3. Check if user activity logging is enabled:
```python
dataset_id = 'your_dataset_id'
dataset_ref = client.dataset(dataset_id)

try:
    dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_ref)
    if not dataset.default_table_expiration_ms:
        raise NotFound("User activity logging is not enabled.")
    else:
        print("User activity logging is enabled.")
except NotFound as e:
    print(e)
```

4. If user activity logging is not enabled, enable it:
```python
dataset = bigquery.Dataset(dataset_ref)
dataset.default_table_expiration_ms = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365  # 1 year in milliseconds

dataset = client.update_dataset(dataset, ["default_table_expiration_ms"])
print("User activity logging has been enabled.")
```

Note: Replace `your_dataset_id` with the actual ID of the dataset you want to check or enable user activity logging for.

These steps will help you remediate the misconfiguration of GCP BigQuery not having user activity logging enabled using Python.
