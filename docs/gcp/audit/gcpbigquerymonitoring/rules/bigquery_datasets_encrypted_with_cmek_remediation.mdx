### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Login to Google Cloud Console: Open your Google Cloud Console and sign in with your GCP account credentials.

2. Navigate to BigQuery: From the left-hand side menu, navigate to "BigQuery" under the "Big Data" section.

3. Select Dataset: In the BigQuery dashboard, you will see a list of all your datasets. Select the dataset you want to check for CMEK configuration.

4. Check Encryption: Under the "Details" tab of the selected dataset, look for the "Encryption" section. If the "Default encryption" is set to "Google-managed key", then the default CMEK is not specified for the dataset. If it is set to "Customer-managed key", then the default CMEK is specified.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI if you haven't done so already. You can do this by following the instructions provided by Google Cloud at https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install.

2. Once the SDK is installed and configured, you can list all the datasets in your project by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   gcloud bigquery datasets list --format="value(datasetId)"
   ```

   This command will return a list of all dataset IDs in your current project.

3. For each dataset ID returned by the previous command, you can check the configuration of the dataset by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud bigquery datasets describe [DATASET_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[DATASET_ID]` with the ID of the dataset you want to check. This command will return a description of the dataset, including its configuration.

4. In the output of the previous command, look for the `defaultTableExpirationMs` and `defaultPartitionExpirationMs` fields. If these fields are not present or are set to `null`, then the dataset does not have a default CMEK specified.

#### Using Python

1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start writing the script, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. For this task, you will need the `google-cloud-bigquery` library. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install google-cloud-bigquery
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the BigQuery client: After installing the necessary libraries, you need to import them into your script and initialize the BigQuery client. 

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery

# Initialize a BigQuery client
client = bigquery.Client()
```

3. List all datasets and check for CMEK: Now, you can use the BigQuery client to list all datasets in your project and check if they have a default CMEK specified.

```python
datasets = list(client.list_datasets())  # Make an API request.

for dataset in datasets:
    dataset_ref = client.dataset(dataset.dataset_id)
    dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_ref)  # Make an API request.
    if not dataset.default_encryption_configuration:
        print(f"Dataset {dataset.dataset_id} does not have a default CMEK specified.")
    else:
        print(f"Dataset {dataset.dataset_id} has a default CMEK specified.")
```

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run the script to check if all datasets in your project have a default CMEK specified. If a dataset does not have a default CMEK, the script will print a message indicating this. If a dataset does have a default CMEK, the script will print a message indicating this. 

Note: Make sure to authenticate your script with GCP. You can do this by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key file.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Default CMEK Is Specified For BigQuery Data Sets" in GCP using GCP Console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the BigQuery console in the GCP Console.

2. In the navigation pane, select the dataset for which you want to set the default CMEK.

3. Click on the "Edit" button (pencil icon) next to the dataset name.

4. In the "Encryption" section, click on the "Change" button next to the "Default encryption" option.

5. In the "Default encryption" dialog box, select the checkbox "Use a customer-managed key (CMEK)".

6. Select the appropriate key from the dropdown list or create a new key.

7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

8. Repeat the above steps for all the datasets that need to be remediated.

By following the above steps, you can ensure that the default CMEK is specified for BigQuery datasets in GCP, and remediate the misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Default CMEK Is Specified For BigQuery Data Sets" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.

2. Run the following command to list all the BigQuery datasets in the project:

```
bq ls
```

3. Identify the dataset for which you want to set the default CMEK.

4. Run the following command to set the default CMEK for the identified dataset:

```
bq update --default_kms_key_id=<KMS_KEY_ID> <DATASET_NAME>
```

Replace `<KMS_KEY_ID>` with the ID of the KMS key that you want to use as the default CMEK for the dataset and `<DATASET_NAME>` with the name of the dataset that you identified in step 3.

5. Verify that the default CMEK has been set for the dataset by running the following command:

```
bq show <DATASET_NAME>
```

This will display the details of the dataset, including the default CMEK that has been set.

6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all the BigQuery datasets in the project to ensure that the default CMEK is specified for all the datasets.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Default CMEK Is Specified For BigQuery Data Sets" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Default CMEK Is Specified For BigQuery Data Sets" in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to create a Key Management Service (KMS) key ring and key in the same region as your BigQuery dataset.

```python
from google.cloud import kms_v1
from google.cloud.kms_v1 import enums

client = kms_v1.KeyManagementServiceClient()

# Set the parent location of the key ring
parent = client.location_path(project_id, location)

# Set the key ring ID and key ID
key_ring_id = 'my-key-ring'
key_id = 'my-key'

# Create the key ring
key_ring = client.create_key_ring(parent, key_ring_id, {})

# Create the key
key = client.create_crypto_key(key_ring.name, key_id, enums.CryptoKey.CryptoKeyPurpose.ENCRYPT_DECRYPT, {})
```

2. Next, you need to set the default encryption key for your BigQuery dataset using the KMS key you created in step 1.

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery

client = bigquery.Client()

# Set the dataset ID
dataset_id = 'my-dataset'

# Set the encryption configuration using the KMS key
encryption_config = bigquery.EncryptionConfiguration(
    kms_key_name=f"projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{key_ring_id}/cryptoKeys/{key_id}"
)

# Set the default encryption configuration for the dataset
dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_id)
dataset.encryption_configuration = encryption_config
client.update_dataset(dataset, ["encryption_configuration"])
```

3. Finally, you need to verify that the default encryption key is set for your BigQuery dataset.

```python
# Get the dataset and verify the encryption configuration
dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_id)
print(f"Encryption configuration: {dataset.encryption_configuration}")
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Default CMEK Is Specified For BigQuery Data Sets" in GCP using Python.
