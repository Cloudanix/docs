1. Login to Google Cloud Console: Open your Google Cloud Console and sign in with your GCP account credentials.

2. Navigate to BigQuery: From the left-hand side menu, navigate to the "BigQuery" service under the "Big Data" section.

3. Select Dataset: In the BigQuery dashboard, you will see a list of all your datasets. Select the dataset for which you want to check the CMEK configuration.

4. Check CMEK Configuration: Once you've selected the dataset, go to the "Details" tab. Here, you can see the "Default table expiration" and "Default partition expiration" settings. If the "Default encryption" is set to "Google-managed key", then the default CMEK is not specified for this dataset. If it's set to "Customer-managed key (CMEK)", then the default CMEK is specified.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI if you haven't done so already. You can do this by following the instructions provided by Google Cloud at https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install.

2. Once the SDK is installed and configured, open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the following command to list all the datasets in a specific project:

   ```
   gcloud bigquery datasets list --project=<project-id>
   ```
   Replace `<project-id>` with your actual project ID.

4. For each dataset listed, run the following command to check if the Default CMEK is specified:

   ```
   gcloud bigquery datasets describe <dataset-id> --project=<project-id> --format=json | grep kmsKeyName
   ```
   Replace `<dataset-id>` with the ID of the dataset you want to check, and `<project-id>` with your actual project ID. If the `kmsKeyName` field is empty or not present, then the Default CMEK is not specified for that dataset.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install the necessary Python libraries: Before you can start, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK and the Google Cloud Client Library for Python. You can do this using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-sdk
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigquery
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and set up authentication: In your Python script, you'll need to import the BigQuery client from the Google Cloud library. You'll also need to authenticate your script with your Google Cloud credentials.

   ```python
   from google.cloud import bigquery
   import os

   # Set your Google Cloud credentials
   os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "/path/to/your/credentials.json"
   ```

3. Create a function to check for CMEK: This function will use the BigQuery client to list all datasets in your project, then check each one to see if it has a default CMEK (Customer-Managed Encryption Key) specified.

   ```python
   def check_cmek():
       # Create a client
       client = bigquery.Client()

       # List all datasets in the project
       datasets = list(client.list_datasets())

       # Check each dataset for a default CMEK
       for dataset in datasets:
           dataset_ref = client.dataset(dataset.dataset_id)
           dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_ref)
           if not dataset.default_encryption_configuration:
               print(f"Dataset {dataset.dataset_id} does not have a default CMEK specified.")
           else:
               print(f"Dataset {dataset.dataset_id} has a default CMEK specified.")
   ```

4. Call the function: Finally, call the function in your script to check all datasets in your project.

   ```python
   check_cmek()
   ```

This script will print out a message for each dataset in your project, telling you whether or not it has a default CMEK specified.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Default CMEK Is Specified For BigQuery Data Sets" in GCP using GCP Console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the BigQuery console in the GCP Console.

2. In the navigation pane, select the dataset for which you want to set the default CMEK.

3. Click on the "Edit" button (pencil icon) next to the dataset name.

4. In the "Encryption" section, click on the "Change" button next to the "Default encryption" option.

5. In the "Default encryption" dialog box, select the checkbox "Use a customer-managed key (CMEK)".

6. Select the appropriate key from the dropdown list or create a new key.

7. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

8. Repeat the above steps for all the datasets that need to be remediated.

By following the above steps, you can ensure that the default CMEK is specified for BigQuery datasets in GCP, and remediate the misconfiguration.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Default CMEK Is Specified For BigQuery Data Sets" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.

2. Run the following command to list all the BigQuery datasets in the project:

```
bq ls
```

3. Identify the dataset for which you want to set the default CMEK.

4. Run the following command to set the default CMEK for the identified dataset:

```
bq update --default_kms_key_id=<KMS_KEY_ID> <DATASET_NAME>
```

Replace `<KMS_KEY_ID>` with the ID of the KMS key that you want to use as the default CMEK for the dataset and `<DATASET_NAME>` with the name of the dataset that you identified in step 3.

5. Verify that the default CMEK has been set for the dataset by running the following command:

```
bq show <DATASET_NAME>
```

This will display the details of the dataset, including the default CMEK that has been set.

6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all the BigQuery datasets in the project to ensure that the default CMEK is specified for all the datasets.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Default CMEK Is Specified For BigQuery Data Sets" for GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Default CMEK Is Specified For BigQuery Data Sets" in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to create a Key Management Service (KMS) key ring and key in the same region as your BigQuery dataset.

```python
from google.cloud import kms_v1
from google.cloud.kms_v1 import enums

client = kms_v1.KeyManagementServiceClient()

# Set the parent location of the key ring
parent = client.location_path(project_id, location)

# Set the key ring ID and key ID
key_ring_id = 'my-key-ring'
key_id = 'my-key'

# Create the key ring
key_ring = client.create_key_ring(parent, key_ring_id, {})

# Create the key
key = client.create_crypto_key(key_ring.name, key_id, enums.CryptoKey.CryptoKeyPurpose.ENCRYPT_DECRYPT, {})
```

2. Next, you need to set the default encryption key for your BigQuery dataset using the KMS key you created in step 1.

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery

client = bigquery.Client()

# Set the dataset ID
dataset_id = 'my-dataset'

# Set the encryption configuration using the KMS key
encryption_config = bigquery.EncryptionConfiguration(
    kms_key_name=f"projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{key_ring_id}/cryptoKeys/{key_id}"
)

# Set the default encryption configuration for the dataset
dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_id)
dataset.encryption_configuration = encryption_config
client.update_dataset(dataset, ["encryption_configuration"])
```

3. Finally, you need to verify that the default encryption key is set for your BigQuery dataset.

```python
# Get the dataset and verify the encryption configuration
dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_id)
print(f"Encryption configuration: {dataset.encryption_configuration}")
```

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Default CMEK Is Specified For BigQuery Data Sets" in GCP using Python.
