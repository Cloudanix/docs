### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Default CMEK Is Specified For BigQuery Data Sets" in GCP console, please follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP Console and navigate to the BigQuery page.

2. Select the dataset for which you want to specify the default CMEK.

3. Click on the "Edit" button to edit the dataset.

4. In the "Encryption" section, select the "Google-managed key" option.

5. Choose the key ring and the key that you want to use as the default CMEK.

6. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

7. Verify that the default CMEK is now specified for the dataset by checking the "Encryption" section.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Default CMEK Is Specified For BigQuery Data Sets" in GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Default CMEK Is Specified For BigQuery Data Sets" in GCP using CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP Console.
2. Run the following command to set the project ID where you want to remediate the misconfiguration:

   ```
   gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
   ```
   
   Replace `PROJECT_ID` with the ID of the project where you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

3. Run the following command to get the list of BigQuery datasets in your project:

   ```
   bq ls
   ```

4. For each dataset in the list, run the following command to check if the default CMEK is specified:

   ```
   bq show DATASET_ID | grep -i default_kms_key_name
   ```

   Replace `DATASET_ID` with the ID of the dataset you want to check.

   If the output of the above command is empty, then the default CMEK is not specified for the dataset.

5. Run the following command to set the default CMEK for the dataset:

   ```
   bq update --default_kms_key_name=projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/keyRings/KEY_RING/cryptoKeys/CRYPTO_KEY DATASET_ID
   ```

   Replace `PROJECT_ID`, `LOCATION`, `KEY_RING`, and `CRYPTO_KEY` with the appropriate values for your project and key, and replace `DATASET_ID` with the ID of the dataset you want to remediate.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for all the datasets in your project.

By following the above steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Ensure Default CMEK Is Specified For BigQuery Data Sets" in GCP using CLI.

#### Using Python

To ensure that Default CMEK is specified for BigQuery Data Sets in GCP, you can use the following Python code:

1. First, import the required libraries:

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.api_core.exceptions import NotFound
```

2. Next, set the project ID and the dataset ID:

```python
project_id = 'your-project-id'
dataset_id = 'your-dataset-id'
```

3. Then, create a BigQuery client object:

```python
client = bigquery.Client(project=project_id)
```

4. Check if the dataset exists:

```python
try:
    dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_id)
except NotFound:
    print(f"Dataset {dataset_id} does not exist in project {project_id}.")
    return
```

5. Set the default encryption configuration for the dataset:

```python
kms_key_name = 'projects/your-project-id/locations/your-location/keyRings/your-key-ring/cryptoKeys/your-key'
encryption_config = bigquery.EncryptionConfiguration(
    kms_key_name=kms_key_name
)
dataset.default_encryption_configuration = encryption_config

dataset = client.update_dataset(dataset, ['default_encryption_configuration'])
```

6. Finally, print a message indicating that the default encryption configuration has been set:

```python
print(f"Default encryption configuration has been set for dataset {dataset_id}.")
```

This code will ensure that Default CMEK is specified for BigQuery Data Sets in GCP.
