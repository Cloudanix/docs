<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "GCP BigQuery Should Have User Activity Logging Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Open the command prompt or terminal on your local machine.

Step 2: Authenticate to your GCP account using the below command:

```
gcloud auth login
```

Step 3: Set the project to the project for which you want to enable user activity logging using the below command:

```
gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
```

Step 4: Enable the BigQuery API using the below command:

```
gcloud services enable bigquery.googleapis.com
```

Step 5: Enable user activity logging for BigQuery using the below command:

```
gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET_ID] --log-filter='protoPayload.methodName="google.cloud.bigquery.v2.JobService.InsertJob"'
```

Note: Replace [SINK_NAME], [PROJECT_ID], and [DATASET_ID] with your desired values.

Step 6: Verify that the user activity logging is enabled for BigQuery using the below command:

```
gcloud logging sinks describe [SINK_NAME]
```

This will display the details of the logging sink that you just created.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "GCP BigQuery Should Have User Activity Logging Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "GCP BigQuery Should Have User Activity Logging Enabled", you can follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP Console and navigate to the BigQuery service.
2. Click on the "Logs" tab in the left-hand menu.
3. Click on the "Audit Logs" tab.
4. Click on the "Create Sink" button.
5. Select the "BigQuery" destination.
6. Choose the project and dataset where you want to store the audit logs.
7. Click on the "Create Sink" button.
8. Open the Cloud Shell or terminal on your local machine and install the Google Cloud SDK.
9. Authenticate using your GCP account credentials by running the command `gcloud auth login`.
10. Set the project ID by running the command `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`.
11. Create a new Python file and import the necessary libraries:

```python
from google.cloud import logging_v2
from google.cloud.logging_v2 import enums
```

12. Initialize the Logging client:

```python
logging_client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client()
```

13. Define the BigQuery dataset ID and table ID where you want to store the audit logs:

```python
dataset_id = 'DATASET_ID'
table_id = 'TABLE_ID'
```

14. Define the Sink ID for the BigQuery sink:

```python
sink_name = f"projects/{project_id}/sinks/{sink_id}"
```

15. Create a new Sink object for the BigQuery sink:

```python
sink = logging_v2.LogSink(
    name=sink_name,
    destination=destination,
    filter_=filter_,
    output_version_format=enums.LogSink.VersionFormat.V2,
    bigquery_options=bigquery_options
)
```

16. Update the Sink configuration:

```python
update_mask = logging_v2.field_mask.FieldMask(
    paths=["destination", "filter", "bigquery_options"]
)

response = logging_client.update_sink(
    request={
        "sink_name": sink_name,
        "sink": sink,
        "update_mask": update_mask,
    }
)
```

17. Verify that the Sink configuration was updated successfully by checking the response:

```python
print(f"Sink updated: {response}")
```

18. Run the Python script to remediate the misconfiguration.

These steps will enable user activity logging for BigQuery on GCP and store the audit logs in a BigQuery dataset and table.
