<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine and authenticate it. You can download the SDK from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. After installation, you can authenticate it using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. Set the project ID: You need to set the project ID for which you want to check the BigQuery tables. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```

3. List all datasets in the project: You can list all the datasets in the project using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud bigquery datasets list
   ```

4. Check the encryption configuration for each table: For each dataset, you need to list all the tables and check their encryption configuration. You can do this using the following commands:

   ```
   gcloud bigquery tables list --dataset-id [DATASET_ID]
   gcloud bigquery tables describe [TABLE_ID] --dataset-id [DATASET_ID]
   ```

   In the output of the describe command, look for the "encryptionConfiguration" field. If this field is not present or if it is set to "NONE", then the table is not encrypted.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google BigQuery: Before you start, make sure you have installed Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google BigQuery. You can install the Python client using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigquery
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the BigQuery client: You will need to import the google.cloud.bigquery library and initialize the BigQuery client. Replace 'your-project-id' with your actual project ID.

   ```python
   from google.cloud import bigquery
   client = bigquery.Client(project='your-project-id')
   ```

3. Fetch the dataset and table details: You can fetch the details of all the datasets and tables in your project using the list_datasets() and list_tables() methods. 

   ```python
   datasets = list(client.list_datasets())
   for dataset in datasets:
       tables = client.list_tables(dataset.dataset_id)
       for table in tables:
           print(f"Dataset ID: {dataset.dataset_id}, Table ID: {table.table_id}")
   ```

4. Check the encryption configuration: For each table, you can check the encryption configuration using the encryption_configuration property. If the kms_key_name property is None, it means the table is not encrypted using a Cloud KMS key.

   ```python
   for dataset in datasets:
       tables = client.list_tables(dataset.dataset_id)
       for table in tables:
           table_ref = client.dataset(dataset.dataset_id).table(table.table_id)
           table_obj = client.get_table(table_ref)
           if table_obj.encryption_configuration is None or table_obj.encryption_configuration.kms_key_name is None:
               print(f"Dataset ID: {dataset.dataset_id}, Table ID: {table.table_id} is not encrypted with a Cloud KMS key.")
   ```

This script will print out the IDs of all the datasets and tables that are not encrypted using a Cloud KMS key.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of GCP BigQuery Tables should be encrypted, you can follow the below steps using GCP console:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select your project.

2. In the navigation menu, select "BigQuery" under the "Big Data" section.

3. Select the dataset that contains the tables you want to encrypt.

4. Click on the "Encrypt" button in the top menu bar.

5. Select the "Customer-managed key" option.

6. Choose the key you want to use to encrypt the data.

7. Click on the "Encrypt" button to start the encryption process.

8. Wait for the encryption process to complete.

9. Once the encryption process is complete, all the tables in the selected dataset will be encrypted using the customer-managed key.

10. Verify that the tables are encrypted by checking the "Encryption" column in the table list. It should show "Customer-managed key".

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of GCP BigQuery Tables should be encrypted.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "GCP BigQuery Tables Should Be Encrypted" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell from the GCP console.
2. Run the following command to enable the Cloud KMS API:
```
gcloud services enable cloudkms.googleapis.com
```
3. Create a new keyring for BigQuery table encryption by running the following command:
```
gcloud kms keyrings create <KEYRING_NAME> --location <LOCATION>
```
Note: Replace `<KEYRING_NAME>` with a name of your choice and `<LOCATION>` with the location where you want to create the keyring.
4. Create a new key in the keyring by running the following command:
```
gcloud kms keys create <KEY_NAME> --keyring <KEYRING_NAME> --location <LOCATION> --purpose encryption
```
Note: Replace `<KEY_NAME>` with a name of your choice and `<KEYRING_NAME>` and `<LOCATION>` with the names you used in step 3.
5. Grant the BigQuery service account the necessary permissions to use the key by running the following command:
```
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding <KEY_NAME> --keyring <KEYRING_NAME> --location <LOCATION> --member serviceAccount:<BIGQUERY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL> --role roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter
```
Note: Replace `<KEY_NAME>`, `<KEYRING_NAME>`, `<LOCATION>`, and `<BIGQUERY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>` with the appropriate values.
6. Update the BigQuery table to use the new key for encryption by running the following command:
```
bq update --table --customer-managed-encryption <KEY_NAME> <DATASET_NAME>.<TABLE_NAME>
```
Note: Replace `<KEY_NAME>`, `<DATASET_NAME>`, and `<TABLE_NAME>` with the appropriate values.
7. Verify that the BigQuery table is now encrypted by running the following command:
```
bq show --format=prettyjson <DATASET_NAME>.<TABLE_NAME> | grep -i "encryption"
```
The output should show that the table is encrypted using the specified key.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "GCP BigQuery Tables Should Be Encrypted" for GCP using GCP CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "GCP BigQuery Tables Should Be Encrypted", you can use the following steps:

1. Install the Google Cloud SDK by following the instructions provided in the official documentation.

2. Once you have installed the Google Cloud SDK, authenticate with your GCP account by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. Create a Python script to encrypt all the tables in your BigQuery dataset. You can use the following code as a starting point:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import bigquery

   # Initialize the BigQuery client
   client = bigquery.Client()

   # Set the dataset ID
   dataset_id = 'your_dataset_id'

   # Get a list of all the tables in the dataset
   tables = client.list_tables(dataset_id)

   # Encrypt each table in the dataset
   for table in tables:
       table_ref = client.dataset(dataset_id).table(table.table_id)
       table = client.get_table(table_ref)
       table.encryption_configuration = bigquery.EncryptionConfiguration(
           kms_key_name='projects/your_project_id/locations/your_location/keyRings/your_key_ring/cryptoKeys/your_crypto_key'
       )
       client.update_table(table, ['encryption_configuration'])
   ```

   Replace the `your_dataset_id`, `your_project_id`, `your_location`, `your_key_ring`, and `your_crypto_key` placeholders with the actual values.

4. Save the Python script and run it using the following command:

   ```
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

   This will encrypt all the tables in your BigQuery dataset using the specified KMS key.

5. Verify that the tables have been encrypted by running the following command:

   ```
   bq show --format=prettyjson your_dataset_id.your_table_id
   ```

   This will display the table metadata, including the encryption configuration.
