1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, visit the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in with your GCP account credentials.

2. Navigate to BigQuery: From the GCP Console dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines) located at the top left corner of the console, scroll down and click on "BigQuery" under the "Big Data" section.

3. Select the Dataset: In the BigQuery dashboard, you will see a list of all your datasets on the left-hand side. Click on the dataset that contains the table you want to check.

4. Check Table Details: After selecting the dataset, a list of tables within that dataset will appear. Click on the table you want to check. This will open the table details page. Here, under the "Details" tab, look for the "Options" section. If the "Ignore unknown values" option is not enabled, it means that the BigQuery table is not configured to ignore unknown values.

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
1. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. Authenticate your GCP account using the following command. This will open a new window in your web browser asking you to log in to your Google Cloud account.
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. Set your GCP project ID to the project you want to check. Replace 'your-project-id' with your actual project ID.
   ```
   gcloud config set project your-project-id
   ```

4. Run the following command to list all BigQuery datasets in your project.
   ```
   gcloud bigquery datasets list
   ```

5. For each dataset, list all tables and check if 'ignoreUnknownValues' is set to true. Replace 'your-dataset-id' with your actual dataset ID.
   ```
   gcloud bigquery tables describe your-dataset-id
   ```
   This will output a JSON object with the table's configuration. Look for the 'ignoreUnknownValues' field. If it's set to false or not present, then the table is not configured to ignore unknown values.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for BigQuery: Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and the Python client for BigQuery. You can install the Python client with pip:

   ```bash
   pip install google-cloud-bigquery
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the BigQuery client: In your Python script, you'll need to import the BigQuery client from the Google Cloud library. Then, initialize the client with your project ID.

   ```python
   from google.cloud import bigquery
   client = bigquery.Client(project='my-project-id')
   ```

3. Fetch the list of all datasets and tables: You can fetch all datasets in your project and then iterate over each dataset to fetch all tables.

   ```python
   datasets = list(client.list_datasets())
   for dataset in datasets:
       tables = client.list_tables(dataset.dataset_id)
       for table in tables:
           print(table.table_id)
   ```

4. Check the 'ignore_unknown_values' setting: For each table, fetch the table details and check the 'ignore_unknown_values' setting. If it's set to False, then it's a misconfiguration.

   ```python
   for dataset in datasets:
       tables = client.list_tables(dataset.dataset_id)
       for table in tables:
           table_ref = client.dataset(dataset.dataset_id).table(table.table_id)
           table_obj = client.get_table(table_ref)  # API Request
           if not table_obj.schema:
               print(f"Table {table.table_id} has no schema.")
           else:
               if not table_obj.ignore_unknown_values:
                   print(f"Table {table.table_id} does not ignore unknown values.")
   ```

This script will print out the names of all tables that do not have 'ignore_unknown_values' enabled.

### Remediation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Using Console' defaultOpen='true'>
To remediate the misconfiguration of GCP BigQuery Tables not enabling Ignore Unknown Values, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the GCP Console and navigate to the BigQuery section.
2. Select the dataset that contains the table for which you want to enable Ignore Unknown Values.
3. Click on the table name to open the table details.
4. Click on the Edit schema button to edit the schema of the table.
5. In the Edit schema window, scroll down to the Advanced section.
6. Toggle on the Ignore Unknown Values option.
7. Click on the Save button to save the changes.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of GCP BigQuery Tables not enabling Ignore Unknown Values.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the GCP BigQuery Tables Should Enable Ignore Unknown Values misconfiguration, you can follow these steps using GCP CLI:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in your GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to enable the Ignore Unknown Values option for all tables in your BigQuery dataset:

```
bq update --all --schema_update_option=ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION <project_id>:<dataset_name>
```

Replace `<project_id>` with your GCP project ID and `<dataset_name>` with the name of the BigQuery dataset that you want to update.

3. Once the command is executed, it will update all the tables in the specified dataset to enable the Ignore Unknown Values option. This means that any new fields added to the data will be ignored instead of causing an error.

4. Verify the changes by running the following command:

```
bq show <project_id>:<dataset_name>.<table_name>
```

Replace `<table_name>` with the name of the BigQuery table that you want to verify. The output should show that the Ignore Unknown Values option is enabled.

By following these steps, you have successfully remediated the GCP BigQuery Tables Should Enable Ignore Unknown Values misconfiguration using GCP CLI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration in GCP BigQuery Tables by enabling Ignore Unknown Values, you can follow these steps using Python:

1. Import the required libraries:

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.api_core.exceptions import BadRequest
```

2. Initialize the BigQuery client:

```python
client = bigquery.Client()
```

3. Define the dataset and table name:

```python
dataset_id = 'your_dataset_id'
table_id = 'your_table_id'
```

4. Get the table metadata:

```python
table_ref = client.dataset(dataset_id).table(table_id)
table = client.get_table(table_ref)
```

5. Update the table schema to enable Ignore Unknown Values:

```python
try:
    table.schema.update(
        bigquery.SchemaField('your_field_name', 'STRING', mode='NULLABLE', allow_unknown=True)
    )
    table = client.update_table(table, ['schema'])
    print(f'Table {table_id} schema updated.')
except BadRequest as e:
    print(f'Error updating table schema: {e}')
```

6. Verify that the Ignore Unknown Values setting is enabled:

```python
if table.schema[0].allow_unknown:
    print('Ignore Unknown Values is enabled.')
else:
    print('Ignore Unknown Values is not enabled.')
```

Note: Make sure to replace 'your_dataset_id', 'your_table_id', and 'your_field_name' with your own values. Also, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to update the table schema.
