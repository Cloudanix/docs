<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Spanner Database Backups Should Be Enabled" in GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.

2. Run the following command to enable backups for the Spanner database:

   ```
   gcloud spanner databases update [DATABASE_ID] --backup-config enable-point-in-time-recovery
   ```

   Replace `[DATABASE_ID]` with the ID of the Spanner database that needs to have backups enabled.

3. Verify that the backups have been enabled by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud spanner databases describe [DATABASE_ID] --format="value(backupInfo.enableTime)"
   ```

   If the output displays a timestamp, it means that backups have been enabled for the database.

4. Repeat the above steps for all the Spanner databases in your GCP project.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Spanner Database Backups Should Be Enabled" in GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the misconfiguration "Spanner Database Backups Should Be Enabled" for GCP using Python, you can use the following steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
from google.cloud import spanner
from google.api_core.exceptions import NotFound
```

2. Set up the Spanner client:

```python
client = spanner.Client()
```

3. Iterate through all the instances and databases in the project:

```python
for instance in client.list_instances():
    for database in instance.list_databases():
```

4. Check if the backup configuration is set for the database:

```python
try:
    backup_config = database.get_backup_config()
except NotFound:
    backup_config = None
```

5. If the backup configuration is not set, enable it:

```python
if not backup_config:
    backup_config = spanner.BackupConfig(
        enabled=True,
        backup_retention_days=7,
        transaction_log_retention_days=2
    )
    database.update_backup_config(backup_config)
```

6. Print the status of the backup configuration:

```python
if backup_config.enabled:
    print(f"Backup is enabled for database {database.database_id}.")
else:
    print(f"Backup is not enabled for database {database.database_id}.")
```

Putting it all together, the full Python code to remediate the misconfiguration "Spanner Database Backups Should Be Enabled" for GCP would look like this:

```python
from google.cloud import spanner
from google.api_core.exceptions import NotFound

client = spanner.Client()

for instance in client.list_instances():
    for database in instance.list_databases():
        try:
            backup_config = database.get_backup_config()
        except NotFound:
            backup_config = None

        if not backup_config:
            backup_config = spanner.BackupConfig(
                enabled=True,
                backup_retention_days=7,
                transaction_log_retention_days=2
            )
            database.update_backup_config(backup_config)

        if backup_config.enabled:
            print(f"Backup is enabled for database {database.database_id}.")
        else:
            print(f"Backup is not enabled for database {database.database_id}.")
```

This script will enable backups for all Cloud Spanner databases in your GCP project. You can run it periodically to ensure that backups remain enabled.
