### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to Spanner Instances: From the left-hand side menu, select "Spanner" under the "Storage" section. This will take you to the "Spanner Instances" page where you can see all your Spanner instances.

3. Select the Spanner Instance: Click on the name of the Spanner instance for which you want to check the backup encryption. This will take you to the "Instance details" page.

4. Check Backup Encryption: On the "Instance details" page, navigate to the "Backups" tab. Here, you can see the details of all the backups for the selected Spanner instance. Check the "Encryption" column for each backup. If the value is "Google-managed key", then the backup encryption is enabled. If the value is "Customer-managed key" and there is a key associated, then the backup encryption is also enabled. If there is no value or the value is "Customer-managed key" without an associated key, then the backup encryption is not enabled.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine and authenticate it with your Google Cloud account.

2. List all the instances in Spanner: Use the following command to list all the instances in Spanner.

   ```
   gcloud spanner instances list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all Spanner instances along with their details.

3. List all the backups in each instance: For each instance, use the following command to list all the backups.

   ```
   gcloud spanner backups list --instance=[INSTANCE_ID]
   ```

   Replace [INSTANCE_ID] with the ID of the instance. This command will return a list of all backups in the specified instance.

4. Check the encryption status of each backup: For each backup, use the following command to check its encryption status.

   ```
   gcloud spanner backups describe [BACKUP_ID] --instance=[INSTANCE_ID]
   ```

   Replace [BACKUP_ID] with the ID of the backup and [INSTANCE_ID] with the ID of the instance. This command will return the details of the specified backup, including its encryption status. If the encryption status is not "Google managed", then the backup is not encrypted.

#### Using Python

1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud Spanner: Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and authenticated it with your Google Cloud account. Also, install the Python Client for Google Cloud Spanner using pip:

   ```
   pip install google-cloud-spanner
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and set up the Spanner client: You will need to import the `google.cloud.spanner` library and set up a Spanner client with your project ID.

   ```python
   from google.cloud import spanner

   def create_client(project_id):
       return spanner.Client(project=project_id)
   ```

3. List all databases and check their backup encryption status: You can list all databases in your Spanner instance and check their backup encryption status using the `database.list_backups()` method. If the `encryption_config` attribute of a backup is `None`, it means that the backup is not encrypted.

   ```python
   def check_backup_encryption(client, instance_id):
       instance = client.instance(instance_id)
       for database in instance.list_databases():
           for backup in database.list_backups():
               if backup.encryption_config is None:
                   print(f"Backup {backup.name} of database {database.name} is not encrypted.")
   ```

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run the script by calling the `check_backup_encryption()` function with your project ID and Spanner instance ID.

   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       project_id = "your-project-id"
       instance_id = "your-instance-id"
       client = create_client(project_id)
       check_backup_encryption(client, instance_id)
   ```

This script will print the names of all backups that are not encrypted. If no such backups are found, it means that all your Spanner database backups are encrypted.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Spanner Database Backup Encryption Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Login to the Google Cloud Console.
2. Navigate to the Spanner database instance for which you want to enable the backup encryption.
3. Click on the "Edit" button on the top of the page.
4. Scroll down to the "Backup" section and click on it.
5. In the "Backup Encryption" section, select the "Enabled" option.
6. Choose a key version to encrypt the backups. You can either use a customer-managed encryption key or Google-managed encryption key.
7. If you choose a customer-managed encryption key, select the key from the dropdown list. If you choose Google-managed encryption key, then select the key version from the dropdown list.
8. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

Once you have enabled the backup encryption for the Spanner database instance, all the backups taken for that instance will be encrypted using the selected encryption key.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Spanner Database Backup Encryption Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.

2. Run the following command to enable backup encryption for the Spanner database:

   ```
   gcloud spanner databases update [DATABASE_ID] --backup-encryption-config kms-key-name=[KMS_KEY_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[DATABASE_ID]` with the ID of the Spanner database and `[KMS_KEY_NAME]` with the name of the KMS key used to encrypt the backups.

   For example:

   ```
   gcloud spanner databases update my-database --backup-encryption-config kms-key-name=my-key
   ```

3. Verify that backup encryption is enabled by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud spanner databases describe [DATABASE_ID] --format="value(backupConfig.encryptionConfig.kmsKeyName)"
   ```

   Replace `[DATABASE_ID]` with the ID of the Spanner database.

   The output should show the name of the KMS key used to encrypt the backups.

   For example:

   ```
   gcloud spanner databases describe my-database --format="value(backupConfig.encryptionConfig.kmsKeyName)"
   ```

4. Repeat steps 2-3 for each Spanner database in your GCP project.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration "Spanner Database Backup Encryption Should Be Enabled" for GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Spanner Database Backup Encryption Should Be Enabled" in GCP, we need to enable backup encryption for Spanner Database. Here are the steps to remediate this misconfiguration using Python:

1. Install the required libraries:

```python
!pip install google-cloud-spanner
```

2. Set up the authentication credentials for the GCP project:

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/service_account.json')
```

3. Import the required libraries:

```python
from google.cloud import spanner_v1
from google.cloud.spanner_v1 import Backup
from google.cloud.spanner_v1 import BackupEncryptionConfig
```

4. Initialize the Spanner client:

```python
spanner_client = spanner_v1.Client(credentials=credentials)
```

5. Get the instance and database IDs:

```python
instance_id = 'your-instance-id'
database_id = 'your-database-id'
```

6. Get the backup configuration:

```python
instance = spanner_client.instance(instance_id)
database = instance.database(database_id)
backup_config = database.backup_config
```

7. Check if backup encryption is enabled:

```python
if backup_config.encryption_config.encryption_type == BackupEncryptionConfig.EncryptionType.GOOGLE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION:
    print('Backup encryption is already enabled.')
else:
    print('Backup encryption is not enabled.')
```

8. If backup encryption is not enabled, enable it:

```python
backup_config.encryption_config.encryption_type = BackupEncryptionConfig.EncryptionType.GOOGLE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION
database.update_backup_config(backup_config)
print('Backup encryption has been enabled.')
```

9. Verify that backup encryption is enabled:

```python
backup_config = database.backup_config
if backup_config.encryption_config.encryption_type == BackupEncryptionConfig.EncryptionType.GOOGLE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION:
    print('Backup encryption is enabled.')
else:
    print('Backup encryption is not enabled.')
```

These steps will enable backup encryption for the Spanner database in GCP.
