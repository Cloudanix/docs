### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, visit the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console, and sign in with your Google account that has the necessary permissions to view Spanner database configurations.

2. Navigate to Spanner Databases: From the GCP Console dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner). Scroll down and click on "Spanner" under the "Storage" section. This will take you to the Spanner databases page.

3. Select the Database: On the Spanner databases page, you will see a list of all your Spanner databases. Click on the name of the database you want to check for encryption.

4. Check Encryption Status: Once you've selected a database, you will be taken to its details page. Here, look for the "Encryption" section. If the database is encrypted, it will show "Google-managed key" or "Customer-managed key" depending on the type of key used for encryption. If it shows "None", then the database is not encrypted.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. This will provide you with the necessary command-line tools to interact with resources hosted on Google Cloud Platform.

2. Use the following command to list all the Spanner instances in your GCP project:

   ```
   gcloud spanner instances list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all Spanner instances, including their instance ID, display name, configuration, and state.

3. For each Spanner instance, list all the databases using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud spanner databases list --instance=[INSTANCE_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[INSTANCE_ID]` with the ID of the Spanner instance. This command will return a list of all databases in the specified Spanner instance.

4. For each database, check the encryption configuration using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud spanner databases describe [DATABASE_ID] --instance=[INSTANCE_ID]
   ```

   Replace `[DATABASE_ID]` with the ID of the database and `[INSTANCE_ID]` with the ID of the Spanner instance. This command will return detailed information about the specified database, including its encryption configuration. If the database is encrypted, the `encryptionConfig` field will be present in the output. If this field is not present, the database is not encrypted.

#### Using Python

1. Install Google Cloud SDK and Python Client for Google Cloud Spanner: Before you start, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and authenticated it with your Google Cloud account. Also, install the Python Client for Google Cloud Spanner using pip:

   ```
   pip install google-cloud-spanner
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries and set up the Spanner client: You will need to import the `google.cloud.spanner` library and create a Spanner client using your project ID.

   ```python
   from google.cloud import spanner

   def create_client(project_id):
       return spanner.Client(project=project_id)
   ```

3. List all Spanner databases and check their encryption status: You can list all Spanner databases in your project and check their encryption status using the `instance.list_databases()` method. If the `encryption_config` attribute of a database is `None`, it means the database is not encrypted.

   ```python
   def check_encryption(client):
       for instance in client.list_instances():
           for database in instance.list_databases():
               if database.encryption_config is None:
                   print(f"Database {database.name} is not encrypted.")
   ```

4. Run the script: Finally, you can run the script by calling the `check_encryption` function with your project ID.

   ```python
   project_id = "your-project-id"  # replace with your project ID
   client = create_client(project_id)
   check_encryption(client)
   ```

This script will print the names of all Spanner databases in your project that are not encrypted.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of unencrypted Spanner databases on GCP, follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP Console and go to the Spanner instance that needs to be remediated.

2. Click on the Spanner instance to open its details page.

3. Click on the "Databases" tab to view the list of databases in the Spanner instance.

4. Select the database that needs to be encrypted and click on its name to open its details page.

5. Click on the "Encryption" tab to view the encryption settings for the database.

6. If the encryption is not enabled, click on the "Edit" button to enable it.

7. In the "Edit database" dialog box, select the checkbox for "Encrypt this database".

8. Choose the "Customer-managed encryption key" option and select the key that you want to use for encryption.

9. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

10. Verify that the encryption is enabled by checking the "Encryption" tab again.

11. Repeat the above steps for all the unencrypted Spanner databases in the instance.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration of unencrypted Spanner databases on GCP using the GCP Console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate this misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project where the Spanner database is located.
2. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon at the top right corner of the console.
3. Run the following command to enable the Cloud KMS API:

```
gcloud services enable cloudkms.googleapis.com
```

4. Create a new keyring for the Spanner database encryption by running the following command:

```
gcloud kms keyrings create <keyring-name> --location global
```

Replace `<keyring-name>` with a name of your choice.

5. Create a new key for the Spanner database encryption by running the following command:

```
gcloud kms keys create <key-name> --keyring <keyring-name> --location global --purpose encryption
```

Replace `<key-name>` with a name of your choice and `<keyring-name>` with the name of the keyring created in the previous step.

6. Grant the Cloud Spanner service account access to use the key by running the following command:

```
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding <key-name> --keyring <keyring-name> --location global --member serviceAccount:<service-account-email> --role roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter
```

Replace `<key-name>` with the name of the key created in step 5 and `<keyring-name>` with the name of the keyring created in step 4. Also, replace `<service-account-email>` with the email address of the Cloud Spanner service account.

7. Encrypt the Spanner database by running the following command:

```
gcloud spanner databases set-iam-policy <database-id> --member serviceAccount:<service-account-email> --role roles/spanner.databaseEncrypterDecrypter
```

Replace `<database-id>` with the ID of the Spanner database and `<service-account-email>` with the email address of the Cloud Spanner service account.

8. Verify that the Spanner database is encrypted by running the following command:

```
gcloud spanner databases describe <database-id> --format="value(encryptionConfig.kmsKeyName)"
```

Replace `<database-id>` with the ID of the Spanner database.

If the command returns the KMS key name, then the database is encrypted. If it returns an empty string, then the database is not encrypted.

By following these steps, you can remediate the misconfiguration and encrypt the Spanner database in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Spanner Databases Should Be Encrypted" for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Spanner Databases page.

2. Select the database that you want to encrypt.

3. Click on the "Encryption" tab.

4. Click on the "Edit" button.

5. Select the "Customer-managed key" option.

6. Choose the key that you want to use for encryption.

7. Click on the "Save" button.

8. Now, open the Cloud Shell in your GCP project.

9. Run the following command to install the Google Cloud Client Library for Python:

```
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-spanner
```

10. Run the following Python code to enable encryption for the selected database:

```
from google.cloud import spanner_v1

client = spanner_v1.SpannerClient()

instance_id = 'your-instance-id'
database_id = 'your-database-id'
key_name = 'projects/your-project-id/locations/your-key-location/keyRings/your-key-ring/cryptoKeys/your-key-name'

database = client.database_path(instance_id, database_id)
encryption_config = {'kms_key_name': key_name}

operation = client.update_database_ddl(database, ['ALTER DATABASE SET ENCRYPTION = %s' % (encryption_config,)])
print('Waiting for operation to complete...')
operation.result()
print('Database encrypted.')
```

Note: Replace the `instance_id`, `database_id`, `key_name`, and `your-project-id/your-key-location/your-key-ring/your-key-name` with your respective values.

11. Once the code is executed successfully, the selected Spanner database will be encrypted with the specified customer-managed key.

I hope this helps!
