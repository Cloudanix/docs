### More Info:

Determines if TCP port 5500 for VNC Client is open to the public. While some ports such as HTTP and HTTPS are required to be open to the public to function properly, more sensitive services such as VNC Client should be restricted to known IP addresses.

### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your preferred web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform web console and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to VPC Network: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner). Scroll down and click on "VPC Network" under the "Networking" section.

3. Check Firewall Rules: In the VPC Network page, click on "Firewall" to view all the firewall rules. Look for any rules that have "tcp:5900-5903" (the default VNC ports) in the "Protocols / ports" column. 

4. Review Source IP Ranges: For any rules that have the VNC ports open, check the "Source IP ranges" column. If it's set to "0.0.0.0/0", this means that the VNC client port is open to the entire internet, which is a misconfiguration.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate the Google Cloud SDK: The Google Cloud SDK includes the gcloud command-line tool, which you can use to manage your Google Cloud resources. You can download and install the SDK on your local machine and then authenticate it with your Google Cloud account.

   ```
   curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
   exec -l $SHELL
   gcloud init
   ```

2. List all the firewall rules: Use the following command to list all the firewall rules in your Google Cloud project. This will return a list of all the firewall rules, including their names, network, direction, priority, source ranges, allowed protocols and ports, and other details.

   ```
   gcloud compute firewall-rules list
   ```

3. Filter the firewall rules: You can filter the list of firewall rules to only include those that allow traffic on the VNC client port (5900). Use the following command to do this:

   ```
   gcloud compute firewall-rules list --filter="allowed:tcp:5900"
   ```

4. Review the filtered list: Review the filtered list of firewall rules. If any rules appear in the list, this means that the VNC client port is open in the network. If no rules appear in the list, this means that the VNC client port is not open.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "VNC Client Port Should Not Be Open" in GCP using GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the GCP console with your credentials.
2. Navigate to the Compute Engine section from the left-hand side menu.
3. Click on the name of the instance where you want to remediate the misconfiguration.
4. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
5. Scroll down to the "Firewall" section.
6. Click on the "default-allow-rdp" rule.
7. Click on the "Edit" button.
8. In the "Protocols and ports" section, uncheck the "tcp:3389" checkbox.
9. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.
10. Repeat steps 6-9 for "default-allow-vnc" rule.
11. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page to save the changes.

After following the above steps, the VNC Client Port will be closed and the misconfiguration will be remediated.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the VNC Client Port Should Not Be Open misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking the Activate Cloud Shell button in the GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to list all the firewall rules in your project:

   ```
   gcloud compute firewall-rules list
   ```

3. Identify the firewall rule that allows traffic to the VNC client port (usually port 5900).

4. Run the following command to delete the firewall rule:

   ```
   gcloud compute firewall-rules delete [FIREWALL_RULE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[FIREWALL_RULE_NAME]` with the name of the firewall rule that allows traffic to the VNC client port.

5. Verify that the firewall rule has been deleted by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute firewall-rules list
   ```

   The output should not include the firewall rule that allowed traffic to the VNC client port.

6. You have successfully remediated the VNC Client Port Should Not Be Open misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the VNC Client Port open misconfiguration in GCP using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. First, you need to authenticate and authorize your Google Cloud account using the Python client library. You can do this by following the instructions in the official Google Cloud documentation.

2. Next, you need to identify the GCP project and the specific instance(s) that have the VNC client port open. You can use the `google-cloud-sdk` command-line tool or the Python client library to list all the instances in your project.

3. Once you have identified the instances with the VNC client port open, you can use the Python client library to update the firewall rules for each instance to block the VNC client port. Here's an example code snippet that uses the `google-cloud-firewall` library to update the firewall rules for an instance:

```
from google.cloud import firewall

# Replace PROJECT_ID with your GCP project ID
project_id = 'PROJECT_ID'

# Replace INSTANCE_NAME with the name of the instance with the VNC client port open
instance_name = 'INSTANCE_NAME'

# Replace VNC_CLIENT_PORT with the actual port number (usually 5900)
vnc_client_port = 5900

# Create a firewall client object
firewall_client = firewall.FirewallClient()

# Get the firewall rules for the instance
firewall_rules = firewall_client.list(project=project_id)

# Find the rule that allows traffic to the VNC client port
vnc_client_rule = None
for rule in firewall_rules:
    if rule.allowed[0].ports == [str(vnc_client_port)] and \
            rule.direction == 'INGRESS' and \
            rule.target_tags == [instance_name]:
        vnc_client_rule = rule
        break

# If the rule exists, update it to block traffic to the VNC client port
if vnc_client_rule:
    vnc_client_rule.allowed = []
    firewall_client.update(vnc_client_rule)
```

4. Finally, you can verify that the VNC client port is no longer open by trying to connect to it from a remote machine. If the remediation was successful, the connection should be refused.
