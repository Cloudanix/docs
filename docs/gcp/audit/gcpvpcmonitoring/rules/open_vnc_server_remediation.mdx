### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account.

2. Navigate to VPC Network: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner), scroll down and click on "VPC Network" under the "Networking" section.

3. Check Firewall Rules: In the VPC Network page, click on "Firewall rules" in the left-hand menu. This will display a list of all the firewall rules in your network.

4. Inspect Open Ports: Look for any rules that have "tcp:5900-5903" (the range of ports used by VNC) in the "Protocols / ports" column and "Allow" in the "Action" column. If such a rule exists, it means that the VNC server port is open in your network.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate the Google Cloud SDK: The Google Cloud SDK includes the gcloud command-line tool, which is necessary to interact with your GCP resources. You can install it by following the instructions provided by Google Cloud. After installation, authenticate the SDK using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. List all the firewall rules: Use the following command to list all the firewall rules in your GCP project. This will display a list of all firewall rules, including their associated network, source range, allowed protocols and ports, and other information.

    ```
    gcloud compute firewall-rules list
    ```

3. Filter the firewall rules: To check if the VNC Server Port (usually port 5900) is open, you can filter the output of the previous command. Look for rules that allow traffic on port 5900. You can do this manually or use a command like the following:

    ```
    gcloud compute firewall-rules list --format="table(name, network, direction, priority, sourceRanges.list(), allowed[].map().firewall_rule().list(), targetTags.list())" | grep '5900'
    ```

4. Analyze the output: If the command returns any rules, it means that the VNC Server Port is open. The output will provide details about the rule, including the network it applies to, the direction of the traffic it allows, its priority, the source ranges it applies to, the allowed protocols and ports, and the target tags it applies to.

#### Using Python

1. Import the necessary libraries: You will need the 'socket' library to create a socket object and connect to the server, and the 'os' library to interact with the operating system.

```python
import socket
import os
```

2. Define the target and port: You need to specify the IP address of the target server and the port number of the VNC server (default is 5900).

```python
target = "IP_ADDRESS_OF_TARGET"
port = 5900
```

3. Create a socket object and connect to the server: Use the 'socket' library to create a socket object and then use the 'connect' method to try to connect to the server on the specified port.

```python
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.settimeout(5)
try:
    s.connect((target, port))
    print("VNC Server port is open")
except:
    print("VNC Server port is not open")
finally:
    s.close()
```

4. Run the script: Save the script and run it using the Python interpreter. If the VNC server port is open, it will print "VNC Server port is open". If it is not open, it will print "VNC Server port is not open".

Please replace "IP_ADDRESS_OF_TARGET" with the actual IP address of the target server. This script only checks if the port is open, it does not check if a VNC server is actually running on that port. For that, you would need a more complex script that sends a VNC handshake and checks the response.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration of VNC Server Port being open in GCP using the GCP console, follow the below steps:

1. Login to the GCP Console.

2. Navigate to the Compute Engine section.

3. Select the VM instance that has the open VNC server port.

4. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.

5. Scroll down to the "Firewall" section.

6. In the "Firewall" section, uncheck the "Allow HTTP traffic" and "Allow HTTPS traffic" options.

7. Scroll down to the "Cloud API access scopes" section.

8. In the "Cloud API access scopes" section, uncheck the "Allow default access" option.

9. Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes.

10. Verify that the VNC server port is no longer open by running a port scan on the VM instance.

11. If the VNC server port is still open, repeat the above steps and check for any misconfiguration or errors.

By following these steps, the misconfiguration of the VNC server port being open in GCP using the GCP console can be remediated.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration of having the VNC server port open on a GCP instance, you can follow the below steps using GCP CLI:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console.
2. Identify the instance that has the VNC server port open. You can use the following command to list all instances in your project:

   ```
   gcloud compute instances list
   ```

3. Once you have identified the instance, connect to it using SSH. You can use the following command to connect to the instance:

   ```
   gcloud compute ssh [INSTANCE_NAME]
   ```

4. Once you are connected to the instance, you need to find the VNC server process ID. You can use the following command to find the process ID:

   ```
   ps -ef | grep Xtightvnc
   ```

5. Once you have found the process ID, you can use the following command to kill the process:

   ```
   sudo kill [PROCESS_ID]
   ```

6. Next, you need to disable the VNC server from starting automatically on boot. You can use the following command to remove the VNC server startup script:

   ```
   sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/vncserver@.service
   ```

7. Finally, you need to ensure that the VNC server port is closed in the firewall. You can use the following command to remove the firewall rule that allows access to the VNC server port:

   ```
   gcloud compute firewall-rules delete [FIREWALL_RULE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace [FIREWALL_RULE_NAME] with the name of the firewall rule that allows access to the VNC server port.

After completing these steps, you will have successfully remediated the misconfiguration of having the VNC server port open on the GCP instance.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration of VNC Server Port being open in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to authenticate and authorize the GCP account using the Google Cloud SDK. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. Next, you need to install the Python client library for GCP. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   pip install google-cloud-storage
   ```

3. Once the library is installed, you can create a Python script to remediate the misconfiguration. The script should perform the following steps:

   a. Get a list of all the instances running in the GCP project using the Compute Engine API.

   b. For each instance, check if the VNC server port is open. You can do this by using the `googleapiclient.discovery` library to make a request to the Compute Engine API.

   c. If the VNC server port is open, use the `googleapiclient.discovery` library to make a request to the Compute Engine API to update the firewall rule and close the port.

4. Here is a sample Python script that you can use to remediate the misconfiguration:

   ```
   from googleapiclient import discovery
   from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials

   credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()

   compute = discovery.build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)

   project = 'your-project-id'

   def list_instances(compute, project):
       result = compute.instances().list(project=project).execute()
       return result['items'] if 'items' in result else None

   instances = list_instances(compute, project)

   for instance in instances:
       for network_interface in instance['networkInterfaces']:
           for access_config in network_interface['accessConfigs']:
               if 'natIP' in access_config:
                   instance_ip = access_config['natIP']
                   firewall_rules = compute.firewalls().list(project=project).execute()

                   for firewall_rule in firewall_rules['items']:
                       if firewall_rule['name'] == 'vnc-server':
                           if 'allowed' in firewall_rule and 'ports' in firewall_rule['allowed'][0]:
                               if '5900' in firewall_rule['allowed'][0]['ports']:
                                   compute.firewalls().update(project=project, firewall=firewall_rule['name'], body={
                                       "name": "vnc-server",
                                       "allowed": [
                                           {
                                               "IPProtocol": "tcp",
                                               "ports": []
                                           }
                                       ],
                                       "sourceRanges": [
                                           "0.0.0.0/0"
                                       ],
                                       "targetTags": [
                                           "vnc-server"
                                       ]
                                   }).execute()
   ```

   Note: Replace `your-project-id` with the actual project ID.

5. Save the script and run it in the terminal using the following command:

   ```
   python script_name.py
   ```

   This will remediate the misconfiguration by closing the VNC server port in all the instances running in the GCP project.
