### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Login to Google Cloud Console: Open your web browser and navigate to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google Cloud credentials.

2. Navigate to Cloud DNS: From the left-hand side menu, navigate to "Network Services" and then select "Cloud DNS".

3. Check DNSSEC Settings: For each of your DNS zones, click on the three-dot menu on the right side and select "View details". In the details page, check the "DNSSEC" section. If the DNSSEC is enabled, it will show the algorithm used for Zone signing.

4. Verify Algorithm: Check if the algorithm used is "RSASHA1". If it is, then it indicates that RSASHA1 is being used for Zone Signing, which is a misconfiguration as it's not recommended due to its vulnerabilities.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate Google Cloud SDK: Before you can start using the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine and authenticate it. You can download the SDK from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. After installation, authenticate the SDK using the command `gcloud auth login`.

2. List all DNS managed zones: Use the following command to list all the DNS managed zones in your GCP project:

   ```
   gcloud dns managed-zones list
   ```

   This command will return a list of all DNS managed zones in your project, including their names and DNS names.

3. Get DNSSEC details: For each managed zone, use the following command to get the details of its DNSSEC configuration:

   ```
   gcloud dns managed-zones describe [ZONE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace `[ZONE_NAME]` with the name of the managed zone. This command will return the details of the managed zone, including its DNSSEC configuration.

4. Check DNSSEC algorithm: In the output of the previous command, look for the `dnssecConfig` field. This field contains the details of the DNSSEC configuration of the managed zone. Check the `defaultKeySpecs` field under `dnssecConfig`. This field contains a list of key specifications used for DNSSEC. Each key specification has an `algorithm` field, which specifies the algorithm used for DNSSEC. If the `algorithm` field is set to `rsasha1`, then RSASHA1 is being used for zone signing.

#### Using Python

Detecting RSASHA1 usage for zone signing in a network involves querying the DNSSEC configuration of your DNS zones. Here's how you can do it using Python scripts:

1. Install the necessary Python libraries:
   You will need the `dnspython` library to interact with DNS servers. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install dnspython
   ```
2. Write a Python script to query DNSSEC configuration:
   Here's a simple script that queries the DNSSEC configuration of a given DNS zone:
   ```python
   import dns.resolver
   import dns.dnssec

   def check_dnssec(zone):
       try:
           answers = dns.resolver.resolve(zone, 'DNSKEY')
           for rdata in answers:
               if rdata.algorithm == 5:  # RSASHA1 is represented by the number 5
                   print(f"RSASHA1 is used for zone signing in {zone}")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Error checking DNSSEC for {zone}: {e}")

   check_dnssec('example.com')  # replace 'example.com' with your DNS zone
   ```
   This script will print a message if RSASHA1 is used for zone signing in the specified DNS zone.

3. Run the script for all your DNS zones:
   You will need to run this script for all the DNS zones you want to check. If you have a list of zones, you can modify the script to iterate over them:
   ```python
   zones = ['example.com', 'example.net', 'example.org']  # replace with your zones
   for zone in zones:
       check_dnssec(zone)
   ```
4. Analyze the results:
   The script will print a message for each DNS zone where RSASHA1 is used for zone signing. If you see any such messages, it means that RSASHA1 is being used and you should consider switching to a more secure algorithm.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the "RSASHA1 Should Not Be Used For Zone Signing" misconfiguration for GCP using GCP console, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and select the project where the zone is located.

2. In the navigation menu, select "Network services" and then "Cloud DNS".

3. Select the DNS zone for which you want to remediate the misconfiguration.

4. In the "DNSSEC" tab, check the status of your DNSSEC configuration. If it is not enabled, enable it by clicking on "Enable DNSSEC".

5. Once DNSSEC is enabled, click on "Manage Keys" to view the keys used for signing the zone.

6. Check if the key algorithm is set to "RSASHA1". If it is, then you need to create a new key with a stronger algorithm.

7. To create a new key, click on "Add Key" and select a stronger algorithm like "RSASHA256" or "ECDSAP256SHA256".

8. Once the new key is created, set it as the active key by clicking on the "Set Active" button next to it.

9. Finally, re-sign the zone by clicking on "Re-sign Zone". This will ensure that the new key is used for signing the zone and the RSASHA1 algorithm is no longer used.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "RSASHA1 Should Not Be Used For Zone Signing" misconfiguration for GCP using GCP console.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "RSASHA1 Should Not Be Used For Zone Signing" misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the steps below:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in GCP Console.

2. Run the following command to list all the managed zones in your project:

   ```
   gcloud dns managed-zones list
   ```

3. Choose the managed zone that you want to update and note down its name.

4. Run the following command to update the DNSSEC algorithm for the chosen managed zone:

   ```
   gcloud dns managed-zones update [MANAGED_ZONE_NAME] --dnssec-algorithm=RSASHA256
   ```

   Note: Replace [MANAGED_ZONE_NAME] with the name of the managed zone that you want to update.

5. Verify that the DNSSEC algorithm has been updated successfully by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud dns managed-zones describe [MANAGED_ZONE_NAME] --format="value(dnssecConfig.defaultKeySpecs[0].algorithm)"
   ```

   Note: Replace [MANAGED_ZONE_NAME] with the name of the managed zone that you updated in Step 4.

   The output of this command should be "RSASHA256", which indicates that the DNSSEC algorithm has been updated successfully.

6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for all the managed zones in your project.

By following these steps, you can remediate the "RSASHA1 Should Not Be Used For Zone Signing" misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "RSASHA1 Should Not Be Used For Zone Signing" issue for GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. First, you need to authenticate to GCP using the Google Cloud SDK and set up a project.

2. Next, you need to install the Google Cloud DNS API client library for Python using the following command:

   ```
   pip install google-cloud-dns
   ```

3. Once the library is installed, you can write a Python script to retrieve the DNS zone for which you want to remediate the issue. You can use the following code snippet:

   ```
   from google.cloud import dns

   # Authenticate to GCP
   client = dns.Client()

   # Retrieve the DNS zone
   zone_name = 'example.com.'
   zone = client.zone(zone_name)
   ```

4. Once you have retrieved the DNS zone, you can update the zone signing algorithm to use a more secure algorithm. You can use the following code snippet to update the zone signing algorithm to RSASHA256:

   ```
   from google.cloud.dns import record

   # Update the zone signing algorithm
   zone.dnssec_config.default_key_spec = record.RSASHA256
   zone.update()
   ```

5. Finally, you can verify that the zone signing algorithm has been updated by retrieving the DNS zone and checking the default key specification:

   ```
   # Retrieve the DNS zone
   zone = client.zone(zone_name)

   # Check the default key specification
   default_key_spec = zone.dnssec_config.default_key_spec
   print(f'Default key specification: {default_key_spec}')
   ```

By following these steps, you can remediate the "RSASHA1 Should Not Be Used For Zone Signing" issue for GCP using Python.
