### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, visit the Google Cloud Platform Console, and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to VPC Network: From the main dashboard, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the upper left-hand corner). Scroll down and click on "VPC Network" under the "Networking" section.

3. Check Subnets: In the VPC Network page, click on "Subnets" to view all the subnets in your network. 

4. Check Private Access: For each subnet, check the "Private Google Access" column. If it is set to "Off", then private access is not enabled for that subnet.

#### Using CLI

1. First, you need to install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK (Software Development Kit) if you haven't done so already. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions provided.

2. Once the SDK is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and authenticate your Google Cloud account by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to log in with your Google account.

3. Now, you can list all the subnets in your project by running the following command:
   ```
   gcloud compute networks subnets list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all subnets in your project, along with their details.

4. To check if private access is enabled for each subnet, you need to look at the 'Private IP Google Access' field in the output of the previous command. If it says 'On', then private access is enabled for that subnet. If it says 'Off', then private access is not enabled. You can use the following command to filter the output and only show the subnets where private access is not enabled:
   ```
   gcloud compute networks subnets list --filter="privateIpGoogleAccess=DISABLED"
   ```
   This command will return a list of all subnets where private access is not enabled.

#### Using Python

Detecting whether private access is enabled for subnets in a network can be done using the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) or using the Google Cloud Client Libraries for Python. Here are the steps to do it using Python:

1. Install the Google Cloud Client Libraries for Python. You can do this using pip:

```python
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-compute
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and initialize the client:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

client = compute_v1.SubnetworksClient()
```

3. Define a function to check whether private access is enabled for a subnet:

```python
def check_private_access(project_id, region, subnet_name):
    subnet = client.get(project=project_id, region=region, subnetwork=subnet_name)

    if subnet.private_ip_google_access:
        print(f"Private access is enabled for subnet {subnet_name}")
    else:
        print(f"Private access is not enabled for subnet {subnet_name}")
```

4. Call the function with the necessary parameters:

```python
check_private_access('my-project-id', 'us-central1', 'my-subnet')
```

This script will print whether private access is enabled for the specified subnet. You can modify it to check multiple subnets or regions as necessary.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Private Access Should Be Enabled For Subnets" in GCP using GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Login to your GCP console.
2. Navigate to the VPC network page by clicking on the hamburger menu on the top left corner and selecting "VPC network" under the "NETWORKING" section.
3. Click on the name of the VPC network that contains the subnet you want to edit.
4. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
5. Scroll down to the "Private Google access" section.
6. Enable the "Private Google access" toggle switch.
7. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page.

By performing these steps, you have enabled private access for your subnets in GCP. This ensures that your resources running in the subnets can access Google APIs and services privately without going over the internet.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the misconfiguration "Private Access Should Be Enabled For Subnets" for GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP Console by clicking on the terminal icon in the top right corner.

2. Run the following command to list all the subnets in your project:

```
gcloud compute networks subnets list
```

3. Identify the subnet that needs to be remediated.

4. Run the following command to enable private access for the identified subnet:

```
gcloud compute networks subnets update [SUBNET_NAME] --enable-private-ip-google-access
```

Replace [SUBNET_NAME] with the name of the subnet that needs to be remediated.

5. Verify that private access has been enabled for the subnet by running the following command:

```
gcloud compute networks subnets describe [SUBNET_NAME] | grep privateIpGoogleAccess
```

The output should show "privateIpGoogleAccess: true".

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for any other subnets that need to be remediated.

Once you have completed these steps, private access will be enabled for the specified subnets in your GCP project.

#### Using Python

To remediate the misconfiguration "Private Access Should Be Enabled For Subnets" in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```
from googleapiclient import discovery
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials
```

2. Authenticate and create the GCP compute API client:

```
credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
compute = discovery.build('compute', 'v1', credentials=credentials)
```

3. Get the list of all subnetworks in the project:

```
project = 'your-project-id'
zone = 'your-zone'
subnetworks = compute.subnetworks().list(project=project, region=zone).execute()
```

4. Iterate through each subnetwork and check if Private Google Access is enabled or not:

```
for subnetwork in subnetworks['items']:
    subnetwork_name = subnetwork['name']
    subnetwork_selflink = subnetwork['selfLink']
    subnetwork_response = compute.subnetworks().get(project=project, region=zone, subnetwork=subnetwork_name).execute()
    if subnetwork_response['privateIpGoogleAccess'] == False:
        print(f"Private Google Access is not enabled for subnetwork {subnetwork_name}")
```

5. If Private Google Access is not enabled, enable it using the following code:

```
subnetwork_response['privateIpGoogleAccess'] = True
request = compute.subnetworks().patch(project=project, region=zone, subnetwork=subnetwork_name, body=subnetwork_response)
response = request.execute()
print(f"Private Google Access is enabled for subnetwork {subnetwork_name}")
```

Note: Replace 'your-project-id' and 'your-zone' with your actual project ID and zone name.

This code will loop through all subnetworks in the specified project and zone and enable Private Google Access for each subnetwork that doesn't have it enabled.
