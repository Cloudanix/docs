### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your preferred web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform web console and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to the VPC Network: From the main navigation menu, click on "VPC Network" and then select "Firewall rules". This will display a list of all the firewall rules that are currently configured in your Google Cloud environment.

3. Check for Open Kibana Port: Look for any firewall rules that allow inbound traffic to port 5601 (the default port for Kibana). You can do this by checking the "Targets", "Filters", and "Protocols / ports" columns of the firewall rules table. If you find a rule that allows traffic to port 5601, it means that the Kibana port is open.

4. Verify Source Range: If you find a rule that allows traffic to port 5601, check the "Source IP ranges" column for that rule. If the source range is set to "0.0.0.0/0", it means that the Kibana port is open to the entire internet, which is a serious security risk.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate the Google Cloud SDK CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions for your specific operating system. Once installed, authenticate it using the command:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. List all the firewall rules in your GCP project. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute firewall-rules list
   ```

3. Filter the firewall rules for any that allow traffic to the Kibana port (5601). You can do this by piping the output of the previous command to grep:

   ```
   gcloud compute firewall-rules list | grep '5601'
   ```

4. Review the output. If any firewall rules are returned, this means that the Kibana port is open in the network. Each line in the output represents a firewall rule that allows traffic to the Kibana port. The details of the rule, including its name, network, priority, source ranges, allowed protocols and ports, and target tags, are displayed.

#### Using Python

Detecting if the Kibana port is open in the network can be done using Python scripts. Here are the steps:

1. **Import Required Libraries**: The first step is to import the required libraries. We will need the `socket` library to create a socket and connect to the server on the specified port.

```python
import socket
```

2. **Create a Socket**: The next step is to create a socket object. This object will be used to connect to the server and check if the port is open.

```python
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
```

3. **Connect to the Server**: Now, we will try to connect to the server on the Kibana port. If the connection is successful, it means the port is open. If not, it means the port is closed. The default port for Kibana is 5601.

```python
server_address = ('your_server_ip', 5601)
try:
    s.connect(server_address)
    print("Kibana port is open")
except:
    print("Kibana port is closed")
```

4. **Close the Socket**: Finally, we will close the socket. It's important to always close the socket when you're done with it to free up resources.

```python
s.close()
```

This script will print "Kibana port is open" if the Kibana port is open, and "Kibana port is closed" if it's closed. You can run this script periodically to check the status of the Kibana port.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to remediate the misconfiguration "Kibana Port Should Not Be Open" for GCP using GCP console:

1. Log in to the GCP console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Go to the Navigation menu and select "Compute Engine".
3. Select the VM instance that has Kibana installed and running.
4. Click on "Edit" at the top of the page.
5. Scroll down to the "Firewall" section and click on "Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy".
6. Under "Network interfaces", click on the network interface that has the external IP address.
7. Scroll down to the "Firewall rules" section and click on "Allow HTTP traffic" and "Allow HTTPS traffic" rules.
8. Click on the "X" icon to delete both rules.
9. Click on "Save" to apply the changes.

This will remediate the misconfiguration by removing the rules that allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the Kibana port.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the Kibana Port Should Not Be Open misconfiguration on GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the GCP Console and go to the Cloud Shell.

2. Run the following command to get the list of firewall rules:

   ```
   gcloud compute firewall-rules list
   ```

3. Identify the firewall rule that allows traffic to port 5601 (Kibana port). Note down the name of the firewall rule.

4. Run the following command to delete the firewall rule:

   ```
   gcloud compute firewall-rules delete [FIREWALL_RULE_NAME]
   ```

   Replace [FIREWALL_RULE_NAME] with the name of the firewall rule identified in step 3.

5. Confirm the deletion of the firewall rule by typing "y" when prompted.

6. Verify that the firewall rule has been deleted by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute firewall-rules list
   ```

   The output should not include the firewall rule that allowed traffic to port 5601.

7. Once you have confirmed that the firewall rule has been deleted, the Kibana port will no longer be open and the misconfiguration will be remediated.

Note: Before deleting the firewall rule, make sure that it is not required for any other services or applications running on your GCP project.

#### Using Python

To remediate the Kibana port being open on a GCP instance, you can follow these steps using the Python programming language:

1. Use the `google-cloud-compute` library to get a list of all instances in the project.

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

compute_client = compute_v1.InstancesClient()

project_id = 'your-project-id'
zone = 'us-central1-a'

instances = compute_client.list(project=project_id, zone=zone).items
```

2. Iterate over the list of instances and check if Kibana is running on any of them.

```python
for instance in instances:
    # Get the instance's metadata
    metadata = compute_client.get_instance(project=project_id, zone=zone, instance=instance.name).metadata.items
    kibana_port_open = False
    
    # Check if Kibana is running on the instance
    for item in metadata:
        if item.key == 'startup-script' and 'kibana' in item.value:
            kibana_port_open = True
            break
    
    # If Kibana is running, remove the firewall rule
    if kibana_port_open:
        firewall_client = compute_v1.FirewallsClient()
        firewall_client.delete(project=project_id, firewall='kibana')
```

3. If Kibana is running on an instance, use the `google-cloud-compute` library to delete the firewall rule that allows traffic to the Kibana port.

```python
firewall_client = compute_v1.FirewallsClient()

firewall_name = 'kibana'
firewall_rule = firewall_client.get(project=project_id, firewall=firewall_name)

firewall_client.delete(project=project_id, firewall=firewall_name)
```

Note: This assumes that there is a firewall rule named `kibana` that allows traffic to the Kibana port. If the firewall rule has a different name, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
