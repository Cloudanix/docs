How to disable if firewall all ports are open to public?

#### Using GCP Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console using your GCP account credentials.
2. Navigate to the VPC Network section by selecting "VPC Network" from the main menu.
3. Click on "Firewall" to access the firewall rules for your project.
4. Review the existing firewall rules and identify the rule(s) that allow all ports to the public.
5. Select the rule that allows all ports to the public.
6. Click on the "Edit" button to modify the firewall rule.
7. In the rule configuration, review the source IP ranges or tags that define the allowed traffic. If it is set to `0.0.0.0/0` or any other overly permissive value, it means all IP addresses are allowed.
8. Modify the source IP ranges or tags to restrict access to only the necessary IP addresses or ranges that require access to your resources.
   - You can specify specific IP addresses or CIDR ranges, or use service tags to allow access from GCP services only.
   - If you have multiple firewall rules allowing all ports, repeat these steps for each rule.
9. Review the other settings in the firewall rule to ensure they align with your security requirements.
10. Click on the "Save" button to update the firewall rule.
11. Test the accessibility to your resources from unauthorized IP addresses to confirm that access is now restricted as intended.
