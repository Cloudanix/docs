### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (console.cloud.google.com), and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to VPC Network: From the main navigation menu, click on "VPC Network" and then select "Firewall". This will open the Firewall rules page where you can see all the firewall rules associated with your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project.

3. Review Firewall Rules: On the Firewall rules page, you can see a list of all the firewall rules. Each rule will have details like Name, Network, Priority, Direction of traffic, Action on match, Targets, Source filters, and Protocols and ports. Review these details for each firewall rule. 

4. Identify Misconfigurations: Look for any rules that are overly permissive. For example, rules that allow all traffic (0.0.0.0/0) or rules that have a broad range of ports open. These could be potential misconfigurations as they expose your network to unnecessary risk. Also, check if there are any redundant or unnecessary rules that could be removed to minimize the firewall rules.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate Google Cloud SDK: Before you can start using the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine and authenticate it. You can download the SDK from the official Google Cloud website and follow the instructions to install it. After installation, authenticate the SDK using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   This command will open a new browser window where you can log in with your Google Cloud credentials.

2. List all the networks in your project: Once you have authenticated the SDK, you can list all the networks in your project using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute networks list
   ```
   This command will return a list of all the networks in your project along with their details.

3. List all the firewall rules for each network: For each network, you can list all the firewall rules using the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute firewall-rules list --filter="network:<NETWORK_NAME>"
   ```
   Replace `<NETWORK_NAME>` with the name of your network. This command will return a list of all the firewall rules for the specified network.

4. Analyze the firewall rules: Now that you have a list of all the firewall rules for each network, you can analyze them to check if they are minimum. You should look for rules that allow traffic from any source or to any destination, as these can be a security risk. You should also look for rules that allow traffic on all ports, as this can also be a security risk.

#### Using Python

1. AWS:
   - Install and configure AWS CLI and Boto3 Python SDK.
   - Use the following Python script to list all security groups and their rules:
     ```python
     import boto3
     ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
     for security_group in ec2.security_groups.all():
         print(security_group.group_name)
         print(security_group.ip_permissions)
     ```
   - Analyze the output to identify security groups with excessive rules.

2. Azure:
   - Install and configure Azure CLI and Azure Python SDK.
   - Use the following Python script to list all network security groups and their rules:
     ```python
     from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
     from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

     credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
     subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
     network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

     for nsg in network_client.network_security_groups.list_all():
         print(nsg.name)
         print(network_client.security_rules.list(nsg.resource_group, nsg.name))
     ```
   - Analyze the output to identify network security groups with excessive rules.

3. GCP:
   - Install and configure Google Cloud SDK and Google Cloud Python SDK.
   - Use the following Python script to list all firewall rules:
     ```python
     from google.cloud import compute_v1

     client = compute_v1.FirewallsClient()
     for firewall in client.list(project='your-project-id'):
         print(firewall.name)
         print(firewall.allowed)
     ```
   - Analyze the output to identify firewall rules with excessive permissions.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate firewall rules being too permissive in GCP using GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the GCP console at https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Navigate to the VPC network for which you want to remediate the firewall rules.
3. Click on the "Firewall rules" tab.
4. Review the existing firewall rules and identify the ones that are too permissive.
5. Click on the checkbox next to the firewall rule that you want to modify.
6. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the page.
7. Modify the firewall rule to be more restrictive by updating the source or destination IP addresses, protocols, or ports.
8. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.
9. Repeat steps 5-8 for all the firewall rules that need to be remediated.

By following these steps, you can remediate the firewall rules being too permissive in GCP and ensure that your network is secure.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the firewall rules misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cloud Shell in the GCP console.
2. Run the following command to list all the firewall rules in your project:
```
gcloud compute firewall-rules list
```
3. Identify the firewall rules that are not necessary or are overly permissive.
4. Delete the unnecessary firewall rules using the following command:
```
gcloud compute firewall-rules delete [FIREWALL_RULE_NAME]
```
Replace `[FIREWALL_RULE_NAME]` with the name of the firewall rule you want to delete.
5. Modify the overly permissive firewall rules to allow only necessary traffic. You can use the following command to update a firewall rule:
```
gcloud compute firewall-rules update [FIREWALL_RULE_NAME] --source-ranges=[IP_ADDRESS_RANGE] --allow=[PROTOCOL]:[PORT_NUMBER]/[PORT_PROTOCOL]
```
Replace `[FIREWALL_RULE_NAME]` with the name of the firewall rule you want to update, `[IP_ADDRESS_RANGE]` with the IP address range that should be allowed, `[PROTOCOL]` with the protocol that should be allowed (e.g. tcp), `[PORT_NUMBER]` with the port number that should be allowed, and `[PORT_PROTOCOL]` with the protocol of the port (e.g. tcp).

By following these steps, you can remediate the firewall rules misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI.

#### Using Python

To remediate the firewall rules misconfiguration in GCP using Python, follow the steps below:

1. Import the required modules:
```
from google.cloud import firewall
from google.cloud import exceptions
```

2. Set up the GCP project and firewall client:
```
project_id = 'your-project-id'
client = firewall.FirewallClient()
firewalls = client.list(project=project_id)
```

3. Iterate through the firewall rules and delete any unnecessary rules:
```
for fw in firewalls:
    if fw.name == 'default-allow-http' or fw.name == 'default-allow-https':
        continue
    try:
        client.delete_firewall(fw.name, project=project_id)
        print(fw.name + ' deleted successfully')
    except exceptions.NotFound:
        print(fw.name + ' not found')
```

4. Save the Python script and run it to remediate the misconfiguration.

This Python script will delete all the firewall rules except for the default-allow-http and default-allow-https rules which are required for web traffic. By doing this, we are ensuring that the firewall rules are set to a minimum.
