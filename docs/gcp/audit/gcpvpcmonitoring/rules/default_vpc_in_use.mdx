### More Info:

Determines whether the default VPC is being used for launching new services or artifacts. The default VPC should not be used in order to avoid launching multiple services in the same network which may not require connectivity. Each application, or network tier, should use its own VPC.

### Risk Level

High

### Address

Security

### Compliance Standards

CISGCP, CBP, ISO27001, GDPR, SOC2, NISTCSF

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Default VPC should not be used" for GCP using the GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Login to the GCP console at https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Select the project that is using the default VPC.
3. In the left navigation pane, select "VPC network" and then select "VPC network".
4. Click on the name of the default VPC.
5. Click on "Edit" at the top of the screen.
6. In the "Edit VPC network" screen, uncheck the "Default" checkbox.
7. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

This will remove the default VPC from the project, which is a best practice for security and network segmentation. You can then create custom VPCs with specific configurations to meet your project's needs.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Default VPC Should Not Be Used" misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify all the GCP projects that are using the default VPC. You can use the following command to list all the projects: 
```
gcloud projects list
```

2. For each project that is using the default VPC, create a new VPC network. You can use the following command to create a new VPC network:
```
gcloud compute networks create [NETWORK_NAME] --subnet-mode=auto --bgp-routing-mode=regional
```

3. Once the new VPC network is created, you can move all the existing resources from the default VPC to the new VPC network. You can use the following command to move a resource to a new VPC network:
```
gcloud compute instances move [INSTANCE_NAME] --zone [ZONE] --network [NETWORK_NAME]
```

4. Once all the resources are moved to the new VPC network, you can delete the default VPC network. You can use the following command to delete the default VPC network:
```
gcloud compute networks delete default
```

5. Finally, you should update your organization's policies to prevent the use of default VPCs in the future. 

Note: Before making any changes to your GCP environment, it is recommended to test the changes in a non-production environment to ensure that there are no unintended consequences.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Default VPC Should Not Be Used" misconfiguration in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the necessary Python packages:

```python
pip install google-cloud-compute
```

2. Authenticate to GCP:

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from google.cloud import compute_v1

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path_to_service_account_key_file>')
compute_client = compute_v1.ComputeClient(credentials=credentials)
```

3. Get the list of all VPCs:

```python
vpcs = compute_client.networks().list(project='<project_id>').execute()
```

4. Check if any of the VPCs are default:

```python
for vpc in vpcs['items']:
    if vpc['autoCreateSubnetworks'] == True:
        print(f"{vpc['name']} is a default VPC and should be deleted.")
```

5. Delete the default VPC:

```python
compute_client.networks().delete(project='<project_id>', network='<default_vpc_name>').execute()
```

Note: Replace `<path_to_service_account_key_file>`, `<project_id>`, and `<default_vpc_name>` with the appropriate values for your GCP environment. Also, make sure to test the script in a non-production environment before running it in production.
