### Check Cause

#### Using Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: Open your web browser, navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account credentials.

2. Navigate to VPC network: From the main navigation menu, select "VPC network" under the "Networking" section. This will display a list of all the VPC networks in your GCP environment.

3. Check for Default VPC: In the list of VPC networks, look for a network named "default". This is the default VPC that is automatically created by GCP when you create a new project.

4. Check for Resources: If there are any resources (like instances, subnets, etc.) associated with the default VPC, it means that the default VPC is being used. This is a misconfiguration as it's recommended to create and use custom VPCs for better control and security.

#### Using CLI

1. Install and authenticate Google Cloud SDK: Before you can use the GCP CLI, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine and authenticate it. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```
   curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
   exec -l $SHELL
   gcloud init
   ```

2. List all VPC networks: Once you have the Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated, you can list all VPC networks in your project by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute networks list
   ```

3. Check for default VPC: The output of the above command will include a list of all VPC networks in your project. Look for a network with the name "default". If such a network exists, it means that the default VPC is being used.

4. Check for resources in default VPC: If the default VPC exists, you can check if any resources are using it by running the following command:

   ```
   gcloud compute instances list --filter="networkInterfaces.network:default"
   ```

   This command will list all instances that are using the default VPC. If any instances are listed, it means that the default VPC is being used.

#### Using Python

1. AWS:
   - Install boto3, the AWS SDK for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc.
   - Use the following Python script to detect if the default VPC is being used:

```python
import boto3

def check_default_vpc():
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
    vpcs = ec2.vpcs.all()
    for vpc in vpcs:
        if vpc.is_default:
            print(f'Default VPC is being used: {vpc.id}')

check_default_vpc()
```

2. Azure:
   - Install Azure SDK for Python.
   - Use the following Python script to detect if the default VPC is being used:

```python
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

def check_default_vpc():
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
    network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
    vnet_list = network_client.virtual_networks.list_all()
    for vnet in vnet_list:
        if 'default' in vnet.name:
            print(f'Default VPC is being used: {vnet.name}')

check_default_vpc()
```

3. GCP:
   - Install Google Cloud SDK for Python.
   - Use the following Python script to detect if the default VPC is being used:

```python
from google.cloud import compute_v1

def check_default_vpc():
    client = compute_v1.NetworksClient()
    networks = client.list(project='your-project-id')
    for network in networks:
        if 'default' in network.name:
            print(f'Default VPC is being used: {network.name}')

check_default_vpc()
```

Please replace 'your-subscription-id' and 'your-project-id' with your actual Azure subscription ID and GCP project ID respectively.

### Remediation

#### Using Console

To remediate the misconfiguration "Default VPC should not be used" for GCP using the GCP console, follow these steps:

1. Login to the GCP console at https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Select the project that is using the default VPC.
3. In the left navigation pane, select "VPC network" and then select "VPC network".
4. Click on the name of the default VPC.
5. Click on "Edit" at the top of the screen.
6. In the "Edit VPC network" screen, uncheck the "Default" checkbox.
7. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

This will remove the default VPC from the project, which is a best practice for security and network segmentation. You can then create custom VPCs with specific configurations to meet your project's needs.

#### Using CLI

To remediate the "Default VPC Should Not Be Used" misconfiguration in GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify all the GCP projects that are using the default VPC. You can use the following command to list all the projects: 
```
gcloud projects list
```

2. For each project that is using the default VPC, create a new VPC network. You can use the following command to create a new VPC network:
```
gcloud compute networks create [NETWORK_NAME] --subnet-mode=auto --bgp-routing-mode=regional
```

3. Once the new VPC network is created, you can move all the existing resources from the default VPC to the new VPC network. You can use the following command to move a resource to a new VPC network:
```
gcloud compute instances move [INSTANCE_NAME] --zone [ZONE] --network [NETWORK_NAME]
```

4. Once all the resources are moved to the new VPC network, you can delete the default VPC network. You can use the following command to delete the default VPC network:
```
gcloud compute networks delete default
```

5. Finally, you should update your organization's policies to prevent the use of default VPCs in the future. 

Note: Before making any changes to your GCP environment, it is recommended to test the changes in a non-production environment to ensure that there are no unintended consequences.

#### Using Python

To remediate the "Default VPC Should Not Be Used" misconfiguration in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the necessary Python packages:

```python
pip install google-cloud-compute
```

2. Authenticate to GCP:

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from google.cloud import compute_v1

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('<path_to_service_account_key_file>')
compute_client = compute_v1.ComputeClient(credentials=credentials)
```

3. Get the list of all VPCs:

```python
vpcs = compute_client.networks().list(project='<project_id>').execute()
```

4. Check if any of the VPCs are default:

```python
for vpc in vpcs['items']:
    if vpc['autoCreateSubnetworks'] == True:
        print(f"{vpc['name']} is a default VPC and should be deleted.")
```

5. Delete the default VPC:

```python
compute_client.networks().delete(project='<project_id>', network='<default_vpc_name>').execute()
```

Note: Replace `<path_to_service_account_key_file>`, `<project_id>`, and `<default_vpc_name>` with the appropriate values for your GCP environment. Also, make sure to test the script in a non-production environment before running it in production.
