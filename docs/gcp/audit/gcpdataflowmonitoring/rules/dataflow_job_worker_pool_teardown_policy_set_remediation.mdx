<Accordion title='Using CLI'>
To remediate the "Worker Pool Teardown Policy Should Be Set" misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI, you can follow the below steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud SDK Shell or any other terminal of your choice.

2. Run the following command to set the worker pool teardown policy to "delete":

```
gcloud container node-pools update [POOL_NAME] --cluster=[CLUSTER_NAME] --workload-metadata=GKE_METADATA --teardown-policy=delete
```

Note: Replace [POOL_NAME] with the name of the node pool that you want to update and [CLUSTER_NAME] with the name of the cluster that the node pool belongs to.

3. Once the command is executed successfully, the worker pool teardown policy will be set to "delete".

4. Verify the changes by running the following command:

```
gcloud container node-pools describe [POOL_NAME] --cluster=[CLUSTER_NAME] --format="json" | jq '.management.autoRepair' 
```

Note: Make sure to replace [POOL_NAME] and [CLUSTER_NAME] with the actual names.

5. If the output of the above command is "true", then the worker pool teardown policy has been successfully set to "delete".

By following these steps, you can remediate the "Worker Pool Teardown Policy Should Be Set" misconfiguration for GCP using GCP CLI.

<Accordion title='Using Python'>
To remediate the "Worker Pool Teardown Policy Should Be Set" misconfiguration in GCP using Python, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install the required libraries: 

   ```
   pip install google-cloud-logging google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2
   ```
   
2. Set up authentication to access the GCP project: 

   ```
   from google.oauth2 import service_account

   credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/service_account.json')
   ```

3. Create a Logging client to access the logs: 

   ```
   from google.cloud import logging_v2

   client = logging_v2.LoggingServiceV2Client(credentials=credentials)
   ```

4. Define the filter to search for the relevant log entries: 

   ```
   filter_str = 'resource.type="k8s_container" AND log_name="projects/<project_id>/logs/stderr" AND severity="ERROR" AND textPayload:"WorkerPoolTeardownPolicy" AND textPayload:"not set"'
   ```

   Replace `<project_id>` with your GCP project ID.

5. Retrieve the log entries using the filter: 

   ```
   response = client.list_log_entries(filter_=filter_str)
   ```

6. For each log entry, retrieve the relevant metadata: 

   ```
   for entry in response:
       print(f"Log Name: {entry.log_name}")
       print(f"Resource Type: {entry.resource.type}")
       print(f"Resource Labels: {entry.resource.labels}")
       print(f"Severity: {entry.severity}")
       print(f"Timestamp: {entry.timestamp}")
       print(f"Message: {entry.json_payload['message']}")
   ```

7. For each relevant metadata, remediate the misconfiguration by setting the Worker Pool Teardown Policy: 

   ```
   from google.cloud import container_v1

   client = container_v1.ClusterManagerClient(credentials=credentials)

   project_id = "<project_id>"
   zone = "<zone>"
   cluster_id = "<cluster_id>"

   cluster = client.get_cluster(project_id, zone, cluster_id)

   # Update the Worker Pool Teardown Policy
   for pool in cluster.node_pools:
       pool.management.auto_repair = True
       pool.management.auto_upgrade = True
       pool.management.auto_upgrade_maintenance_policy = {
           "window": {
               "dailyMaintenanceWindow": {
                   "startTime": "02:00"
               }
           }
       }

   # Update the cluster with the new configuration
   update_request = container_v1.types.UpdateClusterRequest(cluster=cluster, update_mask={"paths": ["node_pools"]})
   operation = client.update_cluster(update_request)
   ```

   Replace `<project_id>`, `<zone>` and `<cluster_id>` with your specific details.

8. Verify that the misconfiguration has been remediated by checking the logs again.
